	"WR-1699" `will put you behind bars forever if you've got one of their ships or outfits without permission`
	"WR-1700" `won't hesitate to take away your freedom if you've stolen one of their ships`
	"WR-1701" `don't take any chances when it comes to a misplaced ship or outfit of theirs`
	"WR-1702" `Have you ever `
	"WR-1703" `been down to Enif`
	"WR-1704" `stopped by Tarazed`
	"WR-1705" `gone to Tarazed`
	"WR-1706" `traveled through the Southern Rim`
	"WR-1707" `witnessed a Quarg Lindwyrm jump in with one of their jump drives?`
	"WR-1708" `looked over one of the Quarg's sleek Drakes?`
	"WR-1709" `seen a Quarg Wardragon up close?`
	"WR-1710" `seen the Quarg's Skydaggers in action?`
	"WR-1711" `seen how the Quarg decimate pirates with their Skylances?`
	"WR-1712" `seen how powerful those Quarg Skylances are?`
	"WR-1713" ` I wish the Quarg would share some of their technology with us.`
	"WR-1714" ` I'd love to get my hands on some Quarg tech.`
	"WR-1715" ` What I could do with some of that tech...`
	"WR-1716" ` Maybe someday we'll reach their level of technology.`
	"WR-1717" ` It's scary how advanced their civilization is.`
	"WR-1718" ` There's no way humanity could stand up to them.`
	"WR-1719" ` I doubt the combined Navy Home Fleet at Sol could match the power of one of those.`
	"WR-1720" `What is with zero-g cricket?`
	"WR-1721" `I don't get that zero-g cricket they play in the Core.`
	"WR-1722" `How are people into zero-g cricket?`
	"WR-1723" `How do people stay awake watching that zero-g cricket?`
	"WR-1724" ` I mean, `
	"WR-1725" ` Look, `
	"WR-1726" ` Like, `
	"WR-1727" `all they're doing is`
	"WR-1728" `half the time they're just`
	"WR-1729" `they spend a week`
	"WR-1730" `you can't call a sport a sport if you're mostly `
	"WR-1731" `all you're watching is a bunch of guys`
	"WR-1732" ` floating around `
	"WR-1733" ` floating aimlessly `
	"WR-1734" ` bouncing around a space station `
	"WR-1735" `trying to catch a ball`
	"WR-1736" `hitting a ball around a space station`
	"WR-1737" `while two of them go back and forth a bunch of times`
	"WR-1738" `and boosting about twenty meters back and forth every now and again`
	"WR-1739" `trying to hit a couple sticks off a few other sticks with a ball`
	"WR-1740" `. I just don't get it, man!`
	"WR-1741" `. It makes no sense!`
	"WR-1742" `. Don't get me started on the rules!`
	"WR-1743" `. Innings, outings, overs, it's ridiculous!`
	"WR-1744" `. Who's in and who's out? They never tell you!`
	"WR-1745" `. It's too bloody convoluted, the way people go in and out all the time!`
	"WR-1746" `. It sounds like a sport only aliens would play!`
	"WR-1747" `. Couldn't they speed it up a bit?`
	"WR-1748" `. How do they make a game out of that?`
	"WR-1749" `. And all they're playing for is a bunch of old burnt wood!`
	"WR-1750" `. And they're always up in arms about whether "underarm bowling" is legal!`
	"WR-1751" `. Zero-g lacrosse makes a lot more sense!`
	"WR-1752" `around a space station hitting a ball around a space station`
	"WR-1753" `I'm getting into zero-g cricket`
	"WR-1754" `I love watching zero-g cricket`
	"WR-1755" `You don't get a sport better than zero-g cricket`
	"WR-1756" `. That adrenaline you get when the bowler boosts down the sphere to throw the ball`
	"WR-1757" `. The exhilaration you feel when the batsman hits a perfect six`
	"WR-1758" `. The way bowlers can control the ball to fool the batsman`
	"WR-1759" `. That feeling you get when a fielder catches the batsman out with a well-timed boost`
	"WR-1760" ` and the way the crowd roars as it happens`
	"WR-1761" `, the crowd going wild`
	"WR-1762" `, and the release you feel as you see the ball getting knocked right out of the sphere`
	"WR-1763" `, how each test is full of tension and fortunes that are decided by each bowl and hit`
	"WR-1764" `; there's nothing like it in the galaxy.`
	"WR-1765" `; I don't get the hate for it.`
	"WR-1766" `... there are some truly phenomenal players out there.`
	"WR-1767" `... it's an amazing sport.`
	"WR-1768" `... it's like chess played in space.`
	"WR-1769" `...`
	"WR-1770" `If you ever get the chance, you should`
	"WR-1771" `One thing I'd like to do before I kick the bucket is to`
	"WR-1772" `Before you die, you've got to`
	"WR-1773" `For my next trip, I'm going to`
	"WR-1774" `see the Quarg ringworld in Enif. Isn't it amazing what they can do and we can't?`
	"WR-1775" `see the Quarg ringworld down south. It's such a magnificent feat of engineering`
	"WR-1776" `see the dragons of Skymoot`
	"WR-1777" `ski the slopes on Vail`
	"WR-1778" `go to Vail and do some skiing`
	"WR-1779" `go to Vail for a hoverboard course`
	"WR-1780" `go to New Switzerland. The slopes are much better there than Vail`
	"WR-1781" `go skiing on Antipode. It's not as busy as those overpriced resorts in Vail, not to mention cheaper`
	"WR-1782" `do some extreme rock climbing on Maelstrom`
	"WR-1783" `see the ancient cities of old Earth`
	"WR-1784" `tour through the megacities of Earth`
	"WR-1785" `see where our ancestors came from on old Earth`
	"WR-1786" `do a jungle trek through Amazon`
	"WR-1787" `tour the continents of Pearl and experience the biospheres of a hundred different planets`
	"WR-1788" `meet some of the Quarg around Tarazed`
	"WR-1789" `visit Luna and its enormous shipyard`
	"WR-1790" `see where Neil Armstrong, one of the first men to leave Earth, stepped foot on Luna`
	"WR-1791" `see the Plot Memorial on Chiron and take a look at the first hyperdrive ever made`
	"WR-1792" `watch the hovercraft races on Sunracer`
	"WR-1793" `relax at the hot springs on Calda`
	"WR-1794" `take a boat up the fjords of Flood`
	"WR-1795" `visit one of the pirate worlds, like Greenrock or Freedom, and experience life the way anarchists do it`

	"WR-1797" `When I was younger`
	"WR-1798" `When I was a kid`
	"WR-1799" `When I was your age`
	"WR-1800" `Long ago`
	"WR-1801" `Back in high school`
	"WR-1802" `A long time ago`
	"WR-1803" `I dreamed of`
	"WR-1804" `I had hopes of`
	"WR-1805" `I had dreams of`
	"WR-1806" `I fancied`
	"WR-1807" `I thought about`
	"WR-1808" `flying`
	"WR-1809" `owning`
	"WR-1810" `piloting`
	"WR-1811" `captaining`
	"WR-1812" `commanding`
	"WR-1813" `an Auxiliary. Too bad only the Navy can use those.`
	"WR-1814" `a Bactrian, but the Deep's government won't allow me to purchase one.`
	"WR-1815" `a Leviathan. The maintenance costs though? I'm not so sure anymore.`
	"WR-1816" `a Bulk Freighter. They may be slow, but they're worth their weight in gold.`
	"WR-1817" `a Protector. Sure, it's an ugly ship, but the firepower?`
	"WR-1818" `a Shuttle. A lot has changed since then!`
	"WR-1819" `a Flivver. Now, I could buy ten.`
	"WR-1820" `an Osprey. I still can't afford one.`
	"WR-1821" `a Corvette. Look how sleek they are!`
	"WR-1822" `a Sparrow. My parents talked me out of it, though.`
	"WR-1823" `a Star Queen. It's just too bad its crew quarters aren't as good as its passenger bunks, though.`
	"WR-1824" `a Scout. Something about exploring the fringes of human space still appeals to me.`
	"WR-1825" `I was born on`
	"WR-1826" `I come from`
	"WR-1827" `Before I bought my first ship, I lived on`
	"WR-1828" `I hail from`
	"WR-1829" `I'm a native of`
	"WR-1830" `My homeworld is`
	"WR-1831" `I'm from`
	"WR-1832" `I grew up on`
	"WR-1833" `I spent my childhood on`
	"WR-1834" `I lived most of my life on`
	"WR-1835" `I used to live on`
	"WR-1836" `New Sahara. It's not often you meet someone else from there.`
	"WR-1837" `Hope. If not for the Navy, I'd still be a human popsicle there.`
	"WR-1838" `Earth. I was lucky to escape that dump.`
	"WR-1839" `Earth. It may be the ancestral home for humanity, but that doesn't make it a nice place to live.`
	"WR-1840" `Earth. It may be the capital of the Republic, but it isn't the place for me.`
	"WR-1841" `Earth. Despite what you hear, there's still some countryside left there.`
	"WR-1842" `Earth. If you tried to look out the window of my old apartment, you wouldn't be able to see the bottom.`
	"WR-1843" `Chiron, one of the most populous planets in the galaxy. Look at me now!`
	"WR-1844" `Chiron. It was the first extrasolar planet humans ever colonized.`
	"WR-1845" `Chiron. I couldn't survive the universities, so I took up piloting instead.`
	"WR-1846" `Chiron. We've got the best universities in the galaxy!`
	"WR-1847" `Moonshake. I was a factory employee, but I saved up until I could afford a mortgage for a shuttle.`
	"WR-1848" `Valhalla. I still go there once a year to visit my family. It's not a bad place.`
	"WR-1849" `Midgard, and I fought my way from the mines to the stars.`
	"WR-1850" `Hephaesteus. I was a Syndicate employee for a while, believe it or not.`
	"WR-1851" `Hephaesteus. I don't know how people still live there, with all the pollution.`
	"WR-1852" `Foundry. I knew how to fly a starship before I turned fifteen.`
	"WR-1853" `Millrace. Life there sucked, but at least I got paid enough that I didn't have to stay too long.`
	"WR-1854" `New China. Whenever I go back there, I cram my cargo hold full of food first. People there always need it.`
	"WR-1855" `Bivrost. I had a place right outside Rainbridge.`
	"WR-1856" `Solace. My father was a rocket scientist, but I wanted to do something more with my life.`
	"WR-1857" `Asgard. Maybe I had it easy, but I still invest most of my earnings.`
	"WR-1858" `Reunion. I owned a farm, until I sold it in exchange for this beauty.`
	"WR-1859" `New Britain. I grew up around the birds, and I always dreamed of flying like them.`
	"WR-1860" `Bourne, but there's nothing for me there now.`
	"WR-1861" `Prime. It's about as far away from Sol as you can get while still being somewhere civilized.`
	"WR-1862" `Prime. My parents both were engineers for Betelgeuse Shipyards, so I learned my way around a starship at a young age.`
	"WR-1863" `Maker. I spent ten years in the mines, and got a starship out of it.`
	"WR-1864" `Sunracer. I was my school's hovercraft racing champion three years in a row.`
	"WR-1865" `Mars. Sometimes when it's been a hard run between stops, I wish I still lived there.`
	"WR-1866" `Haze. Other planets always smell strange, to me.`
	"WR-1867" `Tinker, but I wasn't cut out for manufacturing work.`
	"WR-1868" `Burden. Everyone laughs about my height, but nobody jokes about my muscles.`
	"WR-1869" `Follower. They like to talk about how great the terraforming is there, but my city was lost to one of the disasters.`
	"WR-1870" `Skymoot. You'd think the dragons would be a nuisance, but most people who live there actually live on the other continent.`
	"WR-1871" `the Moon. I used to work at the Tycho shipyards, but now I'm flying in this ship.`
	"WR-1872" `Thule. You can tell my accent's changed after all these years of flying, though.`
	"WR-1873" `Longjump. When I can, I go back every August for Han Sizer month.`
	"WR-1874" `New Greenland. It's not as cold as other people think.`
	"WR-1875" `Relic. The first time I saw a Cruiser, I knew I wanted to be a starship pilot.`
	"WR-1876" `Shangri-La. My family lived quite well, until pirates came and raided the planet.`
	"WR-1877" `Zug. I used to watch the militia ships fight against the pirate ships in the sky from my porch.`
	"WR-1878" `New Holland. It gets too boring there, though, so I fly the stars instead.`
	"WR-1879" `Bounty. I bought my first ship when the manufacturing industry started to develop there.`
	"WR-1880" `Magellan`
	"WR-1881" `Dehydrated`
	"WR-1882" `Pontificated`
	"WR-1883" `General`

	"WR-1896" `Hi! Good to see you, uh,`
	"WR-1897" `Well, if it isn't`
	"WR-1898" `Hi there, uhm,`
	"WR-1899" `I've been trying to get a hold of you,`
	"WR-1900" ` Captain <last>. `
	"WR-1901" `I'm living the dream as a CEO of my own company.`
	"WR-1902" `I used to be just like you, but now I'm really somebody!`
	"WR-1903" `Don't you want to be your own boss?`
	"WR-1904" `Everybody is talking about this slick new trend!`
	"WR-1905" `You could get rich selling for me!`
	"WR-1906" `Get in on the ground floor!`
	"WR-1907" `We're about to go orbital, you should sign up while you still can!`
	"WR-1908" `Find me`
	"WR-1909" `You can get me`
	"WR-1910" `Call me`
	"WR-1911" `Drop me a line`
	"WR-1912" `Buzz me`
	"WR-1913" ` at ${pyramid scheme company}. `
	"WR-1914" `Ask for ${human names} ${family names}.`
	"WR-1915" `Tell them ${human names} ${family names} sent you.`
	"WR-1916" `Mention my name, ${human names} ${family names}, for a discount on your first order!`
	"WR-1917" `All I want is one day without running into`
	"WR-1918" `I just bought this ship and it already has`
	"WR-1919" `The warranty for my ship expired a week ago, and wouldn't you know it, I just found`
	"WR-1920" `a fuel leak!`
	"WR-1921" `a loose coupling!`
	"WR-1922" `a fault in my nav-array!`
	"WR-1923" `a cascading failure in the power supply!`
	"WR-1924" `a severe oxygen leak!`
	"WR-1925" `an engine overheating!`
	"WR-1926" `unsynchronized repulsors!`
	"WR-1927" `a parasitic shield discharge!`
	"WR-1928" `a leaky fuel cell!`
	"WR-1929" `The maintenance on this old bucket will cripple me.`
	"WR-1930" `It's just one thing after another on these old ships.`
	"WR-1931" `I wouldn't complain, but today is my birthday!`
	"WR-1932" `And it's not as though parts are cheap these days.`
	"WR-1933" `It could be worse, I suppose. I could fly into a black hole.`
	"WR-1934" `It's not like the customers even care, they just want their cargo yesterday.`
	"WR-1935" `What else can you expect from shoddy Syndicated Systems manufacturing?`
	"WR-1936" `I'd repair it, but I got to pay my mortgage.`
	"WR-1937" `Do you know where I could fix it for good?`
	"WR-1938" `I'd love to know how other captains get by without these problems.`
	"WR-1939" `I just found out that a "duck" is a type of bird from Earth! Now I wonder why "duck tape" is named after it?`
	"WR-1940" `Apparently they want me to pay 5% of my paycheck for union dues! I'm gonna keep it. My boss is a good guy; he'll look out for me.`
	"WR-1941" `I saved up and bought extra bunk space so my wife could come on trips with me, and now she says "we need to talk." That can't be a good sign, can it?`
	"WR-1942" `I bumped into some nasty pirates last week. I had to dump my cargo to get away, and my insurance is not paying me back.`
	"WR-1943" `If you are in a tight spot with some pirates, just throw everything out the airlock. They will be busy scavenging it, and you will be out of reach when they inevitably come back.`
	"WR-1944" `When I was hauling food in the South I ran into pirates every damn week. Half the time I had to bribe them with my salary or with a part of my freight.`
	"WR-1945" `My friend was boarded by pirates and they took his engines. It would have been cheaper to just let them have the cargo.`
	"WR-1946" `You can often distract pirates with some cargo until the Navy rescues you. My old captain taught me this trick when we were ferrying in the Far North.`
	"WR-1947" `Pirates will always try to take your cargo, but if you drop some scrap their way, they let you keep the real valuables.`
	"WR-1948" `Whenever I see pirates, I immediately dump my freight. They would get it either way, but at least this lets me get away.`
	"WR-1949" `Ey Comrade, your ship has loaded on a planet? I have loaded a planet onto my ship.`
	"WR-1950" `Ey Comrade, you have cargo in your ship? I have ships in my cargo.`
	"WR-1951" `Ey Comrade, you have fighters in your bays? We have bays in our fighters.`
	"WR-1952" `Ey Comrade, you have warships that fire missiles? We have missiles that fire warships.`
	"WR-1953" `Ey Comrade, your ship has just fled from pirates? I have pirates who flee from me.`
	"WR-1954" `If you want to `

	"WR-1986" ` some `
	"WR-1987" ` a good set of `
	"WR-1988" `asteroid scanners so you can detect and target asteroids more easily`
	"WR-1989" `asteroid scanners. They make it much easier to target asteroids`
	"WR-1990" `asteroid scanners. You won't regret the purchase`
	"WR-1991" `asteroid scanners. If you don't know your way around asteroids, these will highlight and analyze their mineral composition`
	"WR-1992" `asteroid scanners`
	"WR-1993" `mining lasers. They're faster for mining than other lasers`
	"WR-1994" `mining lasers. They're specially designed to break apart asteroids rapidly`
	"WR-1995" `mining lasers. They yield you more minerals per asteroid`
	"WR-1996" `mining lasers. Your mineral yield will go up noticeably with a few of those`
	"WR-1997" `mining lasers. They're more precise than other lasers and preserve more minerals when the asteroid breaks up`
	"WR-1998" `mining lasers so you can finish your mining run before the pirates get to you`
	"WR-1999" `mining lasers`
	"WR-2000" `heavy lasers. Their high range makes it easier to destroy asteroids, and you can also use them to scare off pirates`
	"WR-2001" `heavy lasers. Because they have a greater damage output, they're faster at destroying asteroids`
	"WR-2002" `heavy lasers`
	"WR-2003" `tractor beams so pirates and rival miners can't steal your hard-earned ore`
	"WR-2004" `tractor beams. It makes ore collection just that little bit easier`

	"WR-11684" `All the Unfettered here seem busy, and you have to wait before being able to unload the medical supplies to the local hospital. After some time, a local worker gives you <payment> and tells you to drop the cargo at a specific location.`

	"WR-12941" `You see a shorter, younger Quarg, likely a child in Quarg years, being shown around the ringworld by an adult. It seems like the parent is teaching the child about the ring.`
	"WR-12942" `A Quarg is standing uncomfortably close to the walls, tapping it slowly with both palms. You observe it for a few minutes, until it stops abruptly and goes about its business like the others.`
	"WR-12943" `Usual activity in the ringworld is stopped by a few dozen Quarg in heavily armored suits moving at a quick pace and escorting a large, tube-like container which floats to accompany them. Other Quarg are quick to make way for the group, allowing themselves a great distance from the armored Quarg.`
	"WR-12944" `Some Quarg scientists are dragging along a whole train of linked lab carts, packed fully with utensils, chemicals, components, and reagents. It takes nearly half an hour before you see the last of the carts pass by.`
	"WR-12945" `Hundreds of Quarg are blocking one of the largest, widest corridors in the ring. They're all sitting down on the floor, staring down blankly in complete silence, with a scarce few seldom glancing up to the ceiling only to move their gaze downwards once again. You notice that Quarg who witness the scene stop all conversation and move elsewhere.`
	"WR-12946" `One Quarg walks up to you, and stares down into your eyes. It stays there in silence, just looking at you, before finally blinking once and moving along, disappearing into the ring's hallways.`
	"WR-12947" `A Quarg is overseeing the unloading of dozens of ship-sized cargo containers that have arrived in the ring. It seems to mentally count the cargo as it's moved out in perfectly identical sets. After what must've been thousands of cargo tons, it clicks off one of dozens of small dots on a data pad and begins counting again.`
	"WR-12948" `Two Quarg ships land at the same time a few hangar bays away from one another. They open their hatches, and what must be the ships' entire crews come out. Without a hitch the crew of each ship boards the other's ship and depart.`
	"WR-12949" `The Quarg seem to have set up some form of festival in the ring: endless stands stretch out as far as you can see, all displaying variations of the same orange-like fruit, ranging from impossibly smooth to unbelievably wrinkled, and also from sizes as small as a pea to as large as a watermelon. You can't figure what quality they like best.`
	"WR-12950" `You see one Quarg turn a sharp corner in what's a haste by their standards. When you look into the corridor it went to, you see it's a dead end, with the Quarg having inexplicably vanished.`
