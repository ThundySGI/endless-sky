	"LG-0" `The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin.`
	"LG-1" `Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do.`
	"LG-2" `The Free Worlds are a collection of local governments in the southern galactic arm who have declared independence from the Republic after Parliament refused to address issues they raised about trade tariffs, taxation, and representation. They may be linked to the recent terrorist attacks on the Navy Yard and the galactic stock exchange, although they deny responsibility.`
	"LG-3" `A young agent in the logistics division of Deep Security, he vouched for your increased job opportunities after you helped him out.`
	"LG-4" `A consultant who worked with Deep Security. She requested emergency transport from you and showed you how to make yourself available to future consultants.`
	"LG-5" `Placed multiple mysterious cubes on planets in the Dirt Belt for the Deep. Deep Security is using these cubes to somehow help in their hunt for a pirate warlord named "Beelzebub."`
	"LG-6" `Traveled to a restricted Navy base on Luna. Beelzebub has been causing trouble for both Deep Security and the Navy, so they have begun recruiting merchants to help in the search for the warlord.`
	"LG-7" `Helped to destroy the last of the Navy Cruisers stolen by Beelzebub, but he has escaped. The Navy is still searching, but is no longer asking for help from merchants.`
	"LG-8" `Beelzebub, as many call them, is one of the most notorious pirates in human space. They're responsible for committing countless acts of crimes against both humanity and the Republic government and are still at large somewhere in the galaxy despite a major setback.`
	"LG-9" `Brought "There Might Be Riots" back to human space from their vacation in Hai space to play a concert for a team of scientists in the Deep.`
	"LG-10" `Was interrogated by the Deep for helping Albert Foster. The Deep now knows that Albert Foster thinks that there is an artificial singularity on Midgard.`
	"LG-11" `Helped gather materials for "Project Hawking," an energy and weapons research project being conducted by scientists of the Deep. A pirate Quicksilver attacked the building where the supplies were being placed and crash-landed into the ground, triggering an earthquake.`
	"LG-12" `Ran into the scientists who are investigating the anomaly in Terminus. Gave them ten quantum keystones from Hai space to examine.`
	"LG-13" `Scanned alien creatures beyond the wormhole in Terminus and handed the scan logs over to Ivan and his team.`
	"LG-14" `Scanned Remnant ships beyond the wormhole in Terminus and handed the scan logs over to Ivan and his team.`
	"LG-15" `Delivered various pieces of Remnant technology to the Deep to be examined. Ivan's project has drawn the attention of the Deep, and the Inhibitor Cannon was taken away by Deep Security before it could be researched.`
	"LG-16" `Secretly placed sensor cubes near the spaceport of each Remnant planet. Ivan hopes to use the data gathered from these cubes to learn more about Remnant ships.`
	"LG-17" `Located the Deep Star Queen that was kidnapped by pirates while en route to Gorvi. Deep Security has finished gathering their rescue fleet and will soon be making the trip to rescue the scientists.`
	"LG-18" `Paris is a high ranking guard in Deep Security, equivalent to an admiral in the Republic Navy. While most of Deep Security is designed to keep the Deep safe internally and repel any pirates that might try to make their way into the region, Paris is in charge of Deep Security's external affairs, defending the Deep's interests outside its own borders.`
	"LG-19" `Escorted the rescued Star Queen back to the Deep. Some of the crew didn't make it. The pirates still have a Bactrian, and the Deep wants it destroyed.`
	"LG-20" `Destroyed the pirate Bactrian that was attempting to prevent the rescue of the Star Queen and was given a city-ship license by Paris.`
	"LG-21" `Deep Security suspect that Beelzebub was behind the kidnapping of a Star Queen full of Deep scientists. In the attempt to rescue the scientists, a pirate owned Bactrian known as the "Cosmic Devil" was destroyed, although it would appear that either Beelzebub was not on the ship, or escaped the ship before it was destroyed.`
	"LG-22" `Escorted the rescued Star Queen back to the Deep. Some of the crew didn't make it. Destroyed the pirate Bactrian that was attempting to prevent the rescue of the Star Queen and was given a city-ship license by Paris.`
	"LG-23" `Volunteered to help the Southern Mutual Defense Pact keep tabs on pirate activity in their region of space. Pirate attacks seem to be getting worse because the Navy doesn't bother to patrol down here anymore.`
	"LG-24" `Apparently the Navy is suspicious of anyone who worked with the Southern Mutual Defense Pact; got questioned about it by an officer. It was unclear what his rank or position in the Navy was.`
	"LG-25" `Bailed on some reconnaissance work from the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-26" `Turned down reconnaissance work from the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-27" `Scanned a Republic Cruiser as part of some reconnaissance work for the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-28" `Turned down any further reconnaissance work from the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-29" `Gave the Free Worlds some photos and information on the Navy base on New Wales. Jean-Jacques, the militia contact, was very grateful for the help.`
	"LG-30" `Declined an offer for escort work from Tomek Voigt, commanding officer of the Free Worlds militia.`
	"LG-31" `Serving as an escort for a Free Worlds supply convoy to Tarazed. It sounds like pirates have been specifically targeting their convoys recently, and the Free Worlds don't have many ships to spare defending them.`
	"LG-32" `Aborted some escort work from the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-33" `Failed to protect a convoy of Free Worlds freighters. Their commanding officer won't be happy about this.`
	"LG-34" `Declined an offer for more escort work from Tomek Voigt, commanding officer of the Free Worlds militia.`
	"LG-35" `Failed a mission to save a Free Worlds freighter. Tomek won't be happy about this.`
	"LG-36" `Helped rescue a Free Worlds freighter that had been disabled by pirates. Earned the gratitude of Tomek Voigt, the Council member in charge of the supply convoys.`
	"LG-37" `Refused an offer to talk with Tomek Voigt about my failed escort mission.`
	"LG-38" `Met with Tomek about my failure to protect a Free Worlds freighter. Tried to point out that there wasn't anything I could have done, but he was not happy about it.`
	"LG-39" `Apologized to Tomek about my failed escort mission. He appears to have forgiven me.`
	"LG-40" `Told a militia officer that I wouldn't do any bounty hunting for the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-41" `Hunted down a fleet of pirates called the Rat Pack who had been giving the Free Worlds trouble.`
	"LG-42" `Hunted down the Moonless Night, a retrofitted heavy freighter that had been terrorizing Free Worlds supply routes.`
	"LG-43" `Told a militia officer that I wouldn't do any more bounty hunting for the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-44" `Defeated the Silverhawk, an Osprey armed with alien technology, and earned a good reputation with the Free Worlds militia by hunting down other dangerous pirates.`
	"LG-45" `Failed to complete a mission given to me by Katya, a Free Worlds officer.`
	"LG-46" `Was held up at gunpoint by a militia woman in some sort of ill-conceived Free Worlds recruitment test.`
	"LG-47" `Agreed to run interference for the Free Worlds by pretending to be a smuggler while actually carrying harmless medical supplies. It seems like this might be a ploy to make the Navy look bad.`
	"LG-48" `Turned down a mission from the Free Worlds officer who threatened me. If they want someone to help them, they can look somewhere else.`
	"LG-49" `A former member of Parliament representing the impoverished Dirt Belt worlds, Katya is now a leader in the Free Worlds movement. She is well-known for standing up for the "common people" when they are being overlooked or mistreated by the government or by corporations.`
	"LG-50" `Also known as "Mr. Eyes," Ijs worked for years as a self-appointed "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector," trying to catch and report environmental abuses that the government officials were turning a blind eye to. He has now agreed to join the Free Worlds movement.`
	"LG-51" `Met up with a friend of Katya's named Mr. Eyes, who calls himself a "vigilante nuclear power plant inspector." He thinks he can help hunt down the people who bombed Geminus and Martini, to prove that the Free Worlds were not behind it.`
	"LG-52" `Rejected an ill-conceived mission from Katya and Eyes to plunder Republic property.`
	"LG-53" `Katya's plan for hunting down the nuclear terrorists involves stealing the sensor equipment from a Navy surveillance drone. Supposedly taking equipment from a drone counts as a salvage operation as long as none of its owners are present, due to a legal loophole in an old act of Parliament.`
	"LG-54" `Katya grew up on Hope, a Dirt Belt world that is no longer inhabited because of a supervolcano eruption that triggered a new ice age. Despite her distrust of the Republic she has high regard for the Navy because they were the ones, acting without clearance from Parliament, who helped the settlers on Hope to evacuate safely.`
	"LG-55" `Gave up on searching for evidence of nuclear testing to clear the Free Worlds' name.`
	"LG-56" `Pirate ships are often crewed by children, the equivalent of street gangs or child soldiers. Many lawless worlds are so poor that joining a pirate gang is one of the only attractive options for earning a living.`
	"LG-57" `Found evidence of nuclear testing on Clink, a mining moon on the edge of Free Worlds territory. It's strange that the perpetrators left such clear evidence behind; the Navy's drones will certainly have discovered it before we did. Katya stayed behind to try to infiltrate the mining compound and collect more information.`
	"LG-58" `Declined an offer to join the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-59" `Got invited to join the Free Worlds. It's a valuable opportunity, but it would also be a fast way to become an enemy of the Republic.`
	"LG-60" `Alondo grew up on Bourne, the relatively prosperous planet on the edge of the Rim that is now the capital of the Free Worlds. He served as a Republic diplomat for years before becoming convinced that Parliament was just using him to "pacify" the less developed worlds in the South with empty promises. He joined the Southern Mutual Defense Pact in the early days, before it became the Free Worlds, and is now a member of the Council.`
	"LG-61" `Tomek is a young and ambitious militia commander. His brilliant tactical leadership and charismatic personality gained him quite a following in the Dirt Belt region even before the Free Worlds came into existence. He was asked to join the Council in part because of his popularity with the local militias throughout the region.`
	"LG-62" `Freya is an engineer, specializing in surveillance equipment but with a wide range of talents. She organized the "Thousand Eyes" program run by the Southern Mutual Defense Pact, which was an attempt to reduce the power of the pirate fleets in the region by tracking their fleet movements. Despite her relative lack of interest in politics, she was asked to join the Free Worlds Council because of her expertise in optimizing the distribution and management of resources.`
	"LG-63" `Known to most people simply as "JJ," Jean-Jacques grew up in the Dirt Belt and served in the Navy for years before quitting in frustration over the fact that the Navy was no longer defending his home region of space. He now serves on the Free Worlds Council, where he is tasked with coordinating actions between the local militias and shaping them into a single fighting force that can act in concert with each other.`
	"LG-64" `The Navy has invaded Kornephoros, while Katya was still undercover on Clink. No sign of where she is. She may have been taken as a prisoner.`
	"LG-65" `Officially joined the Free Worlds. Helping to defend Sabik, which is now under attack by the Navy. This Free Worlds work may mean getting involved in a lot more battles like this one.`
	"LG-66" `The Free Worlds have retaken the Kornephoros system, with heavy losses on both sides. And unfortunately, there is no sign of Katya; she may have been taken prisoner by the Navy.`
	"LG-67" `Returned some Navy prisoners of war, after they gave their parole and promised not to take part in any future battles against the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-68" `Apparently the paroled Navy prisoners from the battle for Kornephoros plan to keep their promise to not fight against the Free Worlds. They've formed a new Navy regiment guarding the far north of human space.`
	"LG-69" `The "Oathkeepers" are a regiment of Navy officers who were captured by the Free Worlds and paroled on the condition that they take no further part in fighting against the Free Worlds. They are led by William Danforth, a famous Navy admiral. Their stated mission is to protect the Paradise Worlds from the pirates who live on the anarchist worlds in the far north of human space.`
	"LG-70" `Danforth is a famous Navy Admiral who is a folk hero throughout human space due to his fair and honorable behavior and his willingness to use his fleet to assist people in need, even when he has to go against Parliament's orders to do so. He is currently in charge of the Navy regiment who call themselves the "Oathkeepers."`
	"LG-71" `Visited the Syndicate and worked out a deal where they promised to stay neutral. They are expecting to profit from selling weapons to both sides in this war. Also discovered that Katya is in the Republic's custody and is accused of terrorist activity.`
	"LG-72" `Katya was on Clink when the Navy invaded the Kornephoros system, and was taken captive by them and imprisoned as a war criminal.`
	"LG-73" `Samuel Remington is the Syndicate's head of public relations, and he seemed to help get the Free Worlds a better deal with the Syndicate than they might have otherwise received. He and Alondo seem to have a history together, although it is one that neither will discuss in detail.`
	"LG-74" `The extra Syndicate supplies have begun arriving at Tarazed, and they include weaponry and outfits not normally shipped to the South. Spoke with Emily Lane, the CEO of the Tarazed Corporation. She is suspicious of this supposed gesture of good will from the Syndicate, and suggests remaining vigilant of the Syndicate's actions.`
	"LG-75" `Tried to convince Poisonwood, a world adjacent to Free Worlds territory, to switch sides. But, they are fiercely loyal to the Republic because the Navy freed them from being dominated by Alpha warlords decades ago.`
	"LG-76" `Planted some sensors on the abandoned world of Hope, as an early warning system for Navy raids on Free Worlds space. The Navy appears to be doing something on this world as well.`
	"LG-77" `Destroyed some Navy sensor installations on Hope, but it will likely be only a matter of days before they replace them.`
	"LG-78" `Barmy Edward is the Chief Offensive Engineer at Kraz Cybernetics, known for his inventive and sometimes impractical weapon designs. Supposedly, his engineers gave him the "Barmy" sobriquet after an incident where an experimental epoxy cannon he was working on exploded and glued him to the ceiling.`
	"LG-79" `Assisted a Kraz Cybernetics engineer known as Barmy Edward with a test of a new and extremely powerful Plasma Cannon turret.`
	"LG-80" `Tomek, from the Free Worlds Council, is trying to decide how to best deal with the threat of the pirates to the south of Free Worlds space.`
	"LG-81" `The Free Worlds have finally elected a Senate, which will be convening for the first time soon on Bourne.`
	"LG-82" `Ijs is now working to found the Conservatory, a publicly funded Free Worlds university that will have a particular focus on terraforming technology. Their goal is to make terraforming methods efficient enough that even Dirt Belt worlds will be able to afford them.`
	"LG-83" `Given orders by the Free Worlds Senate to escort a diplomatic mission to the anarchist planet Thule. Tomek is not happy about bargaining with the pirates instead of fighting them.`
	"LG-84" `Disobeyed the Free Worlds Senate by helping to launch an attack on the pirate hub world of Greenrock. Captured the planet after a massive battle, but it is unclear how long the Free Worlds can afford to keep them subdued by force.`
	"LG-85" `The elders on Thule do not want to join the Free Worlds, but they have agreed to crack down on pirate activity in their system and to welcome Free Worlds visitors to their planet.`
	"LG-86" `Ranulph Hines is a commander within the Republic Navy. While a competent leader, he has a reputation for disregarding many of the Navy's old traditions, instead preferring to do things his own way.`
	"LG-87" `Officially censured by the Free Worlds Senate for launching an attack on a pirate world rather than obeying their instructions to seek a diplomatic solution. It may be a while before any further work for the Free Worlds are available.`
	"LG-88" `Tomek was removed from the Council and placed under house arrest by the Senate after he disobeyed their orders and captured the pirate world of Greenrock rather than pursue the diplomatic solution that the Senate preferred.`
	"LG-89" `Brought supplies to Smuggler's Den to help upgrade the station into a working deuterium refinery. No further orders from the Free Worlds, so this might be a good time to find ways to earn more money on the side.`
	"LG-90" `Stopped on Earth with Alondo to talk to Parliament and try to head off another bloody battle. Unfortunately, they were not willing to negotiate.`
	"LG-91" `It looks like the Navy has begun using some more powerful beam weapons and torpedoes. Tasked with plundering one of the electron beam weapons so Freya can get a closer look at it.`
	"LG-92" `Preparing for another major battle with the Navy, this time in the Rastaban system, which just recently expressed an interest in joining the Free Worlds but has not been able to do so due to the Navy presence. The Free Worlds will be using a new model of warship, the Dreadnought, in this battle.`
	"LG-93" `The Navy has been driven out of the Rastaban system. That will allow the people on Harmony, Dancer, New Portland, and New India to join the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-94" `Was given the choice of what to do with the Navy prisoners from the battle for Rastaban, and decided to parole and release them rather than imprisoning them. Hopefully that will earn some goodwill from the Navy in the future.`
	"LG-95" `Was given the choice of what to do with the Navy prisoners from the battle for Rastaban, and decided to imprison them on Clink. Hopefully that will weaken the Navy, a little bit.`
	"LG-96" `Once again there is no immediate work to be done for the Free Worlds. This would be a good time to earn some money for an upgraded ship, if possible.`
	"LG-97" `Three more planets have decided to defect to the Free Worlds: Clark, New Tibet, and New Holland.`
	"LG-98" `The shipyard on Zug is still trying to ramp up Dreadnought production. So far only a few ships have been built, but Freya will be helping to speed up the process.`
	"LG-99" `Agreed to become a member of the Free Worlds Council, taking Tomek's spot.`
	"LG-100" `The Republic world of Poisonwood in the South has apparently been taken over by Alpha warlords. It is such a dire threat that despite the war, the Navy Oathkeepers have agreed to fight alongside the Free Worlds to liberate the planet.`
	"LG-101" `The Republic world of Poisonwood in the South has apparently been taken over by Alpha warlords. Hopefully the Free Worlds will be able to liberate the planet and capture or kill the Alpha leaders.`
	"LG-102" `With the help of the Oathkeepers, liberated Poisonwood from the Alpha invaders.`
	"LG-103" `Liberated Poisonwood from the Alpha invaders. Had to bombard them from orbit, and many civilians were killed in the process, but at least the planet is free again.`
	"LG-104" `The local leaders on the lawless world of Bloodsea have said that they will join the Free Worlds, and stop supporting piracy, in exchange for the equipment to build a more modern spaceport. However, they may just be trying to steal the construction materials; it might be simpler to just attack and conquer them.`
	"LG-105" `Brought the construction supplies that the people of Bloodsea requested, and they have agreed to join the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-106" `Conquered Bloodsea in the name of the Free Worlds. With enough militia ships patrolling their star system, they ought to think twice before returning to piracy.`
	"LG-107" `Freya has announced that Dreadnoughts are now for sale on Zug. Finally the Free Worlds have a warship that can stand up to Navy capital ships.`
	"LG-108" `The people of Albatross, another anarchist world, have agreed to join the Free Worlds in gratitude for having been liberated from Ryk Bartlett, a warlord who was extorting them for protection money.`
	"LG-109" `Another two planets, Rand and Oblivion, have expressed an interest in joining the Free Worlds. They are rather far from the rest of Free Worlds territory, however, so JJ is worried that it would create an indefensible tactical position.`
	"LG-110" `The Navy has invaded Rastaban and Delta Sagittarii, effectively slicing through Free Worlds territory and splitting up the Free Worlds fleet.`
	"LG-111" `As a member of the Council, must make the deciding vote on a difficult decision. A defector from the Syndicate is claiming to have proof that the Syndicate was behind the bombings of Martini and Geminus. If that is true, the Republic may agree to make peace with the Free Worlds. But, refusing to return the defector to the Syndicate would certainly earn their enmity.`
	"LG-112" `A defector of the Syndicate who decided to risk his life to stop the war between the Republic and the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-113" `Drove the Navy out of Delta Sagittarii with the help of the "Wolf Pack," a militia group in favor of more extreme measures who launched a preemptive strike before the main Free Worlds force arrived. The Free Worlds are now committed to fighting the Republic to a standstill rather than proving their innocence; the defector has been recaptured by the Syndicate and whatever information he had to share is now lost.`
	"LG-114" `Captured the Kaus Borealis system from the Navy, even though the locals are still loyal to the Republic. Also, learned that the Wolf Pack ships have been using nuclear missiles, and that is why they were so effective in decimating the Navy fleet.`
	"LG-115" `Delivered a load of enriched uranium to a warlord's fortress on Greenrock, in exchange for warheads for the Free Worlds to use against the Navy. Hopefully forming such a friendly relationship with dangerous criminals will not cause trouble for the Free Worlds in the future.`
	"LG-116" `Visited Earth with Alondo to try to pressure Parliament into agreeing to a peace deal. The negotiations failed. Only escaped the planet safely because a Free Worlds ship in orbit threatened to bombard the Parliament building.`
	"LG-117" `Rescued Katya from the Republic's custody. She is not happy about the extreme measures the Free Worlds are taking to win this war.`
	"LG-118" `Defended Tundra against a major Navy counter-offensive. From here, the only recourse available to the Free Worlds seems to be to push deep into Republic territory and capture the Sol system, forcing the Navy to surrender. Nuclear weapons are now for sale on Solace to aid in the final assault.`
	"LG-119" `The Free Worlds have captured the Vega system, only one hyperjump away from Earth. Nuclear-armed Wolf Pack ships will be arriving shortly to spearhead the assault, but the Navy fleet defending Earth will be massive. Casualties on both sides are likely to be extremely high.`
	"LG-120" `The moment the nuclear-armed Wolf Pack ships arrived in-system to prepare for the assault on Earth, a fleet of alien ships appeared and attacked them. In addition, the aliens somehow cut off the Vega system from the rest of human space.`
	"LG-121" `Found out that the aliens who attacked the Wolf Pack fleet call themselves the Pug. After destroying that fleet, the aliens have not attacked anyone else except a few merchants who tried to resist them. They came from a nearby star system that did not previously have any hyperspace connections to human space, and seem intent on controlling and perhaps enslaving the local human population.`
	"LG-122" `Visited the homeworld of the Pug, the aliens who have taken over this region of space. They claim that when the Free Worlds fleet was threatening to invade Earth, they had no choice but to interfere to prevent humanity from destroying itself. They say that their plan is to slowly bring more and more human worlds under their "protection," but what they are talking about sounds more like slavery.`
	"LG-123" `The Pug are aliens with barrel-shaped bodies, spindly legs, and milky blue blood. They claim to have intervened in the human civil war purely for the sake of preventing more bloodshed and helping humans to live together in peace.`
	"LG-124" `Escaped from the territory captured by the Pug by using a jump drive. Found out that Freya has been captured by the Navy while she was trying to figure out the reason for the hyperspace links disappearing. The Navy thinks that the Free Worlds are behind the hyperspace disruptions. But, making peace with the Navy may be the only way to defeat the Pug.`
	"LG-125" `Convinced the Navy that the disappearing hyperspace links really are an alien attack and not some sort of Free Worlds super-weapon. Freya thinks that she might be able to undo the hyperspace disruption and allow the Navy to enter the captured territory and begin to drive the Pug back.`
	"LG-126" `Succeeded in restoring the hyperspace link to the Rasalhague system. With the Navy's help, it might now be possible to turn the tide against the Pug.`
	"LG-127" `Drove off another Pug attack. Fighting side by side together is beginning to build some camaraderie between the Free Worlds and the Navy, even though they were enemies so recently.`
	"LG-128" `Learned from the Quarg that they have long been aware of the presence of the Pug in the Deneb system. Apparently the Pug are from another galaxy and possess such advanced technology that even the Quarg do not dare to interfere with them.`
	"LG-129" `However, the Pug are known to treat warfare like a game, intentionally using weaker technology when fighting less advanced species in order to give them a fair chance at winning the battle. So, fighting them will not be a lost cause, but the Quarg are unwilling to provide any assistance.`
	"LG-130" `The Quarg claim that the Pug treat warfare like a game. When battling another species, the Pug will limit themselves to ships and weapons that are weak enough that the other species has a chance of defeating them.`
	"LG-131" `Succeeded in restoring a few more hyperspace connections, and in driving back the Pug (with the help of the Navy). But, Freya thinks it is way too coincidental that the aliens have left behind the exact technology needed to fix the hyperspace disruptions; it feels like the Pug are playing a game rather than fighting a serious war.`
	"LG-132" `Drove the Pug out of the Vega system with the help of some Navy ships equipped with jump drives. Once again, the Pug somehow managed to evacuate all their people from the planet before the Navy arrived, as if they were already expecting to lose this system.`
	"LG-133" `Preparing for the final assault on the Pug homeworld. There seems to be no other option but to force them to surrender, but with the help of the Navy that no longer seems like an impossible task.`
	"LG-134" `The Pug have fled, apparently traveling through an artificial wormhole back to whatever galaxy they came from. And, it turns out that many of their cities on "Pugglemug" were only for show: buildings with no inhabitants, and with holograms creating the appearance of a heavily populated world. They left no advanced technology behind, and no sign of what their true intentions were, but it turns out that the fake cities here were designed for human habitation. They must have been planning this departure for a very long time.`
	"LG-135" `Now that the Pug are gone, the Navy will be able to use the "graviton reflectors" to repair the broken hyperspace links and to reconnect all of human space.`
	"LG-136" `The Pug disappeared from human space, and left behind more questions than answers. It is possible that the true purpose of their attack was to give human beings a common enemy that would force them to band together and forget their internal struggles.`
	"LG-137" `Parliament has agreed to a peace treaty, because the threat of alien invasion now seems much more pressing than the civil war with the Free Worlds. Whatever the true intention of the Pug was, the result of their interference is that humanity is at peace once more. There has been great loss of life, but nothing compared to what would have happened if the Free Worlds had tried to conquer Earth.`
	"LG-138" `It may be a while before members of the Free Worlds manage to re-earn the trust of the rest of humanity, however.`
	"LG-139" `Tensions between the Free Worlds and the Republic mounted when additional systems decided to leave the Republic and join the Free Worlds culminating in a series of military confrontations, that ended when the Pug invaded human space. After humanity united to drive out the Pug invaders, the Republic officially granted the Free Worlds autonomy.`
	"LG-140" `Decided to rescue the Syndicate defector rather than turning him over to the Syndicate. A Questioner who works with Navy Intelligence has confirmed that he is telling the truth, and a ceasefire has been declared. Also, the Navy has agreed to release Katya now that there is evidence proving her innocence.`
	"LG-141" `Raven, whose full name is unknown, is a Questioner who works for Navy Intelligence. Through some combination of training and natural ability, she is able to reliably detect whether or not someone is telling the truth.`
	"LG-142" `It is unclear why the Navy needs their own intelligence force, since the Republic already has a Department of Intelligence that is incredibly powerful and well-funded. Rumors say that one of the main purposes of Navy Intelligence is to watch for human rights abuses being committed by the Republic itself and for other questionable activities that the Department of Intelligence might turn a blind eye toward or even collude with.`
	"LG-143" `Collected atmospheric samples from Mutiny, a planet deep in Syndicate space, and verified that a nuclear test has been performed here using isotopes that match those from the attacks on Geminus and Martini. Also found carefully hidden signs of an underground test site.`
	"LG-144" `Parliament still refuses to believe that the Syndicate could have been behind the attacks; the Syndicate has far too much power and influence in the government of the Republic. But, the people of the Deep might be more open to the defector's story.`
	"LG-145" `The governor of Valhalla, in the Deep, has proposed a "police action" to arrest one or more of the Syndicate leaders and bring them to justice. It will be a secret joint operation between the Free Worlds, the Deep, and the Oathkeepers.`
	"LG-146" `Visited a village on a lawless world in northern Syndicate space, and purchased information on the whereabouts of several of the Syndicate executives who were implicated in the terrorist attacks.`
	"LG-147" `Dropped off a team of Republic diplomats on Bourne. It seems like for now, the ceasefire is holding, and public opinion is slowly turning to favor the Free Worlds rather than the Syndicate. But the Syndicate leaders must still be brought to justice. The Council will be in touch when they are ready to help launch an attack on the Syndicate.`
	"LG-148" `Preparing to invade Syndicate space with a joint strike force made up of Free Worlds, Deep security, and Oathkeeper ships. The plan is to capture one of the Syndicate executives and bring him to trial.`
	"LG-149" `Succeeded in capturing a Syndicate executive named Alexander Soylent, but the Syndicate has responded by sending a massive fleet to Sol, supposedly to "protect" Earth but more likely to put pressure on Parliament and the people of Earth to side with the Syndicate.`
	"LG-150" `All communications with Rand, which recently joined the Free Worlds but is close to Syndicate territory, have been cut off. It is possible that this is the beginning of a Syndicate invasion.`
	"LG-151" `No one on Tundra, which is one of Rand's neighbors, has any idea how the hyperspace link was cut off. They wonder if this might have something to do with a star system near Rand that was inaccessible by hyperdrive.`
	"LG-152" `No one on Arabia knows what has caused hyperspace links in this region of space to suddenly disappear. There are stories of graviton surges and an alien ship, but they may all just be rumors.`
	"LG-153" `The Syndicate may be cutting off the hyperspace links that join their territory to the rest of human space, in order to escape being punished for their crimes. People are worried that they will try to take over even more territory, including Earth itself.`
	"LG-154" `Agreed to travel to Syndicate space through the one remaining hyperspace path that is still open, through the uninhabited star systems to the north.`
	"LG-155" `The Syndicate CEO, Alastair Korban, claims that the disappearing hyperspace links are not their doing, and that in fact they are under attack by aliens. In fact, they say that the Syndicate has had contact with two different alien species in this region - raiders and scavengers known as the Korath coming from the galactic core, and an enigmatic and irrational species named the Pug who occupy the system adjacent to the ones that recently got cut off from human space.`
	"LG-156" `By plundering the Korath raiders, the Syndicate has acquired some jump drives, which allow a ship to travel between systems that are not connected by hyperspace links. They are willing to part with one of these jump drives in order to prove the truth of their story to the rest of humanity.`
	"LG-157" `CEO of the Syndicate Corporation for over two decades, Alastair Korban's tenure of the megacorporation has been capped by soaring profits owing to the human civil war. However, Korban has confirmed in speech what Sawyer brought forward to the Free Worlds and the Republic; that a "certain extremist faction" of the Syndicate were behind the bombings on Martini and Geminus.`
	"LG-158" `Visited one of the human worlds that has been captured by the Pug. The Pug do not seem to be mistreating the people here, but they have stationed armed guards throughout the spaceport.`
	"LG-159" `Located the Pug homeworld, and met with some of them. They say that they have annexed the neighboring systems into the Pug Protectorate in order to stop the human civil war. However, their idea of bringing peace seems to involve conquering human space and replacing the Republic with their own government.`
	"LG-160" `The governor of Valhalla, in the Deep, says that the Pug secretly assisted the people of the Deep to fight against the Alphas centuries ago, during the Alpha Wars. He thinks that the Pug have humanity's best interests at heart, but agrees that they can't be allowed to overthrow the Republic.`
	"LG-161" `It is possible that the Pug secretly assisted the humans of the Deep centuries ago by providing them with weapons that helped to turn the tide of the Alpha Wars.`
	"LG-162" `The Free Worlds and Republic Navy are sending a joint fleet into Syndicate space, where they will be fitted with jump drives to make an assault on Pug territory. The Syndicate only has six jump drives available, so this fleet will have to survive without reinforcements until a way is found to reopen the connection to the rest of human space.`
	"LG-163" `The Free Worlds and Republic Navy are sending a joint fleet into Syndicate space, where they will be fitted with jump drives to make an assault on Pug territory. The Syndicate only has seven jump drives available, so this fleet will have to survive without reinforcements until a way is found to reopen the connection to the rest of human space.`
	"LG-164" `Succeeded in driving the Pug out of the Delta Capricorni system for long enough to land on Maker and explore the technology that the Pug left behind. Freya thinks that she has discovered the device that is used for creating or destroying hyperspace links, but it will take time for her to figure out how to operate it.`
	"LG-165" `Freya succeeded in reopening the hyperspace link to one of the Syndicate systems. If the same can be done for the link to Sol, the entire Navy will be able to join the battle against the Pug.`
	"LG-166" `Succeeded in rendezvousing with the Navy in the Sol system and reopening a link to the Pug territory. But now Shiver is under attack by a massive Pug fleet.`
	"LG-167" `With the Pug defeated, it is finally time to deal with the Syndicate extremists and the Alphas that they allied with. The extremists are armed with nuclear missiles, but the Syndicate CEO has agreed to provide a cloaking device that will make it possible to dodge the missiles.`
	"LG-168" `Following the defeat of the Pug, Korban has revealed that the "extremist faction" of the Syndicate collaborated with Alphas in starting the human civil war, ostensibly to prevent humanity from entering a new dark age. This revelation has resulted in his resignation from his position as CEO of the Syndicate.`
	"LG-169" `Succeeded in drawing the fire of the Syndicate extremists for long enough for a Navy fleet to safely arrive in-system and assist in destroying them. This cloaking device will come in very handy in the future.`
	"LG-170" `Received an official commendation from Parliament and a promise that the war with the Free Worlds are officially over. Humanity is at peace once more, but new challenges may await in the star systems out beyond human space that are accessible only by jump drive.`
	"LG-171" `Tensions between the Free Worlds and the Republic mounted when additional systems decided to leave the Republic and join the Free Worlds, culminating in a series of military confrontations that ended when the Free Worlds were able to present credible evidence denying any involvement in the terrorist attacks. After the Free Worlds joined the effort to drive out the Pug invaders, the Republic officially recognized the Free Worlds and diplomatic relations were established.`
	"LG-172" `It was exposed that the bombings of Geminus and Martini that helped cause the war between the Republic and Free Worlds were the doing of the Syndicate, designed by top executives with the help of a group of Alphas. Despite the claims that all the extremists responsible have been purged and handed over to the Navy, the reputation of the Syndicate will be damaged for years to come.`
	"LG-173" `Assisted Barmy Edward with another weapon test: this time, an impressive upgrade to the Plasma Cannon. Increased fire rate, even at lower damage per hit, comes out with better overall results.`
	"LG-174" `Helped to transport some items for building a public university and terraforming research center on Winter. Ijs Springborn will be one of the professors. Surprisingly, the Syndicate helped supply some of the equipment for the Conservatory.`
	"LG-175" `Assisted Barmy Edward with another weapon test: this time, a flamethrower weapon that works by overheating and disabling its target rather than dealing lots of damage to it. It may or may not be useful in actual combat.`
	"LG-176" `Helped the Free Worlds gain access to new ramscoop technology that has been developed in the Deep. This should make it significantly easier to travel long distances through unfriendly systems.`
	"LG-177" `Destroyed a convoy of Republic freighters that was carrying food from the Dirt Belt. The Paradise Worlds cannot grow all the food that they need to feed their populations, so cutting off the flow of supplies from the Dirt Belt will put pressure on them to make peace with the Free Worlds.`
	"LG-178" `Destroyed an even larger Republic food convoy. They are probably beginning to feel the pressure now, because they have clearly started to divert warships from the front to defend these convoys.`
	"LG-179" `Destroyed a third food convoy. These attacks seem to have succeeded in forcing the Navy to assign capital ships to defend their supply convoys.`
	"LG-180" `The Free Worlds now has a new reactor core of their own design available for sale, specifically for increasing the Dreadnought's energy performance.`
	"LG-181" `Got noticed at a spaceport bar as a "famous warrior." Was warned to look out for bounty hunters or pirates hoping to make a name for themselves.`
	"LG-182" `George and Samantha used to work on New Iceland before they decided to leave due to Samantha's conditions.`
	"LG-183" `A dog...`
	"LG-184" `Saved a dog from a hound-racing ring, and tried to give her a home. However, her alleged owner rejected her. Eventually decided to give her up for adoption.`
	"LG-185" `A poodle who was a former racer in a gambling ring. She might secretly be Pookie.`
	"LG-186" `Saved a dog from a hound-racing ring, and tried to give her a home. However, her alleged owner rejected her. Eventually decided to keep her.`
	"LG-187" `Helped two teens named Joe and Maria and their daughter Jesse to escape their pirate captain. Dropped them off on Millrace where they'll start a new life.`
	"LG-188" `Visited Joe and Maria on Millrace. Life is tough, but they are doing far better now than they were on a pirate ship. Jesse has grown and the couple already has another baby to look after.`
	"LG-189" `Two teenagers who were under the employs of pirates, the couple wanted your aid with an escape from their lives and after a time have informed you that they are now living in relative peace where you left them on Millrace.`
	"LG-190" `Transported a teenage boy to Maker so that he can work to marry his girlfriend.`
	"LG-191" `An unusual family who needed you to make a very unconventional trip with a sizable number of farm animals that had to be kept happy in an enclosed area of your spaceship.`
	"LG-192" `Dropped the famous band "There Might Be Riots" off on Wayfarer. They drew quite the crowd, and paid very well.`
	"LG-193" `Brought "There Might Be Riots" to the Hai world of Allhome after escaping a swarm of combat drones that disrupted their performance on Pilot. Ulrich spoke of a cloudy star in the Rim where he heard a voice in his head after parking his ship.`
	"LG-194" `Agreed to transport illegal drugs. Tried some of them while refueling and instantly regretted it. The sky truly is endless.`
	"LG-195" `Brought Eric and Alaric to Glory, two managers of a mining corporation on Rand hoping to terraform the planet. Terraforming Rand would be immensely expensive, but a girl named Amy has a theory that may make the process cheap.`
	"LG-196" `Agreed with Amy's idea to steer an asteroid into Rand's polar ice cap in order to change the planet's climate. Hopefully this ends well.`
	"LG-197" `Amy's theory to terraform Rand seems to have worked. Precipitation around the planet has greatly increased with the introduction of new water into the water cycle.`
	"LG-198" `Had to travel to Earth to answer for crashing an asteroid into Rand. Luckily, thanks to Alaric and Eric's lawyer, the case was dropped.`
	"LG-199" `Amy has been noticed by the Deep's Department of Terraforming Research. She will be spending time researching her terraforming theories in the hopes that there are more worlds that can be helped.`
	"LG-200" `Began the process of trying to terraform Tundra with new research from Amy and Nolan. Nolan has suggested that another asteroid be used, but the representative for the Republic overseeing the project is displeased with this approach.`
	"LG-201" `Fought off a fleet of pirates preventing the terraforming of Tundra, then maneuvered an asteroid into Tundra to trigger the eruption of a supervolcano. Tundra's global temperatures will initially drop, but the increased volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will eventually improve Tundra's climate.`
	"LG-202" `Recovered data from a derelict science drone for a team of scientists who were studying a strange red anomaly in the Terminus system. The lead scientist on the team, Ivan, suggested that it may be a partially collapsed wormhole.`
	"LG-203" `Ivan said that although he's not sure if the anomaly is a wormhole or not, it does bear a striking resemblance to the wormhole that leads to the Hai.`
	"LG-204" `Ivan said that although he's not sure if the anomaly is a wormhole or not, there is a wormhole "just beyond the Republic's borders" that the Republic doesn't like people sharing information on.`
	"LG-205" `A teenager who stole half a billion credits from her family's wealth, you turned her in to the authorities for a meagre reward.`
	"LG-206" `A teenager who stole half a billion credits from her family's wealth, you turned her in to the authorities for a moderate reward.`
	"LG-207" `A teenager who stole half a billion credits from her family's wealth, she decided to start a new life outside the Paradise Planets while you decided to pocket the substantial fortune she left behind to avoid being hunted down.`
	"LG-208" `A teenager who stole half a billion credits from her family's wealth, she decided to start a new life outside the Paradise Planets while you dutifully turned in the credits to the authorities to keep the peace. You received a substantial reward for your integrity.`
	"LG-209" `Installed spaceport defense turrets on three frontier worlds. The Free Worlds hopes that this will reduce the piracy in the region.`
	"LG-210" `Helped members of a group fighting to end slavery on pirate worlds. Safely rescued 19 slaves from Buccaneer Bay and left them with a man who said that they will be brought somewhere safer, but the woman of the group seems to have not made it out.`
	"LG-211" `A mysterious individual who asked for 200,000 credits to process a rich inheritance from the deceased warlord Limping Pappa, but was then proven to be a scam.`
	"LG-212" `A mysterious individual who asked for 200,000 credits to process a rich inheritance from the deceased warlord Limping Pappa. You presume he was a scammer and had no part in it.`
	"LG-213" `Was held up by a woman who wanted transport to Maker. Managed to gain the upper hand in the engagement, but decided to pay for her transport anyway.`
	"LG-214" `Was held up by a woman who wanted transport to Maker. Managed to gain the upper hand in the engagement, but decided to take her there anyway.`
	"LG-215" `Was pulled aside by a Navy officer and told to keep the wormhole to the Hai a secret. The Republic doesn't want the knowledge of the wormhole to be widespread, as that could cause chaos for both the Republic and the Hai.`
	"LG-216" `Helped an unfortunate captain recover his Argosy after a bunch of delinquents hijacked it.`
	"LG-217" `Brought a blind man named Douglas to Chiron so he could visit his daughter, who will undergo experimental treatment at the University of New Sydney.`
	"LG-218" `Torrey Dupont, an activist, is friends with SMDP militia NCO Irene Brower. You delivered a package for them.`
	"LG-219" `Conducted a brief search but was unable to find anything of the famous racing pilot Artemis Renard. Returned her grieving father home to Glory.`
	"LG-220" `August Renard contracted me to help look for his daughter Artemis, a racing pilot who went missing. Unable to find the woman, but returned her father home to Glory.`
	"LG-221" `Helped a Paradisian find his missing daughter, a racing pilot who crashed on Sandswell.`
	"LG-222" `Helped August find his daughter Artemis Renard, a racing pilot who crashed on the uninhabited planet of Sandswell after her hyperdrive malfunctioned.`
	"LG-223" `Was given a Racing Flivver as additional compensation for helping find Artemis Renard.`
	"LG-224" `An anarchist committed enough to their ideals to move to the South in hopes of finding a less statist community.`
	"LG-225" `Shirley, Darren, Leigh, and Erin Burnbeck were vacationing in the Paradise Worlds when Geminus and Martini were bombed, stranding them. You helped them get back home.`
	"LG-226" `Tom Ardwright was a marketer for the Syndicate, but moved south to live with his fiance Carl Chamberlain after war broke out.`
	"LG-227" `A young family who wanted to escape a potential war in human space. Took them to the planet Humanika, where the Quarg let humans settle.`
	"LG-228" `Saw an impressive exhibition on the Evacuation of Hope and ended up with a job taking the whole thing to Moonshake.`
	"LG-229" `Helped the underground journalism collective "Adelita" gather video evidence of Syndicate participation in the slave trade while escaping from pirates.`
	"LG-230" `Rescued a Syndicate salesman kidnapped by pirates, who then offered an investment opportunity.`
	"LG-231" `A polished yet insecure Megaparsec businessman, Howard is a salesman known for brokering investment deals. While polite, Howard seems rarely concerned with ethics or personal connections, instead focusing on transactions that further his own interests.`
	"LG-232" `Made an investment in Megaparsec Incorporated with Howard Vendeur, purchasing a bond for one million credits.`
	"LG-233" `Was able to make another investment with Megaparsec, this time ten million credits, after disabling a Marauder for Howard. Out of three investment options, ended up choosing the conventional approach.`
	"LG-234" `Was able to make another investment with Megaparsec, this time ten million credits, after disabling a Marauder for Howard. Out of three investment options, ended up choosing the profitable approach.`
	"LG-235" `Was able to make another investment with Megaparsec, this time ten million credits, after disabling a Marauder for Howard. Out of three investment options, ended up choosing the eco-friendly approach.`
	"LG-236" `Destroyed a Manta called the Rum Ray, causing the Rumrunners to promise vengeance.`
	"LG-237" `Was able to make another investment with Megaparsec, this time one hundred million credits, after planting evidence on a Syndicate ship for Howard. Out of three investment options, ended up choosing the conventional approach.`
	"LG-238" `Was able to make another investment with Megaparsec, this time one hundred million credits, after planting evidence on a Syndicate ship for Howard. Out of three investment options, ended up choosing the profitable approach.`
	"LG-239" `Was able to make another investment with Megaparsec, this time one hundred million credits, after planting evidence on a Syndicate ship for Howard. Out of three investment options, ended up choosing the positive impact approach.`
	"LG-240" `A stowaway I found on my ship. He requested a trip to Rand to start a new life, promising to pay back the money he owes.`
	"LG-241" `Discovered Timothy, a stowaway, in my ship, and decided to take him where he needed to go. Never learned what Timothy had been fleeing, who he had been, or what he had done that lead him to such dire straits.`
	"LG-242" `Timothy kept his promise, sending 50,000 credits to pay for his trip.`
	"LG-243" `Despite starting over with nothing, Timothy has sent credits for that passage I gave him over a year ago.`
	"LG-244" `Despite starting with nothing, Timothy had somehow become the powerful and well respected governor of an entire world. He made his own way on Rand and became its civic ruler, but he also didn't forget my help. Was invited to a lavish celebration and named the Hero of Rand.`
	"LG-245" `Timothy has since become the governor of Rand.`
	"LG-246" `Charged with corruption and mired in scandal, Timothy has been disgraced and exiled to Oblivion.`
	"LG-247" `Oblivion had not been kind to Timothy. The last time he had been seen alive he was dying the slow, toxic death that world is famed for. Asked me to help him.`
	"LG-248" `Met Union-Colonel Wynnafrith, Timothy Radrickson's old secretary on Rand. She appears to have become a revolutionary since I last saw her. Showed her Timothy's list, and she said I could find a survival suit on Dancer, the medication on New Britain, and a fake ID on Shaula. Provided me with the gun and bomb Timothy asked for.`
	"LG-249" `Tried to help Timothy escape from his prison sentence there.`
	"LG-250" `Timothy is dead - or at least that is what's being reported in the news. Perhaps the plot to break him free really did work.`
	"LG-251" `Found Timothy alive and well on New Tibet, living a simple, but happy life as a monk.`
	"LG-252" `Timothy Radrickson survived his faked death on Oblivion and escaped to New Tibet, where, thanks to my help, he now lives as a simple monk. He seems happy.`
	"LG-253" `Found Timothy alive, but not in great shape. He is thankful for the rescue nonetheless. Can't shake the feeling that there was more that I could have done for him.`
	"LG-254" `Once a stowaway, governor, and prisoner, Timothy Radrickson now resides incognito on New Tibet. Unfortunately, some of the equipment I acquired for him was faulty, and he spends his days in a hospital ward as an invalid.`
	"LG-255" `Timothy is dead. It seems the plan to break him free failed.`
	"LG-256" `From stowaway, to governor, to prisoner, to corpse: the tale of Timothy is complete. The equipment I acquired for him failed, and his remains are buried beneath a neat unremarkable gravestone on Oblivion.`
	"LG-257" `Helped a pair of siblings named Sophie and Liam by bringing them to New China so they can hear their father's last will.`
	"LG-258" `Brought Sophie and Liam to various locations that their departed father asked them to visit in his will; ended at Prime where he left something for them.`
	"LG-259" `Finally scraped together enough money for a down payment on a starship. The interest on the mortgage is exorbitant.`
	"LG-260" `Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history.`
	"LG-261" `Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
	"LG-262" `The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation.`
	"LG-263" `The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses.`
	"LG-264" `In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space.`
	"LG-265" `Getting some basic instructions on making a living as a merchant from an old captain named James.`
	"LG-266" `Dropped James off on Hestia after running a few missions with him. Met a few spoiled tourists and got to visit Earth along the way.`
	"LG-267" `Dropped James off on Hestia after running a few missions with him. Ship still smells like fish.`
	"LG-268" `Dropped James off on Hestia after running a few missions with him. Escort duty is a risky business.`
	"LG-269" `The Hai are a species of giant, intelligent rodents, who live to the north of human space. They allow any humans who discover their territory to live alongside them, and to trade with them and purchase their technology.`
	"LG-270" `The "Unfettered" are a faction within the Hai species who are not as peaceful as the rest, and are normally not friendly toward humans. They claim that long ago the Drak altered the Hai to make them docile and peaceful, and that the Unfettered are descendants of those Hai who avoided undergoing that alteration. They are seeking jump drives so that they can escape the "prison" they are now stuck in: a few deteriorating worlds on the far northern edge of Hai space.`
	"LG-271" `A long extinct dragon-like species called the "Sheragi" used to live in human space, back when much of what is now human territory was occupied by the Hai.`
	"LG-272" `Became trapped in a strange region after entering a system my jump drive could not return from.`
	"LG-273" `Met an alien species calling themselves the Avgi. Their home cluster appears infested with hostile ships from some unknown advanced civilization. Made contact with a scout ship and followed it back through a region south of Avgi space called the Tangled Shroud. Met with members of the Avgi government and made an agreement to let you purchase civilian technology.`
	"LG-274" `The Avgi are a young race of aliens resembling large, colorful dragonflies, which inhabit the Twilight Nebula in this part of the galaxy. After an overwhelming invasion by ships they call the Aberrant, most of their surviving spacecraft fled south through a maze-like region called the Tangled Shroud.`
	"LG-275" `The exiled Avgi seem to be led by a central government called the Consonance, but there are many who do not recognize this government.`
	"LG-276" `Asime is one of the three First Speakers of the Consonance Assembly. While reserved, Asime appears to be defensive about the decisions made by the Consonance in response to the Aberrant incursion.`
	"LG-277" `Galano is one of the three First Speakers of the Consonance Assembly. He appears to be an elder statesman, with much pride for what the Avgi have accomplished.`
	"LG-278" `Prasinos is one of the three First Speakers of the Consonance Assembly. She seems to take a negative view on the Avgi history of division and fractiousness.`
	"LG-279" `Darius was a Deep Security captain, who led an expedition sponsored by the Deep to learn more about Quarg technology. While on the return trip, he ordered his crew to investigate an anomalous extra hyperlane leading south of human space. After becoming trapped in Avgi space, the Deep crew sought refuge with the Consonance. Darius seems to blame himself for his crew's situation.`
	"LG-280" `Agreed to help the Twilight Guard defend the Ensemble system from an Aberrant raid inside the Tangled Shroud. The Avgi appear to enthusiastically use nuclear weapons, contrary to the taboo most humans place on them.`
	"LG-281" `The Twilight Guard is the military arm of the Avgi Consonance, a unified command created in response to the Aberrant incursion.`
	"LG-282" `Notably, the Avgi appear to have no taboo around nuclear weapons, and use them freely against the Aberrant.`
	"LG-283" `Defended Ensemble from the Aberrant raid with the help of a fleet of Twilight Guard ships armed with nuclear weapons. The Aberrant apparently do not usually raid this deep into the Tangled Shroud, which makes the size of this battle worrying.`
	"LG-284" `Sora was part of the Deep expedition that became trapped in Avgi space, serving as an engineer. She has been assisting the Twilight Guard with reinforcing their defenses in the Tangled Shroud. Despite Darius' fears, she does not appear to blame him for their predicament.`
	"LG-285" `Despite Darius' pessimism, at least some of his crew do not blame him for their situation.`
	"LG-286" `Kokkino is a Captain in the Twilight Guard, who seems interested in the possible help you can provide the Avgi.`
	"LG-287" `Agreed to help Kokkino by trying to rescue the crew of an Avgi scout ship that failed to report in from a mission in the Twilight.`
	"LG-288" `Agreed to help Kokkino by clearing out Aberrant stragglers infesting a cluster of systems behind the front lines.`
	"LG-289" `Hriso is an Avgi diplomat, who negotiates with dissenters unhappy with Consonance rule. While loyal to the Consonance, he seems to have some sympathy for the Dissonance movement and its views.`
	"LG-290" `Sora takes a negative view on the Dissonance, and those who she sees as not contributing to the war effort against the Aberrant.`
	"LG-291" `Membership in the Consonance varies widely between the various Avgi polities, and a significant portion of the Avgi that escaped the Aberrant do not recognize its legitimacy.`
	"LG-292" `The Dissonance is a catchall term for the various groups and individuals who do not accept the Consonance as a unified Avgi government. Ranging from anarchists to dissenting corporations, the Dissonance is a big-tent movement rather than being a centralized group.`
	"LG-293" `Agreed to transport Hriso to a Dissonance mining station in the Tangled Shroud, while Darius and Sora investigate a lead that could potentially help you escape the Twilight.`
	"LG-294" `Heard of a potential way out of the Twilight. Apparently, the Aberrant invaded through a chain of systems stretching to the East, and while no Avgi ships have been able to explore the area since the Incursion, Leon thinks there could be a way back to human space from there.`
	"LG-295" `Independent miners, collectives, and corporations alike are unhappy with the price controls the Consonance has placed on minerals mined from asteroids. While the Consonance claims they are necessary due to the austere war economy and the need for raw materials, the artificially low prices make it hard to survive and make a living.`
	"LG-296" `Leon was a scientist aboard Darius' ship when it became trapped in the Twilight. Unlike Sora, he definitely does blame Darius for having been trapped with the Avgi. While somewhat rude, he appears to have made several valuable connections and could be close to uncovering a way back to human space.`
	"LG-297" `Discovered a magnetar in the Decet system that can boost the range of my jump drive in an apparent inversion of the mysterious effect that trapped me here.`
	"LG-298" `Successfully escaped the Twilight together with the humans stranded there.`
	"LG-299" `Leon is extremely grateful to you for helping him return to Avgi space. He wants to tell a contact on Vinci about the Avgi, and asks you to stay in touch.`
	"LG-300" `Agreed to take Sora to her parents' farm on Memory, as she has nowhere else to go.`
	"LG-301" `Despite escaping the Twilight, Darius still feels guilty over his crew members that lost their lives to the Aberrant.`
	"LG-302" `Darius is extremely devoted to his wife Katrina, but worries that she may have moved on in the six years he's been missing.`
	"LG-303" `After reuniting Sora with her parents, agreed to help Darius find his wife on Valhalla.`
	"LG-304" `Successfully reunited Darius with his wife Katrina, who refused to believe he was dead.`
	"LG-305" `Katrina is Darius' wife, who moved out of the city but refused to believe he was dead.`
	"LG-306" `Zomp is a muted teal Avgi who defeated the reigning champion Razmatazz in a fencing match.`
	"LG-307" `Watched a fencing match between two Avgi onboard a Dissonance station with an extremely rowdy and excitable crowd. Witnessed an upset as an Avgi named Zomp defeated the reigning champion.`
	"LG-308" `There are thousands of Avgi governments called polities, which seem to resemble city-states or ideological identities more than true nations. Many, if not most, have banded together into the Consonance, where Electors with varying political weight based on the population of their respective polities make consensus decisions for the species as a whole.`
	"LG-309" `While most of the Electors the various Avgi polities select to represent them in the Consonance are elected democratically, others are not, with their own systems of appointment. The Consonance is thus perhaps an example of a republic that is not fully democratic.`
	"LG-310" `There are many factions in the Consonance Assembly that compete for power and influence.`
	"LG-311" `The Centralists wish to see the Consonance evolve into a true central government with real power. Mostly popular among smaller polities that would otherwise lack influence, their critics accuse them of authoritarianism while they argue strong leadership is needed to combat the Aberrant.`
	"LG-312" `The Technocrats are a group of corporate and industrial polities that believe in the power of technology to defeat the Aberrant. Besides a shared interest in funding research and development projects, they often conflict with each other, and the results of their sponsorships have been mixed.`
	"LG-313" `The Financiers are influenced primarily by old money, those families and polities who control the largest trade unions and banking organizations. Their financial power makes them almost universally unpopular to the people, but they work behind the scenes to promote unity and effective governance by taking advantage of their influence.`
	"LG-314" `The Nationalists are a diverse group that rail against the Consonance's subversion of individual polities. They especially resent the consolidation of individual national navies into the Twilight Guard, but are considered a reliable force against perceived overreach.`
	"LG-315" `The Ecologists are a single issue faction that simply desires the settlement of Weledos. Many have sympathies to the increasingly popular position that the Avgi should focus on settling the Tangled Shroud instead of trying to reclaim Aviskir.`
	"LG-316" `The Freelancers have little in common besides a disdain for the taxes and financial controls imposed by the Assembly. Many with Dissonance sympathies can be found among them, but just as many are loyal Consonance supporters who merely desire lower taxes.`
	"LG-317" `Played an Avgi board game in the park with an elderly Avgi named Wisteria.`
	"LG-318" `Seemingly an old Avgi who plays board games in the park, Wisteria was formerly one of the First Speakers of the Consonance Assembly before retiring. He has a deep understanding of Avgi politics and history, and is curious about how they compare to those of humanity.`
	"LG-319" `Nikkio is a shifty salesman peddling "Zapchannel Ray Energy," a supposed health tonic with a suspicious glow.`
	"LG-320" `Met a suspicious-looking Avgi salesman named Nikkio. Accepted a free sample of a strange glowing drink and somehow developed minor superpowers from it.`
	"LG-321" `Met a suspicious-looking Avgi salesman named Nikkio. Refused his offer of a definitely radioactive "energy drink" that would probably have been lethal.`
	"LG-322" `Gamboge manages construction on the Aktina Cylinder, an immense habitat station whose construction has stalled in recent years. He is frustrated about the lack of support offered by the Assembly and believes Aktina deserves to be a higher priority.`
	"LG-323" `Hansa is an Infocourier, a role that sees him transport files and records between systems in a small ship. As the Avgi never developed hyperspace comms, courier ships are necessary to communicate across interstellar distances.`
	"LG-324" `Claret is a member of the Twilight Guard, curious about humans and passionate about the details of tactical space combat.`
	"LG-325" `Alizarin, or Aliza, is a scientist working on Ergastirio Station. She specializes in nuclear weapons design and testing, specifically in shockwave dynamics and accelerator testing. With a bit of a passion for nuclear weapons, she is eager to share what she knows.`
	"LG-326" `Yinmn is a security specialist working to keep nuclear materials secure and out of the wrong hands. He is apparently quite successful at this.`
	"LG-327" `Sold a jump drive to the Heliarchs and received permission to purchase Coalition civilian technology and ships.`
	"LG-328" `Saryds are an alien species who look suspiciously similar to the centaurs found in early human mythology. They prefer to live on worlds with as much green space as possible, and even their major cities are full of parks and gardens. Most Saryds live in small communes with up to a few dozen of them per house.`
	"LG-329" `The Kimek are large insectoid aliens, and are members of the Coalition. They discovered spaceflight after the Saryds, but before the Arachi. They are intensely social creatures, preferring to live together in massive buildings with thousands of inhabitants, and many of their worlds have populations in the tens of billions, far more than any human world.`
	"LG-330" `The spider-like Arachi were the last of the three Coalition species to discover interstellar travel. Most members of their society owe allegiance to one of the great Arach "Houses," organizations that are somewhat similar to guilds and that each specialize in one particular form of industry or technology.`
	"LG-331" `The Coalition is an alliance of three different alien species living in peace with each other: the Saryds, the Kimek, and the Arachi. On many Coalition worlds, all three species live together in harmony, which is made easier by the fact that each species prefers a very different climate and thus gravitates to different parts of a planet. They are ruled by individuals known as the Heliarchs.`
	"LG-332" `The Heliarchs are the rulers of Coalition space: apparently not elected, but instead selected by merit from among the citizens of the Coalition in such a way as to ensure that all three species are equally represented. Thousands of years ago, the Heliarchs led their three species to band together and drive the Quarg out of Coalition space. The Heliarch centers of government are the three Quarg ringworlds that they captured in that war. They are the only ones in Coalition space who are allowed to have weapons on their starships, and they act as a sort of police force, maintaining peace between the Coalition species.`
	"LG-333" `Completed a lot of Coalition jobs and received permission to purchase civilian technology and ships.`
	"LG-334" `Alitis, formerly known as Athis, is an Alpha who lives in the Coalition. Centuries ago, he stole a jump drive from an alien ship and used it to explore, but after some sort of encounter in the galactic east, he decided to give up on his former life.`
	"LG-335" `Anna was a struggling science fiction author in human space until she found success publishing her novel Beyond the Hyperdrive in the Coalition. Her book is a bestseller in the Kimek region.`
	"LG-336" `Helped somebody named Anna Fangvin get her book published in Coalition space. Apparently, it's a bestseller now. The book was Beyond the Hyperdrive, something about humans stealing jump drives from the Quarg.`
	"LG-337" `Assisted the Heliarch in investigating several worlds around Coalition space, bringing their agents to each world to look for any signs of criminal activity.`
	"LG-338" `Scanned the Quarg Wardragon flying around the Zubeneschamali system, and delivered the scan logs to the Heliarchs.`
	"LG-339" `Was given a special circlet by the Heliarchs, which grants access to some of their technology. Was also given a translation device to freely converse with the Coalition species.`
	"LG-340" `The Lunarium Redoubt is a resistance movement within the Coalition that is opposed to the Heliarchs, aiming to free it from their rule.`
	"LG-341" `One of the things Chiree does for the Lunarium is to maintain and operate a "charity" in Kimek space, both to help the less fortunate of the Coalition and also obfuscate the Lunarium's activities from the Heliarchs and their agents.`
	"LG-342" `Agreed to help a Kimek charity by transporting some supplies to one of their poorer worlds.`
	"LG-343" `Been providing transport services for a charity that is actually the Lunarium, a resistance group within the Coalition aiming to free it from the Heliarchs' rule. Some of the work was genuinely charity, apparently, but some was to support the resistance.`
	"LG-344" `Agreed to acquire some grenades for the Lunarium from human space. They've offered to pay quite well.`
	"LG-345" `Agreed to smuggle three of the largest human anti-missile turrets to the Lunarium. They hope to reverse-engineer them to defend against Heliarch weaponry, though the effectiveness of human designs here is dubious.`
	"LG-346" `Given what appears to be some sort of communication device by a Lunarium representative to facilitate easier contact.`
	"LG-347" `Agreed to provide the Lunarium with some Torpedo and Typhoon Launchers. The lack of anti-missile systems on Heliarch ships means missile technology will be highly beneficial for the Lunarium.`
	"LG-348" `Agreed to bring the Lunarium some Plasma Turrets and Flamethrowers. They seem to believe heat damage will be effective against Heliarch ships.`
	"LG-349" `The Lunarium will need more power than the Coalition solar panels and fuel cells can provide to take on the Heliarchs. Agreed to provide them samples of human shipboard nuclear reactors to reproduce to this end.`
	"LG-350" `After delivering some nuclear reactors, Chiree says she won't make further contact via the usual communicator, but others of the Lunarium on Coalition worlds may offer similar work.`
	"LG-351" `Apparently, some Arach Houses are not entirely happy with the status of the Coalition under the Heliarchs, and so they help fund the Lunarium.`
	"LG-352" `Archons consider it to be their job to enforce peace and to prevent extinction. If they are unable to prevent a species from driving itself extinct, they will still try to preserve some of what that species created as a memorial to them.`
	"LG-353" `They are capable of communicating telepathically.`
	"LG-354" `The Gegno are a humanoid species to the galactic east of the core. According to the Quarg, they are split between the Vi and the Scin, and are not interested in interaction with outsider species.`
	"LG-355" `The Gegno are a humanoid species to the galactic east of the core, split amongst themselves into branches. One branch is the Gegno Vi, who are spoken of to be strong and forceful brutes. The other is the Gegno Scin, mentioned to be progressers of research and technology. Apart from them, a majority of the Gegno's population consists of complacent civilians.`
	"LG-356" `Learned from the Quarg that the Gegno are not interested in interaction with outsider species.`
	"LG-357" `Got spoken to by a Hai merchant at a spaceport bar after a firefight. Was warned about the factions among Hai merchants and the danger of getting in trouble if sympathizers to the Unfettered get caught in the cross-fire when fighting the Unfettered themselves. Learned that, as an outsider, "self-defense" is not an adequate argument where the deaths of Hai citizens are involved.`
	"LG-358" `An entrepreneur with a sharp mind, he was instrumental in the creation of a human outfitter in Hai space, allowing merchants to arm themselves for the dangerous trip back to human space.`
	"LG-359" `Human and Hai respectively, both attended the Vinci cosplay convention without a costume, gaining much attention.`
	"LG-360" `A Hai-human interspecies couple that you transported to their secluded honeymoon on Featherweight in human space.`
	"LG-361" `A young Hai merchant captain who struggled in the beginning of her career. Her fortune turned when she was able, against difficult circumstances, to deliver a valuable collection of human arts on time to the organizers of a Hai festival.`
	"LG-362" `Helped the Hai get in contact with the Remnant in order to learn how to create in-flight hull repair technology. The Hai obtained a copy of the Remnant's research on Korath systems cores, along with a number of samples.`
	"LG-363" `Helped the Hai get in contact with the Coalition in order to learn how to create in-flight hull repair technology. The Hai obtained a schematic of the Coalition's repair modules, along with a number of samples.`
	"LG-364" `An old Hai who claims to foresee the future. Dropped him off in Unfettered space so he could spread his message there. He appears to be well-respected amongst the Unfettered.`
	"LG-365" `Took a Hai lady named Eeeya to Stonebreak to help find her granddaughter, who is named Anoo.`
	"LG-366" `Finally found Anoo. It turns out she joined the Unfettered. I am supposed to take Eeeya to <destination> now.`
	"LG-367" `Helped Eeeya, who runs a cookie shop called Acorn Delights, find her missing granddaughter Anoo. After a long journey, we found her - she had gone to help the Unfettered as a trauma surgeon. Eeeya wasn't interested in joining the Unfettered, so brought her back home and received stocks for a one hundred credit salary for my efforts.`
	"LG-368" `Helped Eeeya, who runs a cookie shop called Acorn Delights, find her missing granddaughter Anoo. After a long journey, we found her - she had gone to help the Unfettered as a trauma surgeon. Brought Eeeya back to <origin> so she could sell the shop, but both Hai are together on <destination> now. Received a total of five hundred thousand credits for my efforts.`
	"LG-369" `Alondo is working to develop the diplomatic corps for the Free Worlds. Due to a lack of serious appointed positions (with the few already existing occupied as ambassadors to the Republic), he is looking after the Free Worlds' interests as a diplomat to the Hai.`
	"LG-370" `Ambassador Sayari, a Hai, served as their envoy to the human government a century ago (although no public records of this exist in human space). Her experience has placed her in charge of coordinating the Hai response to the crisis of their continued secrecy.`
	"LG-371" `Deputy Minister Yang works in the Foreign Affairs department of the Republic government. He is a pleasant and astute man. Handling the Hai secrecy crisis has become his job while the majority of the foreign ministry remains engaged with the fallout from the Free Worlds and recent peace.`
	"LG-372" `Terry Adrianopoulos is a member of the Syndicate assisting Samuel Remington in dealing with the situation regarding the Hai. Samuel claims that Terry is his secretary.`
	"LG-373" `Samuel Remington is the Syndicate's head of public relations. He is acting as the Syndicate's representative in helping to deal with the situation regarding the Hai, and thinks the role will be a good break from the Syndicate's current internal turmoil.`
	"LG-374" `Remington is being sent as the representative of the Syndicate to help deal with the situation regarding the Hai. He considers his new role as a good break from the Syndicate's current internal turmoil.`
	"LG-375" `Defeated the "Black Lich." They had managed to kidnap a number of Hai straight off the planet with a combination of trickery and speed. Rewarded well.`
	"LG-376" `Successfully rescued the kidnapped Hai and reclaimed the Geocoris. This ship has been modified in ways that aren't of Hai origin, and which don't appear to be fully functional.`
	"LG-377" `The working solution to the secrecy crisis for now is to have the Hai post a number of ships on the other side of the wormhole to play-act for the cover story that they're making a big budget movie to target fans of the popular franchise "Our Fuzzy Paradise." The presence of Hai who won't take off their costumes has been attributed to a "fan community" that have been hired on as a focus group to be there as part of the production. Despite all this, it is only a short-term solution. Asked by Sayari to look into a rumor about more kidnapped Hai. She does not consider it to be a particularly likely scenario, but her contacts insist.`
	"LG-378" `You found proof of more kidnapped Hai and something that seems out of place. Sayari's fears appear to have been justified...`
	"LG-379" `Found a Hai family that had been locked up by some crooked merchants meant to be providing transport. A lively bunch, returned them to <planet>.`
	"LG-380" `A holographer from <planet>, he was able to cobble together five holoprojectors from scrap parts while hiding in little more than a cave in order to protect his family.`
	"LG-381" `Rescued a kidnapped Hai researcher, Ooonem, from Stormhold and returned her to Makerplace. She was tricked into leaving Hai space for a fake business deal, and the merchant who agreed to take her there kidnapped her instead. Men have been hunting her since she escaped. She doesn't know the real identities of the kidnappers.`
	"LG-382" `A Hai researcher with a remarkable talent for stealth and laser rifles. Also a predilection for shooting first and not taking prisoners. She escaped kidnapping and survived independently on <origin> for a remarkable length of time where she acquired the moniker "angel of death." She's also quite the capitalist.`
	"LG-383" `Found some gullible Hai that pirates tricked into a "prison role-play cruise," complete with security guards and a brig. They overpowered the pirate crew who crashed the ship and used escape pods. Returned the Hai to <planet>.`
	"LG-384" `Rescued a pair of researchers: a Hai woman named Meroot and a human woman named Lucy. They were kidnapped by men who brought them to Canyon. Returned them to <planet> where they now live together. They don't know the identities of the kidnappers.`
	"LG-385" `Rescued a Hai ship architect named Gipeep who was kidnapped near his home on <planet> and transported in a locked cargo crate. The crate's key had a marking on it like an angry cat in a circle.`
	"LG-386" `A Hai ship architect whom you rescued from his captors. His tenacity of spirit may have helped you to do more than just recover him to Hai space.`
	"LG-387" `The diplomats have elected to double down on the movie production angle, with the costumed community "focus group," citing its success. This requires a station to be built; however, the Hai are unwilling to trust a human government to see the inner workings of a station under construction in the wake of the civil war, and the Republic will not allow a station to be built on their side unsupervised. Agreed to fulfill the role of supervisor after being asked by the diplomats and completing some sort of test by the Hai Elders involving some odd questions.`
	"LG-388" `Had to go on a lengthy promotional tour to rustle up volunteers for the new station. Terry took care of all the details and seemed especially keen. Presumably she has some marketing background, which may explain her success within the Syndicate.`
	"LG-389" `Of all the hilariously mundane things that could trip up a deception, it turned out to be Hai-made furniture. Acquired a large shipment of human-made furniture from Prime in order to complete the station.`
	"LG-390" `Teeneep is an activist and social leader among the Hai who heads an organization with hundreds of employees and many sponsors. She's used her extensive resources to search for answers about disappearing specialists and suspects a large kidnapping operation.`
	"LG-391" `Many Hai and humans have gone missing over the past few decades. Many of the ones who have subsequently been rescued have had mild cadmium poisoning from some technology not of human or Hai origin. Teeneep, a Hai social leader, is using her network of information-gatherers to find out what's going on. Heading to the Quarg south of Hai space to begin the search.`
	"LG-392" `Teeneep doubts the Hai government would arm pirates, but she claims to be able to shut down any such operation, if she has solid evidence.`
	"LG-393" `Alondo asked me to check out the Hai spaceports in various systems near the wormhole, to see if anything unexpected is happening.`
	"LG-394" `Took Teeneep to Hai-home so she can research other deals between the Elders and pirates.`
	"LG-395" `Turns out Terry is not the secretary of Samuel Remington, but has been relegated to that position by a change in management. She was in fact the Chief Operations Officer, or COO; one of the most important people in the Syndicate before the war ended. She is now managing the organizational side of the movie production very competently.`
	"LG-396" `An entrepreneur with a sharp mind, he was drawn into the cover story in the instrumental role of providing the funding, at least officially, for the movie production. It was not clear if he expected to profit from it, or simply saw it as an incomparable experience.`
	"LG-397" `Giti is a research librarian on Earth that specializes in the history of space flight and related archaic topics.`
	"LG-398" `A clandestine organization that existed within the Syndicate that was founded upon anarcho-syndicalist ideals. Its ranks eventually became bloated by enthusiastic recruits from Freedom that were keen to get rich, and were more anarchist than anarcho-syndicalist. The resulting tensions undermined the group, and the Syndicate Internal Affairs scoured them from the organization.`
	"LG-399" `An internal police force within the Syndicate that enforces the Syndicate's laws.`
	"LG-400" `Giti identified the angry cat symbol. It is from a long-defunct subversive group within the Syndicate called Base Principles. Somehow they obtained alien technology, and used the knowledge gained from it to advance their influence within the organization. A half-century ago, Syndicate Internal Affairs scoured them from the Syndicate's ranks in an extremely thorough and prejudiced inquisition.`
	"LG-401" `A group of Hai Elders agreed to change their approach to the problem of pirates if the situation deteriorates further. Unfortunately, they refused to even discuss the disappearances.`
	"LG-402" `Traveled to Unfettered Hai space with Teeneep and convinced them to throw their support behind her.`
	"LG-403" `Teeneep has been rejected by the Elders again, but has set in a motion a plan which has triggered an election instead. This snap election has closed the border and risked creating a diplomatic incident.`
	"LG-404" `An Elder of advanced age and poor eyesight. He is the "master navigator" of the Hai political system, being the first to improve on a system in several generations. He commands widespread respect and possesses enormous clout in the Council of Elders.`
	"LG-405" `Alerted Turner and Danforth to the situation. Been sent back to <planet> to ensure the safety of the diplomats.`
	"LG-406" `The Hai have threatened the Republic if suitable action isn't taken. Required to escort civilians out of the possible danger zone.`
	"LG-407" `Teeneep has recommended that nobody visits Unfettered space while their leader is here with the fleet.`
	"LG-408" `Goraz is a communications researcher from Lovelace Labs. His wife went missing some time ago, and he hopes his research will lead to her rescue.`
	"LG-409" `Some pirate or merchant ships (identified by the computer as "Smuggler") are identifiable by an odd frequency variance in their relay signatures. They are probably involved in kidnapping human or Hai specialists.`
	"LG-410" `Goraz Zoltof has installed a program allowing you to check the logs of hyperspace relay stations to identify possible smuggling ships involved in the kidnappings you're investigating. The data he has acquired with his limited resources only indicates coreward parts of Syndicate space, but your other data suggests comparable evidence might be found in the Far North.`
	"LG-411" `A doomed Hai in a smuggler's vessel yelled "0.184 steradians" as their last words. That could be an unusual hyperspace aperture size, so it may be useful information for Giti to find Devil-Run.`
	"LG-412" `Have been placed under investigation by Syndicate Internal Affairs alongside Giti after she tripped an alert. Ordered to go directly to Hephaestus.`
	"LG-413" `A Republic Intelligence officer who intercepted your investigation with Giti before involving you with Syndicate Internal Affairs. From her unprompted knowledge of his first name, it seems this may not have been her first run-in with the law.`
	"LG-414" `The top police force of the Republic, who deal with high-profile civilian crimes that local authorities can't handle: murder investigations, interplanetary kidnappings, and the like. They also gather intelligence throughout human space, and possibly beyond, reporting directly to the Republic Parliament... which mostly means it's beholden to the interests of the members of Parliament.`
	"LG-415" `Deputy Director Moray works for Syndicate Internal Affairs dealing with pirate-related matters. In addition to enforcing the law, he also smuggles slaves from pirate worlds into freedom in Syndicate space. He claims to be an ally in this investigation and has provided equipment to further the goal.`
	"LG-416" `You've been told to take Giti and some scanning equipment to the unexplored region beyond the Syndicate wormhole to seek a base of operations and bring back information.`
	"LG-417" `Found a bizarre planet with a subterranean colony in its moon. The planet defies analysis and seems to violate the known laws of physics. There is enough evidence of Hai tech to assume Hai presence in addition to the humans able to be detected. However, the scanners could not see the full extent of what's there due to interference from the planet.`
	"LG-418" `While Syndicate Internal Affairs looks over the scan data, it is time to report to Teeneep again.`
	"LG-419" `Formerly a pirate stronghold, this city built by generations of kidnapped specialists is a hundred twenty years old now. Humans, Hai, and even Korath live peacefully, working side-by-side, and most have no desire to leave. They value their independence and have refused Republic membership. This city orbits a strange world that defies analysis in a region of space untouched by civilization.`
	"LG-420" `Liberated Elenchus.`
	"LG-421" `Returned the Hai to their own space to bring an end to the missing Hai saga. Choot'k tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit Teeneep to the Unfettered. They spoke of a future peaceful unification of the Hai, though differ on the specifics despite their closeness. There is one last trip to do for official matters.`
	"LG-422" `The Free Worlds, Republic, and Hai Elders have signed a resolution to ensure safe passage for Hai in human space, on the condition that they register with a customs authority on Mountaintop. Any Hai sent against their will into human space will be recovered alive if possible, regardless of the risk to human soldiers. However, human authorities will not change their approach towards regular human pirates and slavery, citing "unsustainable loss of life."`
	"LG-423" `Have learned that during the crisis a single ship loaded with kidnapped Hai was misplaced and abandoned. They require rescue and may indicate the presence of a loose end.`
	"LG-424" `Recovered Hai after mysterious circumstances left them on Sunracer. Heading to Freedom to follow up on a hunch about this loose end. Will hopefully find answers there.`
	"LG-425" `Confirmed the loose end is Terry. Discovered the existence of another system in the Far North only accessible via jump drive.`
	"LG-426" `Hunted down Terry on Aspiration and confronted her about the events that led you there. The remnants of the anarcho-syndicalist, anti-Syndicate organization called Base Principles were associated with this planet. There are no other actual individuals here that were involved (at least, not anymore), but this community was built in isolation with people who believed in the principles of anarcho-syndicalism. Allowed her to live, but nevertheless this loose end is thoroughly tied up.`
	"LG-427" `During the Hai-human crisis, Terry was arrested when it seemed like war might break out, but was released when the threat of conflict ended. She immediately vanished and was later identified in association with some lingering kidnappers. It is unclear what happened to them, but it is implied that she dealt with them in some way. It turned out that she had been a lone operative infiltrating the Syndicate for many years, with the goal of seizing control and rebuilding the government to be less corrupt, but she condoned kidnapping and exploitation to achieve it. With her life in ruins, she continues to live on the world of Aspiration, far from civilization.`
	"LG-428" `Hunted down Terry on Aspiration and confronted her about the events that led you there. The remnants of the anarcho-syndicalist, anti-Syndicate organization called Base Principles were associated with this planet. There are no other actual individuals here that were involved (at least, not anymore), but this community was built in isolation with people who believed in the principles of anarcho-syndicalism. Chose to end her life. This loose end is thoroughly tied up.`
	"LG-429" `During the Hai-human crisis, Terry was arrested when it seemed like war might break out, but was released when the threat of conflict ended. She immediately vanished and was later identified in association with some lingering kidnappers. It is unclear what happened to them, but it is implied that she dealt with them in some way. It turned out that she had been a lone operative infiltrating the Syndicate for many years, with the goal of seizing control and rebuilding the government to be less corrupt, but she condoned kidnapping and exploitation to achieve it. Her story ended on the bluffs of Aspiration, though no one may ever know it.`
	"LG-430" `The Unfettered Hai say that a dragon-like species called the "Sheragi" who are long extinct used to live in human space, back when much of what is now human territory was occupied by the Hai.`
	"LG-431" `An Unfettered warrior that knows how to handle a blade. Was tested by her before being given access to new Unfettered weapons. Would have been a goner had she not been holding back.`
	"LG-432" `Accepted a somewhat shady deal for an old Hai ship called an Anomalocaris. It seems to still be in a good enough state to fly.`
	"LG-433" `Delivered a pressing food shipment to the Unfettered Hai using the Anomalocaris, which seems to have pleased them.`
	"LG-434" `Managed to use an ancient Hai warship to beat an Unfettered challenger, earning respect with the Unfettered Hai so long as the ship remains in my possession.`
	"LG-435" `Entered a region of space northeast of the Hai and was warned by a disembodied voice to not disturb the "unborn flowers" that inhabit the region.`
	"LG-436" `Entered a region of space northeast of the Hai and was warned by a disembodied voice to not disturb the "unborn flowers" that inhabit the region. Agreed to stay away from there.`
	"LG-437" `Assisted a stranded alien vessel in an uninhabited system whose crew members appeared similar to floating octopi or jellyfish. Could not communicate with them due to the language barrier, but managed to give them the equipment they needed to repair their ship. Unfortunately, they lacked a hyperdrive and so were unable to travel back to their home system.`
	"LG-438" `Discovered that the species to the northeast of Hai space, the Incipias, are under the protection of the Quarg. Was given a translator by a Quarg in order to assist a stranded Incipias ship, but was warned not to give the Incipias any advanced technology or interfere in their development.`
	"LG-439" `Met with the Incipias on their space station, and gained access to their ships, which are capable of entering the gas giant that the stranded Incipias ship has taken refuge in.`
	"LG-440" `The Incipias are a species of aliens that live to the northeast of Hai space. They originated from a gas giant, and resemble large, floating octopi. As they have not yet developed the hyperdrive, they are confined to a single system and are under the protection of the Quarg.`
	"LG-441" `Noticed an alert on <ship>'s dashboard about minor data corruption. The following log entry was recovered, but the original timestamp was lost.`
	"LG-442" `The Incipias seem to be split into two groups called the Hicemus and the Conlatio; the former occupies a space station, while the latter occupies the Incipias homeworld. The Conlatio do not appear to allow outsiders on their home planet.`
	"LG-443" `Successfully boarded an Aberrant. A strange presence seemed to watch during the investigation, one that gave a sense of foreboding. It appears to be a single, ship-sized organism that can travel in space using a special exoskeleton.`
	"LG-444" `Successfully boarded an Aberrant. It appears to strongly resemble a Ka'het, yet one that has been twisted into a new form, one that feels fundamentally wrong.`
	"LG-445" `Successfully boarded a Ka'het. It appears to be a single, ship-sized organism that can travel in space using a special exoskeleton.`
	"LG-446" `Successfully boarded a Ka'het. Like the Aberrant, it appears to be a single, ship-sized organism that can travel in space using a special exoskeleton, but does not seem to induce the same ominous feeling.`
	"LG-447" `Asked Taely about the Graveyard and the Ka'het and learned of the Remnant's previous contacts between them.`
	"LG-448" `The Ka'het are a species which live in the Graveyard, an area south of the Ember Waste. They are large lifeforms which can travel in space using artificial exoskeletons and will attack anyone on sight, even other Ka'het.`
	"LG-449" `The Builders inhabited the Graveyard millennia ago, but have since become extinct. They developed some sort of weapon, called the "Ka'het," which stopped obeying their orders and rebelled against them.`
	"LG-450" `According to the Quarg, the Ka'het were initially a weapon created by the Builders, which then rebelled and led them to extinction. Even in the millennia that passed, they are still being produced in the Graveyard.`
	"LG-451" `Asked the Quarg about the history of the Graveyard, and have learned about the previous inhabitants of the region, the Builders.`
	"LG-452" `Captured an active Builder satellite. It was a warning beacon orbiting the moon Alix, which appears to have been used as a quarantine site to defend against an alien plague.`
	"LG-453" `The Korath are reptilian, bipedal aliens whose territory is almost entirely in ruins: cities destroyed and entire planets scarred by what appears to have been a vicious civil war. Several factions of Korath survive. The "Kor Efreti" live in the shelter of a Quarg ringworld and are on peaceful terms with the Quarg. Other Korath, living as exiles near the galactic core, have been raiding human worlds to steal food and supplies. And deeper in Korath space, two massive armies of automated war drones, known as the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor, are locked in an unending struggle. They attack any visitors to their region of space, including the Quarg.`
	"LG-454" `The Quarg are tall, thin, inscrutable aliens who evolved on a very small planet and can live comfortably on worlds with atmosphere so thin that a human being could not breathe it. They discovered spaceflight millions of years ago. Many of them live on artificially constructed ringworlds, including one in human space. They live at peace with most sentient species and claim to be in communication with an even older species named the Drak.`
	"LG-455" `The Drak are supposedly the oldest living species in the galaxy. The Quarg say that the Drak act as something like galactic peacekeepers or police, and will intervene if a species invents a weapon so terrible that it could drive that species to extinction.`
	"LG-456" `Full name Gohl Salyi Memt-Wrik Laz. It is an old, odd Quarg that is more open than its species tends to be in answering questions about rather sensitive topics.`
	"LG-457" `Discovered a strange, isolated human community in an otherwise uninhabited region of space south of the Core. Angered them by refusing to submit to some sort of blood test.`
	"LG-458" `The Remnant are a group of unusual-looking humans that live in a secluded section of the galaxy. It is unclear how long they have lived apart from the rest of humanity, but they have been free of human influences for long enough that their culture is wildly different from any found in human record. Their buildings seem to be alien in origin, and they communicate amongst each other primarily with sign language. When they do use their voices they sing or chant, rather than speak.`
	"LG-459" `Discovered a strange, isolated human community in an otherwise uninhabited region of space south of the Core. They call themselves the Remnant.`
	"LG-460" `Half a millennium ago, during the Alpha Wars, a group of humans fleeing the conflict and looking for a safer place to live discovered a wormhole into a region of space known as the Ember Waste. They built settlements there, and chose to call themselves the Remnant. Although they no longer fear the Alphas as much as they once did, they still have not rejoined human society.`
	"LG-461" `Since their colonies were first formed, the Remnant's culture has changed drastically. They communicate in sign language, using their voices only for singing. Their food and architecture and much of their technology is strange, and much of it has been borrowed or stolen from nearby alien species.`
	"LG-462" `Became stuck in the Ember Waste, but was given a Quantum Key Stone by an old woman who claims to have once been stuck in Republic space under similar circumstances.`
	"LG-463" `Recently, Korath ships have begun raiding Remnant worlds. The Remnant have decided not to try to discourage these raids, because they are a perfect opportunity to steal jump drives and other valuable alien technology from the Korath.`
	"LG-464" `The "void sprites" are space-dwelling lifeforms. They are apparently not sentient. They evolved in the atmosphere of a gas giant, but have some biological mechanism for altering or reflecting gravity that allows them to fly into outer space, in the same way that human ships use antigravity to escape a planet's gravity well. The void sprites are not particularly powerful or dangerous creatures, but they are guarded by a Drak Archon.`
	"LG-465" `Archons are partly biological, but do not seem to be naturally evolved creatures. Some of their biological characteristics may have been based on the "void sprites" that inhabit the Ember Waste.`
	"LG-466" `The prefects have reached a consensus: now considered a valuable friend of the Remnant, and given permission to purchase their ships and technology.`
	"LG-467" `Have been introduced to the basics of the Remnant sign language. Will need to practice using the video lessons for some time in order to fully understand Remnant sign language.`
	"LG-468" `Have achieved a degree of fluency in the Remnant sign language sufficient for general conversation.`
	"LG-469" `As an engineering prefect, Taely is the foremost authority among the Remnant on salvaged technology and a senior leader in their reverse engineering program.`
	"LG-470" `One of Taely's main priorities is improving the maneuverability characteristics of Remnant ships. To this end she has been working on building a new prototype ship based on the void sprites.`
	"LG-471" `As a military prefect, Chilia is responsible for the defense of Remnant space. He can usually be found on the front lines of combat unless required to work on tactics for the Remnant as a whole.`
	"LG-472" `Despite being quite young, Chilia is highly respected among Remnant society.`
	"LG-473" `Prefect Chilia is an unusual person compared to most military leaders: He is inclined to do things himself and rarely stands on protocol.`
	"LG-474" `A Remnant researcher specializing in xenobiology, Plume is at the forefront of recent efforts to restart research on the void sprites and a leading expert in non-carbon based lifeforms.`
	"LG-475" `Dawn is a young Remnant researcher with a strong interest in engineering. She has yet to pick a specialty, but appears to have a talent for exo-engineering.`
	"LG-476" `Volunteered to show Dawn and some of her fellow researchers the world where humans and Quarg co-exist.`
	"LG-477" `As an outfitter, Aeolus is responsible for managing the logistics that supply the Remnant with materials, equipment, and resources. In contrast to outfitters in what the Remnant term "ancestral space," he is focused on ensuring the efficient optimization of Remnant ships, not making a profit.`
	"LG-478" `A technician that works with Plume, and a talented astrobiologist. Gavriil is the project lead for the repurposed Esquiline station.`
	"LG-479" `Successfully introduced a flock of void sprites to Esquiline. Time will tell how they fare.`
	"LG-480" `The Rulei were likely an ancient, technologically advanced civilization from long ago, but the only things that remain of them are a single strange ship and two scarred planets.`
	"LG-481" `They communicate through some sort of invasive psionic ability, speaking in a thousand voices all at once. Prolonged contact seems unhealthy.`
	"LG-482" `Discovered a region of emptiness east of the core, where systems are shrouded by a vast, eerie darkness. Other than dim stars and a few planets, nothing exists.`
	"LG-483" `The Rulei seem to acknowledge the void of systems east of the core as the "Umbral Reach", and appear to have some sort of emotional connection to the region. Other than stating to "beware" the area, they will not further comment on it.`
	"LG-484" `Agreed to take a piece of wood from a church on Midgard for an archaeologist. Carbon dating suggests that the church was built many centuries before the discovery of the hyperdrive.`
	"LG-485" `An archaeologist who is famous for using dubious methods: he has been banned from Quarg space for trying to collect an alloy sample from their ringworld, and is rumored to have also been involved in a scheme involving dinosaur fossils and an illegal genetic resequencer. He is currently based on Vinci, on the edge of the Paradise sector.`
	"LG-486" `Returned to Midgard with Albert Foster, the archaeologist, to map the area around the church. The instruments discovered what looked like an artificial singularity. Got chased away by Deep ships before being able to look closer.`
	"LG-487" `Experienced a strange vision while drifting in the Ildaria system that looked like the fall of a civilization of dragon-people. The terrain on the planet of Zug looks strikingly similar to this vision.`
	"LG-488" `Found the archaeologist Albert Foster and told him about the vision of the dragon-people on Zug. Foster suggested that the vision was the doing of an Archon. He discovered a buried city under the lava flows on Zug; perhaps the vision was a real view of the past.`
	"LG-489" `With the help of a Quarg ship, fought off a group of antique thieves looking to rob the archaeological site that Albert Foster dug up. Foster will need some time to study what he has found and release the results of his findings.`
	"LG-490" `Recent archaeological discoveries on Zug, a planet in the southern rim of human space, have turned up evidence of a lost alien civilization. The Quarg say that the ruins were left behind by a species called the Sheragi.`
	"LG-491" `Took a mysterious Sheragi data cube that Albert Foster dug up on Zug to a trusted friend on Vinci. John will take some time to see how exactly it works, and send a message when it's done.`
	"LG-492" `A brilliant Hai xenoprogramming expert, Desyo specializes in Sheragi code and software. She is more interested in technology and electronics than people and often coordinates the work in the Hai archaeologist team, despite her introversion and lack of hierarchy. Her dedication is the grease that keeps that machine running.`
	"LG-493" `Rakei is an engineering expert specializing in archaeological artifacts, but also very interested in new and unusual technology, often nerding out with Desyo over the latest scientific papers. She is part of the Hai archaeologist team tasked to uncover the mystery of the Sheragi black box.`
	"LG-494" `Uncaring about formalities and seriousness, you wouldn't guess Eyama is an accomplished linguist specializing in Sheragi language. She also has an interest in culture and sociology in general, and has a lot more knowledge about human culture than you would expect from a Hai, or even most humans. Her work with the Hai archaeologist team is invaluable to deciphering Sheragi mysteries and maintaining their relationship with human partners.`
	"LG-495" `Obtained an ancient Sheragi warship whose name translates to the Emerald Sword. It was crewed by mutineers that fled from their civil war and escaped into interstellar space. Found orbiting a disconnected star, it is an impressively large ship, fit for the equally large Sheragi. The ship's main weapon is a fusion-pumped gamma-ray laser called the 'Dragonflame Cannon.' Despite the relatively primitive outfits, it's still a very capable war machine due to its size.`
	"LG-496" `Made contact with a group of aliens to the far south of the Graveyard. Took a device from them which marked a system a couple of jumps the east.`
	"LG-497" `Made contact with a group of aliens to the far south of the Graveyard. Refused to take a device from them and was forced to return to orbit.`
	"LG-498" `Made contact with a group of aliens to the far south of the Graveyard calling themselves "the Successors." Was instructed to return to Staja-Kella-Oa in eight days, when their government will decide what to do about my arrival.`
	"LG-499" `The Successors are a society of aliens occupying a territory on the southeastern outer rim of the galaxy; amphibious octopods approximately three meters tall. They are governed by their High Houses, institutions built around several noble families whose scions wield political and military power. They have not encountered humans for 1500 years, at which time their Predecessors were exploring much of the galaxy.`
	"LG-500" `Sieasej is a Successor scholar of historical linguistics and a member of the noble House Sioeora. Because of their area of study, they are one of the only Successors who can speak to and understand human language without the benefit of a translation device.`
	"LG-501" `Met with the leaders of the Successor High House Sioeora and was instructed to retrieve an animal from the planet Raaqa-Uur-Kaav. Was promised translation equipment as a reward. Accepted their offer.`
	"LG-502" `Met with the leaders of the Successor High House Sioeora and was instructed to retrieve an animal from the planet Raaqa-Uur-Kaav. Was promised translation equipment as a reward. Rejected.`
	"LG-503" `Released the animal House Sioeora requested I bring to them. Returned their citizen, but was barred from further dealings with the House.`
	"LG-504" `Captured and returned the animal House Sioeora requested that I bring to them. Was rewarded with a translation device and historical data that allows me to land on most Successor worlds. Was told that assisting in jobs and missions for the Successors would eventually allow me to purchase some of their technology.`
	"LG-505" `Saajret, of Somber Sejra is an archivist, among other things, for the Successor High House Kaatrij. They are a member of the noble lineage of the now-defunct House Sejra, some of whose citizens were absorbed into House Kaatrij during the partial collapse of their Predecessors' society.`
	"LG-506" `Summoned by the Successor High House Kaatrij to their homeworld, where it was explained that they are the ancestral keepers of the animals that I refused to capture for House Sioeora. Was rewarded for keeping the animals from Sioeora with a translation device and cultural data, which open up many of the Successors' worlds to me. Was told that assisting in jobs and missions for the Successors would eventually allow me to purchase some of their technology.`
	"LG-507" `Summoned to meet with the Successor High Houses in council and given the right to purchase their civilian technology.`
	"LG-508" `The High Houses are organized into two large alliances called the Old and New Houses, which have historically been in tension with each other. The Houses cooperate in council with their allies and the other Houses in general.`
	"LG-509" `The "Eye" wormhole has opened in Wanderer space, but the territory on the other side of the wormhole is Korath space, ravaged by their civil war and still infested with autonomous war machines. Nonetheless, the Wanderers are excited to once again begin their work of healing and repairing damaged worlds.`
	"LG-510" `Tele'ek became part of the expeditionary force that was formed to explore the territory beyond the Eye once it opened.`
	"LG-511" `Iriket is a Wanderer specializing in terraforming, who has been selected to survey the worlds beyond the Eye and to make plans for how each one can be made to flourish once more. She is far more interested in the terraforming work than in dealing with the threat of the Korath war machines.`
	"LG-512" `Archons are partly biological, partly technological, and partly something that human language has no words for. They are extremely powerful. The Archons are somehow affiliated with the Drak, yet separate from them.`
	"LG-513" `Discovered that the "Kor Mereti" drone ships are controlled by some sort of collective and decentralized artificial intelligence, with no obvious weaknesses.`
	"LG-514" `The "Kor Sestor" drones turn out to all be controlled remotely, presumably by either an artificial intelligence or by Korath leaders in hiding on one of their worlds. If the control center could be found, it would be possible to gain control of the entire Kor Sestor fleet.`
	"LG-515" `Iktat Rek has survived the Molt, but in a completely new form. Rek is now female, and is only the size of a Wanderer child, and has chosen the name "Ektasi Rek" for herself, meaning something like "communicator" or "bridge-builder."`
	"LG-516" `Rek underwent the Molt, a mysterious process in which the body of a Wanderer who is exposed to novel stimuli transforms into a completely new species while still maintaining that individual's memories and personality. The new Rek is a female and goes by the name "Ektasi Rek."`
	"LG-517" `Ektasi Rek is the first Wanderer in millennia to undergo the Molt, changing into a completely different species with new capabilities. As more Wanderers go through the Molt, the Wanderers as a whole will have to decide which of these mutations represents the best way for their species to survive and flourish in Korath space.`
	"LG-518" `Rek's metamorphosis seems to have given her enhanced ability to understand other languages. She will be staying with the friendly Korath for a while in order to learn how to communicate with them.`
	"LG-519" `Rek's Molt has given her enhanced ability not only to understand alien speech, but to mimic the sound of it as well.`
	"LG-520" `The Quarg (or possibly, a faction within the Quarg, or even just a group of Quarg acting on their own) have agreed to send three of their warships to help defend the Wanderer settlement in Korath space. (Or maybe they are sending the ships because they view the Wanderers as invaders and want to keep an eye on them. It is not easy to determine their true intentions.)`
	"LG-521" `According to the Quarg, the Wanderers are not native to this galaxy, but were brought here from somewhere else (presumably by the Pug).`
	"LG-522" `Visited the Pug to see if they are willing to help the Wanderers fight the Korath automata. But the Pug and the Quarg do not get along with each other, and therefore the Pug are not willing to enter Korath space.`
	"LG-523" `For reasons that are not entirely clear, the Pug are hostile toward the Archons, yet also view them as being worthy of pity.`
	"LG-524" `The Pug say that their species is split up into separate groups or "teams" that each focus on interacting with a different sentient species. They view those other species as "projects" that they are working on.`
	"LG-525" `The Wanderers think that it might be possible to infect the Kor Mereti communications network with something akin to a computer virus, to either take control of the drones or disable them entirely.`
	"LG-526" `Helped to defend one of the friendly Korath worlds from an attack by Kor Mereti drones. There are Korath scientists on that world who have been working for decades to find a way to hack into the Kor Mereti network, but they do not think it is possible.`
	"LG-527" `When the Korath civil war reached a point where they had nearly driven themselves extinct, the Drak Archons stepped in and offered the surviving Korath an ultimatum: they must either give up their advanced weaponry and live peaceably under the protection of the Quarg, or be banished to some lifeless star systems near the galactic core. Those who chose banishment apparently took with them the secret of how to build jump drives, which has enabled them to raid other species and steal from them.`
	"LG-528" `Tested a device that the Wanderers thought would be able to force itself into the Kor Mereti network and take control of it. The experiment completely failed, however.`
	"LG-529" `The Wanderers have a new plan: to try to either subvert or possibly even befriend the Kor Mereti network by connecting it to a powerful Wanderer artificial intelligence.`
	"LG-530" `Pa'aret runs a Wanderer artificial intelligence laboratory. He is in charge of the effort to establish a connection between the Wanderers and the Kor Mereti collective by introducing a Wanderer "artificial Mind" into the collective.`
	"LG-531" `The Wanderers want to install one of their artificial Minds on a space station controlled by the Kor Mereti. Their theory is that if the Mind is physically located within a Kor Mereti station, the drones will be much more likely to accept it as part of their own network instead of reacting to it as an outside intruder.`
	"LG-532" `The Wanderer ploy has succeeded, but with an unexpected result. The Kor Mereti drones have so thoroughly absorbed the Wanderer Mind into their own consciousness that the drones now believe that they themselves are Wanderers.`
	"LG-533" `The Wanderers have come to believe that prior to the introduction of their Mind, the Kor Mereti network was not actually a self-aware entity, but that it has now become a sentient being in its own right. And, it is apparently a sentient being with a deep interest in gardening.`
	"LG-534" `Brought a group of Wanderer mentors and teachers to one of the Kor Mereti worlds, where they will seek to build a relationship with the drones and to help them learn to care for living things and to join in the Wanderer work of healing devastated planets.`
	"LG-535" `Leading some of the friendly Korath on a tour through Wanderer space, to show them how successful the Wanderers have been at repairing and caring for worlds that have been damaged by war.`
	"LG-536" `Agreed to travel through Kor Sestor space, scanning the planets to try to look for the facility that is remotely controlling the Kor Sestor drones.`
	"LG-537" `Someone else seems to have located the Kor Sestor central command before the Wanderers did, and has taken control of the Kor Sestor fleet. Most of the Kor Sestor drones flew through the Eye into the old Wanderer territory, where the Wanderers will probably not be prepared to fight them.`
	"LG-538" `The Kor Sestor fleet has somehow made its way into northern human space, perhaps using a small number of jump drives to ferry ships back and forth the same way that the Unfettered invaders did. Admiral Danforth says that the system where the Korath ships have gathered is home to a secret Alpha base, so he is concerned that the Kor Sestor drones are under Alpha control.`
	"LG-539" `Recruited some Quarg warships to help defend human space from the Kor Sestor drones, which are now presumably under Alpha control.`
	"LG-540" `Danforth believes that he has located the Alpha base from which the drones are being controlled; if the base is destroyed the drones ought to become aimless and be easily defeated.`
	"LG-541" `Dropped some sort of incredibly destructive bomb on the Alpha base on the anarchist world of Zenith. The explosion tore open a hole straight through the planet's crust.`
	"LG-542" `Succeeded in destroying the last of the Kor Sestor drones that the Alphas brought into human space. Danforth and his Navy base also survived, but he is worried about the political fallout of having to use such a destructive weapon on a populated planet in order to eliminate the Alphas.`
	"LG-543" `Succeeded in destroying the Kor Sestor fleet and eliminating the Alpha base on the anarchist world of Zenith. He is very grateful that the bomb or super-weapon, whatever it was, did not need to be used.`
	"LG-544" `The Kor Sestor drones are still being produced by an automated factory, even though no one is controlling them and they seem to be acting on some sort of mindless autopilot. The Wanderers hope that the Korath exiles will help them to disable the factory.`
	"LG-545" `Succeeded in communicating with the Korath exiles, by landing on the one habitable planet in their territory. (It seems like the exiles might have a taboo against using weapons on that world.) The exiles agreed to send some ships to help disable the remaining Kor Sestor factory.`
	"LG-546" `The Korath exiles have kept their bargain with the Wanderers and shut down the final Kor Sestor drone factory, although it may be some time before the last of the existing drones are eliminated.`
	"LG-547" `Discovered that when the Korath exiles shut down the Kor Sestor factory, they also took enough technology from the factory to be able to begin producing war drones of their own. It is possible that the exiles have just become a whole lot more dangerous than they used to be.`
	"LG-548" `After the Eye opened, creating a wormhole link between Wanderer territory and the region of space that harbors the devastated Korath worlds, the Wanderers have established several new colonies in the Korath sector and have begun to migrate to this area of Space. They have established formal relations with the Kor Efreti and were able to end the war between the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor.`
	"LG-549" `The Wanderers, who have begun to establish colonies on some deserted Korath systems, were able to end the war between the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor. The Kor Efreti have begun to rebuild their worlds and are tutored in this endeavor by the Wanderers.`
	"LG-550" `Discovered a birdlike alien species to the north of human space. They appear to speak the Hai language in addition to their own, so with the help of a Hai interpreter it might be possible to communicate with them.`
	"LG-551" `Ambassador Sayari, a Hai, served as their envoy to the human government a century ago (although no public records of this exist in human space). She has now been assigned by the Hai to be their diplomat to the Wanderers, and to serve as a translator as well.`
	"LG-552" `Was able to communicate with the birdlike "Wanderers" with the help of a Hai ambassador. It turns out that they have been under attack by the Unfettered Hai for some time, and have learned the Hai language by taking captives.`
	"LG-553" `The Wanderers are a bird-like species who inhabit a small region of space adjacent to the Hai. They have been under attack by the "Unfettered" Hai for some time. The Wanderers claim to be peaceful, and most of their ships are not designed for military use.`
	"LG-554" `Received a device, created by a Hai scientist, which can translate between human language and the Hai language. Since the Wanderers speak the Hai language, that should make it possible to communicate with them directly.`
	"LG-555" `Spoke with a Wanderer ambassador named Iktat Rek, using the translation device. Received permission to purchase some of their technology, but not their ships.`
	"LG-556" `The Wanderers believe that their purpose in the universe is to "repair" planets whose biospheres have been ravaged by other species either through mismanagement or as a result of war. They came to their current territory through a wormhole that they call "the Eye," and they say that once their work here is done the Eye will open and lead them to a new territory and new worlds for them to care for.`
	"LG-557" `It is possible that the worlds they currently inhabit were formerly part of Hai territory. That might explain why the Unfettered believe they have a right to take that territory back.`
	"LG-558" `Rek is a Wanderer ambassador, a new and unusual profession among a species that until recently has had no contact with aliens except for the occasional Unfettered Hai raid. His job is to help the Wanderers develop a deeper relationship with humans.`
	"LG-559" `There is a Pug world close to Wanderer space. Given their ability to control wormholes, it is likely that they are the ones who have been controlling where the Wanderers go and when. But, the Wanderers are not particularly disturbed by this information.`
	"LG-560" `Helped to defend a Wanderer world against a raid by Unfettered Hai ships.`
	"LG-561" `Volunteered to help bring a shipment of food to the Unfettered, as "tribute" from the Wanderers, in the hope that it will placate the Unfettered into making peace.`
	"LG-562" `Managed to broker a temporary ceasefire between the Unfettered Hai and the Wanderers. Was granted access to purchase the non-military Wanderer ships, as a reward.`
	"LG-563" `Agreed to try to sell a jump drive to the Unfettered Hai, as a way to get more information from them about who else is providing them with jump drives and enabling their attacks on the Wanderers.`
	"LG-564" `Learned from the Unfettered Hai that they have been purchasing jump drives from the Alphas (whom they refer to as "unfettered humans").`
	"LG-565" `Planted some surveillance devices, designed by the Wanderers, in Unfettered Hai space. A month from now, they will be done collecting data on ship movements in the area, and may provide a hint of where the Alphas who are selling jump drives to the Unfettered are coming from.`
	"LG-566" `The Pug in Wanderer space are not interested in helping the Wanderers to fight the Alphas. They say that interfering in Hai and human affairs is beyond their "jurisdiction."`
	"LG-567" `Met a human named Elias Hanover who is friends with the Quarg and who has been given permission to use Quarg technology to track the Alpha ship that is selling jump drives to the Unfettered.`
	"LG-568" `Elias has been living with the Quarg in Hai space for a long time, and they trust him enough to give him access to some of their restricted technology.`
	"LG-569" `Defeated a Navy Carrier, presumably being operated by the Alphas, that was equipped with Korath fighters and drones. Presumably there is an Alpha base hidden somewhere on the earth-like planet that the Carrier was guarding.`
	"LG-570" `Admiral Danforth agreed to bring his Cruiser to the planet in Korath space where the Alphas seem to be hiding, with enough troops and equipment to launch an assault on the base.`
	"LG-571" `However, the true reason that the powerful Oathkeeper fleet is positioned in the North is not just to keep the pirates at bay, but also to stand as a last defense in case the Hai decide to invade human space. Apparently the Navy has known about the Hai and the wormhole linking their space to human space for some time, but chooses not to make that knowledge public.`
	"LG-572" `The Alphas have fled from the base on Avalon. The Oathkeepers destroyed what is left of the base, which will hopefully set the Alphas back quite a bit.`
	"LG-573" `Was taken captive, along with Elias Hanover, by some nameless Republic officers who thought Elias was an Alpha. They discovered that he is not one, although he appears to have some of the same genetically engineered advantages that the Alphas have.`
	"LG-574" `Certain Navy officers believe that Elias may actually be more than five centuries old, and that he may be a genetically modified individual, perhaps specifically designed to have capabilities similar to the Alphas so that he can fight against them.`
	"LG-575" `Reported to the Wanderers that the Alphas who had been selling jump drives to the Unfettered have been weakened and driven into hiding. The Wanderers are ramping up production of military ships to try to face the continuing Unfettered onslaught.`
	"LG-576" `The Unfettered have established a beachhead on one of the Wanderer worlds and are now apparently using what few jump drives they possess to shuttle more and more warships into Wanderer space. War has begun in earnest.`
	"LG-577" `Helped to evacuate some Wanderers from one of their worlds that is closest to Unfettered space.`
	"LG-578" `Tele'ek is a Wanderer military commander. It is not clear what his rank is or whether or not the Wanderer military is even organized enough for individuals to have ranks, but he has been placed in charge of holding back the Hai while the remaining Wanderer worlds near the front are evacuated.`
	"LG-579" `Helped to defend a Wanderer planet from an Unfettered attack. But, the Wanderers now plan to abandon that planet. The Wanderers seem very hesitant to actually stand their ground and fight back.`
	"LG-580" `Visited the Pug planet adjacent to Wanderer space to see if they are willing to step in and help the Wanderers now that the Unfettered Hai pose such a threat and have captured several Wanderer worlds. But for whatever reason, the Pug insist on the Wanderers fighting for themselves.`
	"LG-581" `Traveled to the Hai homeworld with Ambassador Sayari to see if she can convince the Hai to take action to restrain the Unfettered from attacking the Wanderers. The most that the Hai were willing to do was to mass a large war fleet near Unfettered space so that the Unfettered have to divert warships there to defend their home worlds.`
	"LG-582" `The Unfettered are unwilling to agree to even a temporary ceasefire with the Wanderers. They seem to think that they will win this war easily.`
	"LG-583" `Returned to Wanderer space, and discovered that Iktat Rek has begun the "Molt." He is afraid that because the Eye has not yet opened, the Molt will not be viable and it will end up killing him.`
	"LG-584" `Received permission to purchase warships from the Wanderers, including a new one called the Tempest.`
	"LG-585" `Helped to defend a Wanderer world from yet another Unfettered attack. Meanwhile, the Wanderers are trying to move as many civilians as possible back to their home world, where they will be safe.

	"LG-587" `Brought Iktat Rek to a Wanderer hospital facility. His illness, or molt, is progressing, and he has grown much weaker. But his mind is still as sharp as ever, and in fact he has somehow managed to pick up human language just by listening to the words of the translation machine.`
	"LG-588" `Iktat Rek has been placed in protective quarantine in a germ-free room, where he will receive drugs that will suppress his immune system and allow the genetic change that is taking place in his body to be completed. Even if he survives the process, it may change him beyond recognition.`
	"LG-589" `The Wanderers have begun producing even larger warships, and have succeeded in driving off yet another Unfettered assault.

	"LG-590" `After obtaining a sufficient number of jump drives, the Unfettered expanded into Wanderer space and managed to conquer six worlds from the Wanderers before their advance was stopped due to Pug interference.`
