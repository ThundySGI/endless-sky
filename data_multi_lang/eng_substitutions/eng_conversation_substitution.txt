	"CN-0" `As you are approaching the <origin>, your radar sensors detect that the ship you are assisting is about to be slammed by a huge asteroid! While in a normal flight this wouldn't cause much trouble, a ship that has already suffered heavy damage and cannot dodge could be completely destroyed.`
	"CN-1" `	(Shoot the asteroid.)`
	"CN-2" `	(Maneuver my ship to shield the <origin>.)`
	"CN-3" `	(Attempt to repair the <origin> so that it can dodge the asteroid.)`
	"CN-4" `	(Interrupt the docking maneuvers and fly away.)`
	"CN-5" `	You turn your ship around and activate your thrusters, trying to get as far as you can from the disabled ship. A few seconds later, the asteroid collides with the <origin>, tearing it to shreds and killing all of its crew members while leaving little more than a scratch on the asteroid's surface.`
	"CN-6" `	You fire at the asteroid in an attempt to destroy it, but it looks like you've only made things worse. The asteroid has now broken up into dozens of smaller chunks still flying directly for the <origin>. Before you can even react to fix your mistake, most of the chunks have already hit the <origin>, which is now quickly depressurizing. There's nothing more you can do except move a safe distance away from the exploding ship...`
	"CN-7" `	The shots you fire quickly break the asteroid into pieces, which seem to have changed course enough to completely miss the <origin>. After repairing it, you hail its captain, who thanks you with a payment of 30,000 credits.`
	"CN-8" `	You dock with the <origin>, hoping to get out of this alive, but as soon as you reach the hatch, the asteroid hits and a series of explosions start coming from the disabled ship. You are able to reach your cockpit and undock, but the crew on the other ship couldn't reach yours in time...`
	"CN-9" `	You dock with the <origin>, hoping to get out of this alive, but, as soon as you reach the hatch, the asteroid hits and a series of explosions start coming from the disabled ship. Most of the other ship's crew has been able to reach your ship by the time you undock from it, and they ask you to take them to <destination>.`
	"CN-10" `	"Okay, it's not far."`
	"CN-11" `	"How much can you pay me?"`
	"CN-12" `	"I have a few hundred thousand credits," one of them says, presumably the captain. "I need to save enough to buy a new starship, but you will still receive a decent pay."`
	"CN-13" `	The asteroid, after hitting your shield, breaks into a million fragments which fly away from the <origin>. After repairing it, you hail its captain, who thanks you with a payment of 30,000 credits.`
	"CN-14" `When you repair the <origin>, the captain hails you. "This is the fourth time I've nearly died in the past week doing this job! Here, take this <cargo> to <destination> and finish this job for me. They said the payment is <payment>."`
	"CN-15" `	(Take the cargo.)`
	"CN-16" `	(Don't take the cargo.)`
	"CN-17" `	The captain begins loudly swearing, so you cut the feed. Hopefully they make it to their destination in one piece.`
	"CN-18" `The captain of the <origin> thanks you for repairing them, but informs you that the pirates that disabled them are only a smaller part of a fleet attacking <destination>.`
	"CN-19" `	The authorities of <planet> will probably pay you quite well if you assist them, but this could also be an easy way to get yourself killed.`
	"CN-20" `	(Don't join the fight.)`
	"CN-21" `	(Join the defense fleet.)`
	"CN-22" `You make short-range scans of the <origin>'s outfits and cargo. Among the cargo, you find a crate full of credit chips worth <payment>. You drag the crate onto your ship before considering your next move.`
	"CN-23" `You board the <origin>, but find no crew aboard. When you reach the cockpit of the ship, you look out into space to see an escape pod floating away. The <origin> is emitting a distress signal to nearby pirates, and a self-destruct sequence has been activated! You run back to your ship and get ready to fight.`
	"CN-24" `When you board the <origin>, you find most of the crew already dead. One of the surviving crew members, who looks like a teenaged boy no older than 16, approaches you with his hands in the air. He explains that after the ship was disabled, a section of the crew decided to overthrow the tyrannical captain. He continues, saying how most pirate crew members are forced into servitude on pirate ships. The surviving <bunks> crew members beg you to bring them to <destination> so that they can escape from pirate slavery.`
	"CN-25" `	The fight seems to have damaged the ship beyond repair. It may not last much longer in the vacuum of space if you leave the pirates here.`
	"CN-26" `	(Help the pirate crew.)`
	"CN-27" `	(Leave the pirate crew.)`
	"CN-28" `You leave your ship empty and board the <origin> alone. Though you aren't expecting any danger, you still feel apprehensive all by yourself on an unknown disabled vessel, so you make sure to bring a sidearm. Your apprehension rises as you realize you can't hear any sounds of frantic activity or see crew members scurrying around trying to repair damage like you would expect. Making your way to the bridge, you relax upon seeing a single handsome and well-dressed young man welding a bulkhead. His movements are dexterous and competent, but your practiced eye tells you that the bulkhead is damaged beyond repair, so his work is futile. He looks up and introduces himself as captain Tarquin, offering the princely sum of 350,000 credits for your expert help repairing his vessel.`
	"CN-29" `You leave your first mate in charge of your ship and board the <origin> alone. Though you aren't expecting any danger, you still feel apprehensive all by yourself on an unknown disabled vessel, so you make sure to bring a sidearm.

	"CN-30" `As your boarding party clambers aboard the <origin>, you realize you can't hear any sounds of frantic activity or see crew members scurrying around trying to repair damage like you would expect. Making your way to the bridge, you are greeted by a single handsome and well-dressed young man welding a bulkhead. His movements are dexterous and competent, but your practiced eye tells you that the bulkhead is damaged beyond repair, so his work is futile. He looks up and introduces himself as captain Tarquin, offering the princely sum of 350,000 credits for your expert help repairing his vessel.`
	"CN-31" `	(Accept this generous payment and help make repairs.)`
	"CN-32" `	"Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but why are you offering so much money for my assistance?"`
	"CN-33" `	"Can we get some help from your crew?"`
	"CN-34" `	"Shouldn't a ship of this size have more crew?"`
	"CN-35" `	Tarquin laughs self-consciously. "The truth is, I'm a bit desperate," he says. "My cargo hold is full of perishable goods that need to be delivered in three days to a very important client who will probably cut me off if I don't make the deadline. I thought I could save money by hiring inexperienced peasants to crew the ship, but as you can see, that hasn't worked out very well. They're cowering in their quarters even now. I'm offering you my profits from being a cheapskate. We'll call it paying for a lesson learned.`
	"CN-36" `	Tarquin laughs heartily. "That lot? They're a bunch of simple peasants I picked up on New India, off hiding in their quarters right now. The bumpkins are unaccustomed to this kind of danger, and don't have a lot of technical skills. My fault for being too cheap to hire good help, I suppose. I'm definitely going to pick up some more experienced and reliable crewmen after we get out of this mess."`
	"CN-37" `	"Can we get to work now?"`
	"CN-38" `	(Get to work repairing the ship.)`
	"CN-39" `	(Press the matter.)`
	"CN-40" `	Something about captain Tarquin's explanation doesn't sit right with you, so you keep asking questions to distract him while subtly walking towards the ship's crew section. As you get closer, you start to hear the faint sounds of people banging on walls and yelling for help. Tarquin's face displays an almost uncannily neutral expression, but his body is taut, as though every muscle has tensed up all at once.`
	"CN-41" `	"I think we took a wrong turn. Let's go repair your ship."`
	"CN-42" `	"Now I see what kind of ship you're running, but don't worry, you're among friends. No charge for those repairs."`
	"CN-43" `	"I'll help you, but the price just rose to a million credits, or I leave you here and tell the authorities that you're running a slave ship."`
	"CN-44" `	"I demand that you release your slaves."`
	"CN-45" `	(Attack him immediately.)`
	"CN-46" `	"Yes, let's do that," replies Tarquin. However, his friendly attitude is gone, and he remains as tense as a steel cable. You work in stony silence and awkwardly collect your payment once the <origin> is up and running again.`
	"CN-47" `	You feel relieved that the whole situation is over once you're safely back on board your own ship.`
	"CN-48" `	Tarquin relaxes. "It's so nice to encounter a like-minded captain in this unfriendly galaxy," he says. "I wouldn't dream of accepting repairs for free. Take the money anyway, I insist."`
	"CN-49" `	(Now go repair his ship.)`
	"CN-50" `	(Take advantage of the opening and attack him.)`
	"CN-51" `	You draw your weapon as fast as you can.`
	"CN-52" `	Tarquin can't hope to stand alone against your entire boarding party and quickly surrenders. A look of cold fury glints in his eyes, even as the rest of his face remains calm.`
	"CN-53" `	(Execute him here and now.)`
	"CN-54" `	(Take him prisoner.)`
	"CN-55" `	You instruct one of the members of your boarding party to tie him up and guard him. Tarquin curses you foully and bucks around as you search him, finding a concealed handgun and knife, and the credit chip he was going to pay you. You go to rescue the ship's crew.`
	"CN-56" `	The crew quarters have been fashioned into a brig with stout cell doors. There is no obvious way to open them, so you and your compatriots begin blasting them open.`
	"CN-57" `	Suddenly, a warning klaxon cuts through the noise with a harsh staccato. The ship's self-destruct sequence has been activated! You race to the room where Tarquin was being held, and find that he has somehow escaped. In his place is an unconscious member of your crew with a savage slash across his face, evidently inflicted by an additional concealed weapon you didn't manage to find. A nearby panel indicates that an escape pod has been jettisoned.`
	"CN-58" `	The ship will explode in less than 30 seconds. You realize bitterly that there is no chance you can release the prisoners in time, and trying anyway will just get everyone killed. You and your boarding party storm angrily back to your ship and release the docking clamps just in time for the <origin> to disintegrate into a cloud of space debris, cruelly ending the already unhappy lives of captain Tarquin's victims.`
	"CN-59" `	You vow that it will be the last time you underestimate captain Tarquin, should your paths cross again.`
	"CN-60" `	You search Tarquin and find a concealed handgun and several knives, the credit chip he was going to pay you, and a tiny unlocking device. Then you instruct one of the members of your boarding party to lock him in your ship's brig. Tarquin curses you foully as he is marched to captivity at gunpoint. You resolve to figure out what to do with him later, and go to rescue the ship's crew.`
	"CN-61" `	You gun captain Tarquin down in cold blood, to the shock of at least one member of your boarding party. Good riddance to bad rubbish, you think, as you search the body of ex-captain Tarquin. You find a concealed handgun and several knives, the credit chip he was going to pay you, and a tiny unlocking device. You go to rescue his crew with it.`
	"CN-62" `	Tarquin eyes your boarding party and stares at you icily for at least five uncomfortable seconds before finally replying. "Fine," he said coldly, his eyes blazing with barely contained rage, even as the rest of his face remains calm. He remains as tense as a steel cable as you and your team repair the ship in stony silence, awkwardly collecting your payment once the <origin> is up and running again.`
	"CN-63" `	"It'll be a cold day in hell before I get blackmailed by someone dumb enough to board a disabled ship all alone," sneers Tarquin.`
	"CN-64" `	Captain Tarquin throws back his head and laughs at the exact moment that he draws a concealed pistol and shoots you with it five times - all in the blink of an eye. Your last thoughts concern the effectiveness of his distraction and the foolishness of your bravado.`
	"CN-65" `	Quick as a flash, he whips out a concealed pistol and drills a hole in your spine before you can react. The dangerous game you were playing ends abruptly.`
	"CN-66" `	Quick as a flash, he whips out a concealed pistol, but you're faster. It's the last mistake he ever makes. You search the body of ex-captain Tarquin, finding several concealed knives in addition to his handgun, the credit chip he was going to pay you, and a tiny unlocking device. You go to rescue the crew with it.`
	"CN-67" `	The ship's crew quarters have been fashioned into a brig with stout cell doors. Fortunately the unlocking device opens them all, and close to a dozen malnourished wretches stumble out, telling you the whole story: captain Tarquin has been keeping them as slaves for the past several months, locking them in their quarters when the ship makes berth, and with no food as a punishment when they complain. They are quite happy to see his lifeless body sprawled out on the deck plating.`
	"CN-68" `	You turn the <origin> over to them and return to your ship.`
	"CN-69" `	The ship's crew quarters have been fashioned into a brig with stout cell doors. Fortunately the unlocking device opens them all, and close to a dozen malnourished wretches stumble out, telling you the whole story: captain Tarquin has been keeping them as slaves for the past several months, locking them in their quarters when the ship makes berth, and with no food as a punishment when they complain. They are quite happy to hear that he has been taken into captivity.`
	"CN-70" `	You turn the <origin> over to them and return to your ship to figure out what to do with Tarquin.`
	"CN-71" `	A quick check of the public data in the galactic criminal justice database doesn't reveal that he's wanted for any crimes. You decide to turn him to law enforcement authorities on the nearest planet.`
	"CN-72" `You board the <origin> and look around its derelict hull, which appears to be in fairly stable condition. You could risk repairing it for a greater profit, or you could salvage what you can from the ship and leave the rest.`
	"CN-73" `	(Salvage the ship.)`
	"CN-74" `	(Attempt to repair the ship.)`
	"CN-75" `	Deciding to go for the bigger score you attempt to repair the ship.`
	"CN-76" `	(Repair the engines first.)`
	"CN-77" `	(Repair the hull first.)`
	"CN-78" `	(Repair the power first.)`
	"CN-79" `	With a few simple repairs you manage to get the ship's power systems operational and running smoothly.`
	"CN-80" `	(Repair the engines next.)`
	"CN-81" `	(Repair the hull next.)`
	"CN-82" `	It takes a while but you manage to stabilize the ship's hull. While doing so you managed to find and fix some broken wiring embedded in the hull, which could have caused a powersurge.`
	"CN-83" `	(Repair the power next.)`
	"CN-84" `	(Repair the power.)`
	"CN-85" `	(Flee the ship for fear my repairs have made the ship more dangerous.)`
	"CN-86" `	(Repair the engines.)`
	"CN-87" `	With the repairs finished you head to the cockpit to see if the <origin> starts without exploding. Prepared to bolt for the airlock should things go wrong, you start the ship.`
	"CN-88" `	The ship thrums to life. With bated breath you wait for the sound of some system exploding, but nothing happens. Success! The ship is yours.`
	"CN-89" `	As you are fixing the engine systems a valve bursts open. Luckily the secondary valve is mechanical and doesn't need power, allowing it to close itself automatically and prevent the coolant from forcefully spraying out. With more caution, you finish up your repairs of the engines.`
	"CN-90" `	As you are fixing the engine systems a valve bursts open. Luckily you restored power, allowing the secondary valve to close itself automatically and prevent the coolant from forcefully spraying out. With more caution, you finish up your repairs of the engines.`
	"CN-91" `	(Repair the hull.)`
	"CN-92" `	With a few simple repairs you manage to get the ship's power systems operational. Briefly. The power shuts down again with a violent vibration shuddering through the ship. You quickly run back to your ship before the <origin> breaks apart.`
	"CN-93" `	As you are patching up a segment of hull you notice that a deformation in it is slowly expanding. To make matters worse, this is a structurally essential part of the hull. You quickly run back to your ship before the <origin> breaks apart.`
	"CN-94" `	As you are fixing the engine systems a valve bursts open. With no power the secondary valve cannot close itself off, letting coolant uncontrollably fly into the hull. The force of the liquid sends a violent vibration shuddering through the ship. You quickly run back to your ship before the <origin> breaks apart.`
	"CN-95" `	Wary of your own foolish repairs you decide to leave the ship alone. However, you did manage to hang onto a little bit of scrap worth <payment> you found during your repairs.`
	"CN-96" `	Your fears seem to be warranted as the <origin> begins to falls apart the moment you detach.`
	"CN-97" `	As it begins to thrum to life, a loud explosion rocks the ship!`
	"CN-98" `	(Run.)`
	"CN-99" `	You start running through the tight corridors of the ship. Objects are tumbling everywhere, and more explosions threaten to sweep you off your feet.`
	"CN-100" `	(Run into the airlock.)`
	"CN-101" `	(Dive for the airlock.)`
	"CN-102" `	(Slide into the airlock.)`
	"CN-103" `	As you slide across the floor, explosions erupt on both sides of you, and you're sure that you look like an action hero as you careen through the airlock to safety. Having narrowly escaped death and not wishing to chance it, you quickly depart.`
	"CN-104" `	As you run towards the airlock, explosions erupt on both sides of you, and you're sure that you look like an action hero as you barge through the airlock to safety. Having narrowly escaped death and not wishing to chance it, you quickly depart.`
	"CN-105" `	As you dive towards the airlock, explosions erupt on both sides of you, and you're sure that you look like an action hero as you tuck and roll through the airlock to safety. Having narrowly escaped death and not wishing to chance it, you quickly depart.`
	"CN-106" `	Despite your best efforts to make the ship actually fly, it just won't. On the upside, now you have time to loot and pilfer some outfits from the ship as you please. Before leaving the cockpit you find a credit chip sitting on the controls worth <payment>.`
	"CN-107" `	However, you notice a blinking light on the controls of the ship. You wonder what it could signal as you approach it, and once you get close enough you realize that it warns of the arrival of "hostile spacecraft" entering the system. The derelict must have been a pirate trap, and to make matters worse, the ship appears to be rigged to blow! You now have a pretty good guess at what you're dealing with as you race back to your ship.`
	"CN-108" `	However, moments later a screen lights up in the cockpit displaying something strange. Upon closer inspection you realize it's some form of malicious software, and it's attempting to hack into your ship!`
	"CN-109" `	You race back to your ship, quickly launching and destroying the <origin>, but by the time you manage to destroy the virus it has already hacked into your bank account; your account reports a change in balance of <payment>.`
	"CN-110" `	Deciding not to risk it you quickly scour the ship for valuable scrap and outfits.`
	"CN-111" `	Upon a brief inspection of the ship you find few valuables, only managing to salvage a meager <payment> from the <origin>.`
	"CN-112" `	Searching through the ship you find that it is quite valuable; you manage to salvage a substantial amount from the <origin>, worth <payment>.`
	"CN-113" `	Hidden away under a panel you find a small box. Opening it reveals it is filled with <payment>.`
	"CN-114" `	As you search the ship for anything valuable you find a large black case filled with 325,000 credits. Investigating further you find a text log next to the case, and you decide to take both of them with you.`
	"CN-115" `	As you search the ship for anything valuable you find some kind of map tucked into a panel. It's easy to carry, allowing you time to further salvage a meager <payment> from the <origin>.`
	"CN-116" `	(Detonate the ship and leave so that others can't loot it.)`
	"CN-117" `	(Try and find a bit more salvage.)`
	"CN-118" `	Before you depart you detonate the ship to prevent any other derelict hunters from scouring the now empty ship.`
	"CN-119" `	You attempt to search the ship for more valuables and luckily find some extra salvage worth <payment>. However, the hull begins to creak and groan, prompting a hasty return to your ship.`
	"CN-120" `	Not a moment too soon, as the <origin> begins to violently fall apart the moment your ship detaches.`
	"CN-121" `	You attempt to search the ship for more valuables but to no avail. However, the hull begins to creak and groan, prompting a hasty return to your ship.`
	"CN-122" `	You make your way to the cockpit in the hopes of finding any valuables. Initially finding nothing, you turn to leave and search more of the ship.`
	"CN-123" `Today, throughout human space, is Remembrance Day, the anniversary of the beginning of the Alpha Wars more than five centuries ago. The Alphas were genetically engineered soldiers, with superhuman agility and intelligence, and a complete lack of compassion or empathy. At the height of the War, dozens of planets had been enslaved by the Alphas.`
	"CN-124" `	Remembrance Day commemorates the beginning of the war, rather than its end, as a perpetual reminder that the war is not over: although the Alphas were defeated, some of them escaped and remained in hiding, and they and their offspring are presumed to still be present in the galaxy today.`
	"CN-125" `	Since the Alpha War, genetic resequencing technology has been very tightly controlled. Because the Alphas were the product of experimental genetic manipulation rather than natural evolution, it is believed that their genes are less robust than true human beings, and they are almost unable to have viable offspring without access to special technology. Therefore, most Alpha enclaves that have been discovered since the War have had very small populations, no more than a few dozen.`
	"CN-126" `	In these days when the Navy ensures peace throughout much of the galaxy, on many worlds the Alphas are treated as nothing more than a bogeyman story to frighten children. Because the most striking physical feature of the Alphas was their photosynthetic skin, on some worlds kids even run around wearing green face paint on Remembrance Day, trying to frighten people. But on other worlds, especially on the fringes of space where the Navy seldom patrols, the Alphas are still spoken of with fear.`
	"CN-127" `The moment you step off your ship you realize something is very wrong. The spaceport is eerily quiet, and a large crowd of people is gathered around a video screen in the local bar.`
	"CN-128" `	You ask what is happening, and someone explains. Recently, a collection of planetary governments in the southern galactic arm have sent the Republic what amounted to an ultimatum: a refusal to pay taxes until reforms are made in the election of planetary representatives. This group, calling itself the "Free Worlds," has also asked for immediate reevaluation of all existing trade tariffs and regulations concerning pilot registration. Parliament outright refused to consider any of these demands.`
	"CN-129" `	Then, in the early morning, nuclear explosions on Geminus and Martini destroyed the Republic Navy Yard and the Galactic Stock Exchange, crippling the military and economic center of the Republic. The "Free Worlds" disclaim any responsibility for the attacks, despite the timing and the fact that the attacks serve their purposes very well.`
	"CN-130" `	Unless the terrorists can be found or turn themselves in, civil war is imminent. It has been less than a year since you bought your ship, and already the galaxy is falling apart on you.`
	"CN-131" `	The moment you step off your ship you realize something is very wrong. Heavily armed Navy personnel flank either side of the spaceport building's exit, and more soldiers are patrolling the port. A liaison officer is herding a group of civilians toward a low bunker beside a nearby landing pad. On the landing pad itself, soldiers are struggling to set up a heavy plasma cannon mounted on an anti-aircraft turret.`
	"CN-132" `	With the civilians safely in the bunker, the liaison officer turns to face you. "I'm sorry, Captain, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave the planet. We've got a Carrier squadron coming in, and we need all the pads free."`
	"CN-133" `	"Of course."`
	"CN-134" `	"What's happening?"`
	"CN-135" `	"Is this some sort of training exercise?"`
	"CN-136" `	"What makes you think you can just order me to leave?"`
	"CN-137" `	The liaison officer sighs. "Captain, I'm afraid the planet is in a state of emergency. Yesterday, some rogue planets down south decided they wanted to secede from the Republic. Sent Parliament an ultimatum, wanted electoral and tax reform, free trade, all the same things they've been complaining about for years. No big deal. Three hours ago, though, the Navy Yard here on Geminus was bombed along with the Galactic Stock Exchange on Martini. We don't know if it's the work of the 'Free Worlds' rebels or not, and I can't promise you there aren't going to be more attacks. All I know is that whoever did this used nuclear weapons, so we've got three thousand injured people we need to get to off-planet medical care immediately."`
	"CN-138" `	"I'll get out of the way, then."`
	"CN-139" `	"Sorry, I didn't know. I'll be out of your hair as soon as I can lift off."`
	"CN-140" `	"Is there any way I can help?"`
	"CN-141" `	As you descend towards the surface of Martini, you are met by an uncharacteristic layer of thick cloud, almost smoky in appearance. The clouds completely obscure Martini's main spaceport, as well as the rest of the capital city. Perhaps because of this, the landing controller instructs you to make your way to an auxiliary spaceport about ten kilometers from the city limits.`
	"CN-142" `	The moment you step off your ship you realize something is very wrong. Heavily armed Navy personnel flank either side of the spaceport building's exit, and more soldiers are patrolling the port. The main road to the city echoes with sirens, and a liaison officer is herding a group of civilians toward a military transport parked precariously in a nearby field. Still more people are stretched out on cots in a makeshift field hospital in the center of the spaceport.`
	"CN-143" `	As soon as the last mobile civilian is safely aboard the transport, the liaison officer turns to face you. "I'm sorry, Captain, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave the planet. We've got another transport fleet coming in, and we need all the pads free."`
	"CN-144" `	The liaison officer sighs. "Captain, I'm afraid the planet is in a state of emergency. Yesterday, some rogue planets down south decided they wanted to secede from the Republic. Sent Parliament an ultimatum, wanted electoral and tax reform, free trade, all the same things they've been complaining about for years. No big deal. Three hours ago, though, someone - quite possibly this same 'Free Worlds' group - dropped a nuclear bomb on the Galactic Stock Exchange right here on Martini. At least, we presume that the Stock Exchange was their target, since the bomb took about a quarter of the city with it, as well as the main spaceport and half of the planet's medical resources. We've got more than a million injured people here and another five million we need to evacuate. To top it off, the terrorists also bombed the Navy Yard on Geminus, which means we don't have enough personnel available to both run the evacuation and deal with other civilians."`
	"CN-145" `	"Look, Captain. The government here on <planet> has declared a state of emergency, and that means that the spaceport is under martial law. I'm not sure how you managed to get landing clearance, but you shouldn't be here. We've got thousands of injured people to get off-planet, even if we ignore the potential for a major follow-up attack. If you refuse to comply, I will have you arrested by the military police, and your ship will be impounded. If your crew refuses to accept the change in captainship, they will be replaced by troops from the Naval Reserve Command. Think what you will, but we've got human lives to save here and we aren't going to stop just because some hotshot captain is feeling full of themself. Is that clear?"`
	"CN-146" `	"Yes, that's clear."`
	"CN-147" `	"Sorry, I didn't know. You won't have any trouble from me."`
	"CN-148" `	"Yeah, right. No way are you going to seize my ship."`
	"CN-149" `	The liaison officer glowers at you, then turns and signals to another soldier. Military police officers in full combat gear materialize behind you, grabbing you by the arms and handcuffing you tightly. As you're frogmarched toward a waiting bunker, you watch as the <ship> lifts off without you, leaving you stranded here. In the bunker, one of the soldiers who arrested you frisks you, seizing your pilot's license and handing it to a sergeant who stamps the words "Permanently Revoked" across it. With those two words, you are barred from space forever. It has been less than a year since you bought your ship, and already you have lost the right to use it as the galaxy falls apart on you.`
	"CN-150" `	"Glad to hear it," they reply, turning to calm a group of hysterical Paradisians.`
	"CN-151" `	Re-entering the <ship>, you take off and head for orbit, narrowly missing the Carrier squadron mentioned by the liaison officer. Only then do you see that you've left the video screen in your ship on, playing footage almost identical to what you saw on the ground not long ago. According to the newscaster, this debacle was all started yesterday, when a group of planets in the south of the galaxy sent the Republic Parliament an ultimatum: a refusal to pay taxes until reforms are made in the election of planetary representatives. This group, calling itself the "Free Worlds," has also asked for immediate reevaluation of all existing trade tariffs and regulations concerning pilot registration. Parliament outright refused to consider any of these demands.`
	"CN-152" `	Then, only hours before you landed, nuclear explosions on Geminus and Martini destroyed the Republic Navy Yard and the Galactic Stock Exchange, crippling the military and economic center of the Republic. The "Free Worlds" disclaim any responsibility for the attacks, despite the timing and the fact that the attacks serve their purposes very well.`
	"CN-153" `	The liaison officer responds with a curt thank-you and turns around to calm a hysterical Paradisian. You re-enter the <ship>, and prepare to take off. It has been less than a year since you bought your ship, and already the galaxy is falling apart on you.`
	"CN-154" `	"Yes. You can take off like I asked you to." The officer pauses. "Sorry, Captain, I'm sure you have the best of intentions, but that's the truth. The Navy has personnel trained for responding to nuclear disasters, and all you'd be doing here is taking up extra space." The officer turns around, interrupted by the shrieks of a panicked Paradisian. You re-enter the <ship>, and prepare to take off.`
	"CN-155" `When you walk into <origin>'s outfitter, you notice it has a raft of new outfits for sale; cooling equipment, afterburners, even new generators. Strangely, almost all the new stock appears to be from Kraz Cybernetics and Delta V - companies you'd usually see selling along the Southern Rim, not far up here so close to the center of the Republic. It is especially strange as those companies have been vocal supporters of the Free Worlds secessionists.`
	"CN-156" `	(Ask the proprietor about the new outfits.)`
	"CN-157" `	(Move on.)`
	"CN-158" `	The proprietor's busy at his desk inside the outfitter's small office, but as you approach he gets up and acknowledges you. "Hi, how can I help you today?"`
	"CN-159" `	"How come you're selling Kraz and Delta V outfits up here?"`
	"CN-160" `	"It looks like you've got new stock."`
	"CN-161" `	"You're not the first to ask!" the proprietor responds overly brightly. "With piracy on the rise, the increased tensions, and - what everybody's assuming but not saying - impending conflict with the nuke-happy secessionists down in the Southern Rim, we've had a lot of requests to stock some more... specialized equipment."`
	"CN-162" `	He walks you over to a crate of Javelins. "A load of this stuff comes from the Syndicate, you know. Apparently they already had a load of these missiles in production, but now that Kraz and Delta V are no longer companies operating in the Republic, they've snapped up all the rights to manufacture their products!" He chuckles. "It's great for captains who rely on Delta V equipment but can't go down to the Southern Rim to restock their gear."`
	"CN-163" `	"Yes, yes we do!" He walks up to you. "Nitrogen coolers, Heavy Rockets, radar jammers to ward off those pesky Lovelace Sidewinders, high-power afterburners, you name it. We've had a lot of requests to stock equipment from the Southern Rim, now with all the tension down there making it hard to do business."`
	"CN-164" `	The proprietor leans in towards you a little and says in a softer tone, "But you know, it's wrong to get supplies from the people who did those bombings and killed tens of thousands of people. It's simply wrong. Morally and commercially.`
	"CN-165" `	"Courtesy of Syndicated Systems, however, you can get southern gear here without supporting those secessionists! They saw an opportunity to get the rights for Delta V and Kraz equipment, and they took it. And you get to benefit," he chuckles.`
	"CN-166" `	He produces a brochure from his vest jacket and hands it to you. "Now, if you're interested in any of our new stock, just flag down one of our workers and we'll have it prepared and installed on your ship promptly.`
	"CN-167" `	"I wish you safe travels," he says, and returns to his office.`
	"CN-168" `Passing through the spaceport you see a sizable group of people waiting on a lottery draw. You hear a whoop of success, and your attention is drawn as one of them wins a moderate sum in a 12th division win. It's one or two days' worth of standard pay.`
	"CN-169" `	It's difficult not to pity them as they immediately buy more tickets with the whole value.`
	"CN-170" `A roadblock interrupts your path as you make your way towards the city, forcing you to slow down as you pass by, able to see what the commotion is about. Police wave past car after car coming from the other direction, looking into the vehicles until one gets pulled over to the side, causing police to briefly halt all traffic movements. The driver seems distressed, refusing to open the back even when he is being detained; his face goes pale when a little girl is found inside.`
	"CN-171" `	You're not sure how to feel about this when the police wave you off, blocking your view from the scene.`
	"CN-172" `As you wander the spaceport with a snack, waiting for your ship to be refueled, you pass a local souvenir shop and poke your head in to kill a little time. You see a decent looking mug with the text "Peace, Prosperity, Progress" printed underneath the insignia of the Deep and pick it up to see how it feels. The handle is solid, not too small for your fingers, and the lip of it looks like it would be comfortable to drink out of.`
	"CN-173" `	Two young adults wander into the aisle just a couple of meters away, conversing in a language that you don't understand, one that is perhaps local to the Deep. They're cooing over an item they've found, but when one flips it over to look at the price tag, there is an immediate exchange of looks and expressions that does not require translation. The item ends up back on the shelf with a giggle and a headshake.`
	"CN-174" `	Curious, you turn over your own mug and see that it is indeed at least five times what you would expect to pay for a mug, even a good one: 50 credits. Still, it is certainly a novelty...`
	"CN-175" `	(Buy the mug.)`
	"CN-176" `	(Put it back.)`
	"CN-177" `	You roll your eyes and put it back. Some experiences really are universal.`
	"CN-178" `	You purchase the mug on an impulse. At least you can ditch your other one with a chip in it.`
	"CN-179" `	Curious, you turn over your own mug, and when you spot the 50 credit price tag your heart sinks. You could never afford such an expensive mug. You put it back and walk away while pondering your financial situation.`
	"CN-180" `The skies pour down onto the world below, weeping together with the crowds as a plain but stately coffin is carried slowly from a void deck. Rhythmic wailing blends with the susurrant rain, filling the air as the coffin is followed closely by procession of mourners that look to be an extensive gathering of family. Even as it is placed into the van they do not leave the departed, a number of their hands placed on it as if pushing the person toward their final resting place. The two foremost mourners, a woman and a young man, climb in and take their seats next to it. Somewhere nearby, music begins to play as the vehicle slowly moves off.`
	"CN-181" `	You wonder how well known the person was before they died as those remaining finally turn away from the van receding into the distance and begin to file past some discreet attendants you hadn't noticed at first, accepting slippers for their bare feet before boarding the buses waiting to take them after the van.`
	"CN-182" `The smell of burning metal fills the air as you walk down the uncrowded streets of the factory town near the spaceport, keeping away from the arterial supply route directly feeding the port and its hangars.`
	"CN-183" `	Despite the distance and absent traffic though, it is far from quiet. Several factory buildings make discernible thrumming noises, and grinders echo amidst the silence as you investigate. Turning a corner, you come across an alley running along a lengthy chain link fence line. Beyond it, you can see a throng of men cutting away at a spaceship. Parts regularly fall to the floor, the workers apparently heedless of those below.`
	"CN-184" `	Even as you watch you see a hull plate swinging dangerously above a workers head.`
	"CN-185" `	(Call out a warning.)`
	"CN-186" `	(Leave them be.)`
	"CN-187" `	You call out a warning and most of the men pause to look at you, the hull plate swinging gently as the holder of the offending grinder squints in your direction. One of the older men, who you now realize was at least somewhat overseeing the activity, steps forward and flicks his hands at you in a shooing motion. "Oi you, piss off. We've got our safety supervisor, we don't need your nose in our business."`
	"CN-188" `	(Challenge the claim.)`
	"CN-189" `	You point out that what you were seeing did not look at all safe, supervised or not, and the man glances around briefly before huffily making his way over to stand opposite you behind the fence. "Look stranger," he says, "work here is hard to find. For those working here, we don't have the time to spare. But the pay is good and we can at least feed our kids. Sure, some people get a few scrapes and bruises, but no one has died on my watch, and Rik only lost his smallest finger. If you feel the need to watch then fine, stand around, but leave us be, okay? There ain't no one around here that'll care what you have to say anyway."`
	"CN-190" `	He looks you dead in the eyes, and once he is sure you understand his message he stomps back over to his crew, who continue their work. You watch them cut the dead ship apart until its pieces completely fill the trailer they have with them, before they proceed to haul the parts away to a factory in the distance.`
	"CN-191" `	You turn and depart. A moment later you hear a clatter and a shout, but when you look back no one appears to have been injured.`
	"CN-192" `As you move about the spaceport, you can't avoid the terrible smell. It's like a trash fire, but you can't see any sort of smoke.`
	"CN-193" `	(Ignore it.)`
	"CN-194" `	(Ask around.)`
	"CN-195" `	You ask one of the locals who doesn't look too busy. They sadly inform you that there's been a bumper banana crop, but unfortunately other wealthier worlds had a bumper crop at the same time, and there's nowhere to either sell or store a significant excess. Distressed farmers are burning the excess fruit to make fertilizer for the next season, the wind has carried the smell all over town.`
	"CN-196" `	You leave the mysterious smell to the locals and continue on your business.`
	"CN-197" `Pausing to consider a restaurant for your dinner, you notice a local worker with a small handful of credits eagerly eyeing the menu. His clothes are neatly worn and look freshly brushed, but it's impossible not to notice the dirty marks and stains that haven't washed out. The man undeniably seems nervous, and he looks at the formal dining layout with an obvious lack of familiarity. Looking at the menu yourself, you realize that while the prices are very affordable for you, they would've been unreachable before your career change.`
	"CN-198" `	(Offer to pay for the man's dinner.)`
	"CN-199" `	(Silently pity the man.)`
	"CN-200" `	(Smile at the man.)`
	"CN-201" `	You smile at the man and reflect on the value of small achievements. He catches your smile out of the corner of his eye and gives you a hesitant but friendly wave back before you go about your business.`
	"CN-202" `	You enter the restaurant and catch the man's attention, offering to pay for his meal.`
	"CN-203" `	He recognizes you as a pilot and frowns, before telling you where you can stick that offer in colorful terms. As you walk away, you think about what your reaction would be if a much wealthier individual pitied you by paying for your dinner.`
	"CN-204" `	You pity the man who has to work a full month to afford this and continue on your way.`
	"CN-205" `Visiting the Paradise spaceports is always an interesting experience for someone from abroad. Nowhere else is class such an ingrained component of daily life. You find yourself noticing people who seem to be invisible to most of those going about their business, but they never catch your eye. They always appear to be doing their utmost to avoid notice.`
	"CN-206" `	You haven't noticed children that look poor here in the past, but on this occasion you spot one as he knocks over a mop and bucket... right in front of a businessman and his family rolling their bags through the spaceport. You've never seen someone go so deathly pale as the cleaner, the boy's mother, who scurries to fix things before the man even draws a breath.`
	"CN-207" `	A pair of security officers appear almost immediately, before you could intercede one way or the other, as the man and his family begin to complain. One officer provides assurances as the other supervises the cleaner, who quickly hurries her child out of harm's way.`
	"CN-208" `On a whim, you decide to dine in at a restaurant well clear of the busy spaceport. You swiftly find yourself searching up a list of delicacies on a physical menu as people stream past the window by your booth, each looking drained from the long work day. Meal soon ordered, you continue watching the crowd until it arrives, a local version of a katsu don and dig in.`
	"CN-209" `	The place is quiet, perhaps a little early for the dinner rush yet, and you are halfway through your meal when a waiter stops beside you, coughing to catch your attention.`
	"CN-210" `	"May I help you?"`
	"CN-211" `	"Yes?"`
	"CN-212" `	"What do you want?"`
	"CN-213" `	"Sorry," he says, grabbing the edges of his shirt. "But... may I ask... what's it like to see the stars? To visit other worlds?"`
	"CN-214" `	"Most worlds are the same or worse than here."`
	"CN-215" `	"The stars are prettier under an atmosphere."`
	"CN-216" `	"It's an adventure, but not for the faint of heart."`
	"CN-217" `	"Oh... I've never seen any pilots, so I never got to ask," he says, slightly dejected. "Thank you very much for telling me though!"`
	"CN-218" `	He goes back to his work, with a thoughtful expression of neutral satisfaction on his face.`
	"CN-219" `The low rumble of "Tonners," heavy trucks for moving troops and supplies, rolling down the street causes heads to turn and look at the blocky yet imposing vehicles slowing to a stop. The driver and the commander of the foremost vehicle have their eyes on the road, watching out for any traffic hazards that might pose a risk to either the vehicle or their support.`
	"CN-220" `	The troops within the back of each tonner, on the other hand, are making small talk, the camo on their face smearing off in the heat. One of them points at you, saying something that garners him a groan from his peers, and you decided that you probably don't want to know what he said.`
	"CN-221" `A group of children waves at you as you step off your ship, marveling at the spacecraft on display as their teachers try and fail to hold their attention. You can see the fading of their uniform colors from afar as their group walks past, yet none of them look one bit displeased. While you make your way into the spaceport itself, you wonder how many of them may eventually own their own spaceship and fly across the stars.`
	"CN-222" `With an annoyingly long stopover having encouraged you to do a little exploring, you rent a car for a short drive around the immediate area. Later, as you pull the car into the designated return parking lot, the unexpected sound of large hydraulic motors draws your attention. You watch as a massive turret lifts up from behind a nearby barricade and turns toward the sky, its single cannon poised to fire at seemingly nothing.`
	"CN-223" `	Looking around for some form of explanation you find a plaque placed conveniently nearby dedicating the turret, and five others like it, offering protection and discouraging piracy until relatively recent years. You can't help but wonder how well the turrets would do if they were to be actually used again.`
	"CN-224" `Smog fills your windscreen as you make your descent, trying and failing to see anything more than a few meters in front of you. The autopilot systems show solid green across the full range of indicators though, and traffic control has confirmed a lock.`
	"CN-225" `	(Land on autopilot.)`
	"CN-226" `	(Return to orbit.)`
	"CN-227" `	You let the craft perform the landing, staring blankly at the haze until it clears.`
	"CN-228" `	On the ground, you see the cause, fields upon fields of plantations burning. You see a crowd of mostly farmers blocking off a smaller group of firefighters, arguing and trying to stop them from putting out the flames as planes fly overhead, dropping water and retardants wherever necessary.`
	"CN-229" `	You recall seeing something like this years ago, of farmers burning their crops to make the land fertile, and how bad the air was for months.`
	"CN-230" `	Unwilling to trust landing blind into an unknown situation, you return to orbit and rejoin the spaceport processing queue. One day of delay is a worthwhile price to pay for surety.`
	"CN-231" `The smell of burning smoke permeates the air as you step off your craft, causing you to rush towards the nearest shelter, coughing along the way. Once there, you find people shouting and rushing about to get tape plastered onto the windows. No one seems to have noticed your arrival and none give an explanation.`
	"CN-232" `	"Hey! What's happening? I can help!"`
	"CN-233" `	(Look for someone not in motion.)`
	"CN-234" `	You seek out a pregnant lady sitting on a chair, a mask worn as she explains: "A large fire has sprung up nearby, and the wind is fanning it towards the spaceport. Might have been some fool playing with fire, or some pirate sending a message to a local. We don't know, could be anything around here really. We're hunkering down and hoping it'll burn out before it does too much damage."`
	"CN-235" `	"I have a ship out there. Let me help."`
	"CN-236" `	Her eyes widen and she looks around, sharply catching the attention of one of the many people hurrying about.`
	"CN-237" `	A young man who looks suspiciously like he might've been air traffic control twenty minutes ago glances at you and skids to a stop. "Oh, you're a pilot! Can your ship help?"`
	"CN-238" `	"Yes."`
	"CN-239" `	The dock-hands scramble to get the firefighting equipment onto your ship after your proclamation, instructing you to drop the retardants onto the perimeter of the fire. You barely manage to remember what every button does before the Air Traffic Controller clears you to depart, navigating your craft towards the fire.`
	"CN-240" `	The raging fire flares like an inferno, throwing up black smoke in deep billowing waves as you approach. As you drop the retardants, making sure to keep your speed low, animals scramble towards safer grounds. You try to make sure you've not emptied right on top of them each time as you go back for another batch.`
	"CN-241" `	Hours later, you look at your handiwork, a long line of red keeping back the flames as the fire starts to smother out. You radio your progress and receive a cheery response, thanking you for your help.`
	"CN-242" `As you land on the pad, you note a general lack of presence around the spaceport. No one has scrambled to hook up your ship, nor has anybody else acknowledged your arrival. Instead, when you leave your ship, all you find is a note within the spaceport detailing where their "overlords" can find their yearly tribute.`
	"CN-243" `	You decide against finding out where the inhabitants went.`
	"CN-244" `In a strange set of instructions, the Air Traffic Controller has you punch in a set of coordinates, taking you close to a massive military base on the way to the landing zone. You let the autopilot take over as you watch the view off the cockpit window, hoping the turrets in the base won't shoot you out of the sky.`
	"CN-245" `	From where you are watching, you see a single woman standing within the parade square, a hand raised like she's looking at her watch. Seconds pass before she raises her other hand and gives a thumbs up to whoever's looking at her. Suddenly, a loud siren sounds out across the base that is audible even in your ship as it passes by at reasonable height. You watch as soldiers drop everything they're doing, some rushing into buildings while others run toward armored vehicles. Within minutes, the base's vehicles are rolling towards the parade square whilst soldiers in full gear run to assemble within the square in neat rows.`
	"CN-246" `	You aren't sure whether what they were doing was scheduled, or if it was in response to your flight.`
	"CN-247" `The sun has already set when you walk out of the spaceport, trying to find a nearby restaurant to sample their wares. Looking around, the only source of light comes from the building you just exited, a beacon within the sea of darkness.`
	"CN-248" `	Choosing a random direction, you decide to walk down the quiet street, taking in the sights. You are interrupted as two men rush from an alley, pushing past you as they go. Before you can respond, you see a woman run out, clothes in disarray as she gives chase to the two men to no avail. Belatedly, you realize that they were holding a purse, long after they've disappeared, melting into the blackness beyond.`
	"CN-249" `You blink in surprise as you enter the spaceport, watching throngs of people pushing their way through the human chains of queues wrapped around the commercial area. You scan your surroundings and notice advertisements upon advertisements of vacation locations, all at an absurdly high discount. Yet despite their vastly reduced prices, the advertised holidays still cost such large sums that a younger you could never have justified such expense.`
	"CN-250" `As you walk past a number of ships and crew going about their work in the spaceport, a small gathering in front of a Shuttle catches your attention. A young woman wearing a rather cheesy pilot uniform is in the midst of a little group of people all celebrating together. As you pass by them, a man standing on the top of a ladder breaks a bottle of Champagne on the (clearly not new) ship's hull. A loud cheer erupts from the group, earning an embarrassed blush from the young woman.`
	"CN-251" `	(Take a closer look.)`
	"CN-252" `	(Shout well wishes as I pass by.)`
	"CN-253" `	(Ignore them, I have more important things to do.)`
	"CN-254" `	You hurry past the rowdy group, annoyed by the disturbance.`
	"CN-255" `	You hurry past the group as they quiet down. Taking advantage of the momentary lull, you shout "Good luck! You've got this!" toward them. They let out another cheer in response, with the exception of the young woman who buries her face in her hands.`
	"CN-256" `	You approach the group as they quiet down, noticing a hint of anxiety in the air.`
	"CN-257" `	"Nothing quite like buying your very first starship," you say over their chatter. The celebration goes quiet as they turn to see who interrupted their little party.`
	"CN-258" `	"It's certainly been an... experience," the young woman replies once you are in comfortable talking distance.`
	"CN-259" `	"Have you got any big plans with it?"`
	"CN-260" `	(Give some advice.)`
	"CN-261" `	"So, who's the lucky pilot?"`
	"CN-262" `	You gesture to the Shuttle and look around as if it should be anyone else.`
	"CN-263" `	"Uhh... that would be me," the woman says, glancing around awkwardly.`
	"CN-264" `	(Try to salvage the awkward situation.)`
	"CN-265" `	(Get out while I can.)`
	"CN-266" `	"I'm just messing with you, my psychiatrist doesn't think it's very funny when I do it to him either."`
	"CN-267" `	"Oh," the woman says quietly, "that's... nice, I guess."`
	"CN-268" `	You realize that you have made this random young lady quite uncomfortable by barging in with your input.`
	"CN-269" `	"Well, good luck!" you say with a wave as you hurry away. You barely hear the quiet "thank you" over the burning in your ears.`
	"CN-270" `	"Right now," she says with a sigh, "the only plan I have is to get rid of the massive debt that I'm in because of it."`
	"CN-271" `	"The mortgage isn't so bad as long as you're willing to work hard," you say with a smile, "and there is no shortage of people in need of a ship and a good pilot."`
	"CN-272" `	"I knew you could make a decent living with one, but is it really that easy?" she asks.`
	"CN-273" `	"The work isn't easy, but finding a job is the least of your worries. I'm sure that you'll have this ship paid off in no time."`
	"CN-274" `	You stay around and talk with the aspiring pilot for a few minutes, giving her tips and advice before stating that you have work to do. As you turn to leave, an older man places his hand on your arm, stopping you.`
	"CN-275" `	"Before you go," the man says, "we weren't very sure about this whole 'pilot' thing at first, but it's good to hear that my little girl has made the right decision. Thank you for that."`
	"CN-276" `	"It's the least I could do," you say before walking away.`
	"CN-277" `The smell of burning gunpowder wafts about in the air as you enter a town square, watching as a body is rolled off of a raised platform. Cries and screams fill the air as a masked man drags a lady across the platform and onto the central dias, an old-fashioned pistol to her head as he asks her something you can't make out. Thankfully, the man doesn't shoot, taking his gun off her temple before subsequently knocking her out with his weapon.`
	"CN-278" `	Moments later the small crowd allows him to depart opposite your viewpoint, without incident and without explanation. You aren't quite sure what to make of this scene as the bodies are swiftly dragged away.`
	"CN-279" `You are passing through the spaceport when you see a young woman walking in your direction. Trailing behind her is a multitude of camera drones, each one marked with a logo consisting of two curves pointing inwards.`
	"CN-280" `	(Wait for her to approach.)`
	"CN-281" `	(Hope she doesn't notice me.)`
	"CN-282" `	(Try to avoid her.)`
	"CN-283" `	You take a hallway off to the side to evade her. Just as you think you've gotten out of sight, you hear a voice. "Excuse me!" You turn to see the reporter following you.`
	"CN-284" `	As you continue walking, you hear her call out, "Excuse me!" Suppressing a sigh, you turn to face the reporter.`
	"CN-285" `	As she gets closer to you, she smiles. "Hello Captain! Would you be willing to answer a few questions for our viewers?"`
	"CN-286" `	"Sure, I wouldn't mind."`
	"CN-287" `	"No, I'd rather not."`
	"CN-288" `	The camera drones circle around you as she prepares for the interview. After a few seconds, she smiles at one of the drones and begins.`
	"CN-289" `	"Welcome back. I'm here on <origin> reporting on the situation with the Free Worlds. I'm joined by a merchant captain currently between trips. Captain, what do you think of the ultimatum sent to Parliament?"`
	"CN-290" `	"I think Parliament should reconsider and give the situation some thought."`
	"CN-291" `	"Parliament made the right decision by refusing the demands."`
	"CN-292" `	The reporter frowns. "Can you explain your answer for our viewers?"`
	"CN-293" `	"The interests of every world should be considered, whether we agree or not."`
	"CN-294" `	"The Free Worlds aren't represented well enough to gain traction through normal channels."`
	"CN-295" `	"The Navy is hardly defending that territory, so taxes shouldn't be as much."`
	"CN-296" `	"I would prefer to not answer."`
	"CN-297" `	"I'm not sure that Parliament would agree with you, but I want to thank you for your answers, and for taking the time to do this interview!" she says.`
	"CN-298" `	The drones dart back to follow her as she continues through the spaceport.`
	"CN-299" `	The reporter smiles. "Can you explain that answer for our viewers?"`
	"CN-300" `	"There are proper channels for presenting grievances, and this isn't one of them."`
	"CN-301" `	"It's a very ungrateful thing to do when Parliament is the one protecting them."`
	"CN-302" `	"We are fortunate that many people feel this way! Thank you for your answers, and for taking the time to do this interview!" she says.`
	"CN-303" `As you take a break after a long journey and a longer-feeling landing procedure, you notice a group of people enter the pub where you're sitting, streaming in from the conference complex across the street. They vary in age, dress, and accent, but most have an identical badge dangling from a lanyard around their necks. You notice one badge that's been dropped on the floor, reading "Attendee - 35th Annual Pan-galactic Conference on Interstellar Microbial Genomics and Population Dynamics." The group takes their seats at a long table near to you.`
	"CN-304" `	(Order a meal and listen in to their conversation.)`
	"CN-305" `	(Find somewhere quieter to relax.)`
	"CN-306" `	Fragments of conversation make their way to you through the din of the pub.`
	"CN-307" ``
	"CN-308" `	Two of the younger attendees are looking a bit nervous. "I'm so glad to have my presentation over with. I was so worried about having to present on the first day, but now I can finally just relax and actually listen to the other talks!"`
	"CN-309" `	"Oh definitely! I probably shouldn't even be here - I should really be rehearsing... Oh! Waiter, another beer, please!"`
	"CN-310" `	"Got your slide deck ready for tomorrow?"`
	"CN-311" `	"Yeah, but I'm still terrified. I hate public speaking."`
	"CN-312" `	"Don't worry, you know more about your particular area of expertise than they do. You'll be fine once you're on stage! And besides, graduate school is one giant exercise in public speaking. Comfort comes with practice."`
	"CN-313" `	Another scientist is rolling his eyes after a post-mortem of the day's events. "Is there some law I don't know about that requires every 'question' to start with 'I guess this isn't so much a question as a comment...'?"`
	"CN-314" `	An exasperated academic is speaking emphatically to her friend about what you infer to be a presentation they both heard earlier. "I don't think the nucleotide evidence supports their hypothesis at all! Like, I know the proteomic data could be used to support their conclusion, but they're ignoring synonymous mutations!"`
	"CN-315" `	(Order another beverage and continue listening.)`
	"CN-316" `	(Finish my meal and leave.)`
	"CN-317" `	The group's conversation grows louder by virtue of both passion for the subject as well as the influence of a few drinks.`
	"CN-318" `	"Look, the analysis might be fine, but if they can't even be bothered to provide the version numbers for their analytical software, then it isn't reproducible and that's an automatic 'reject' from me."`
	"CN-319" `	One person is looking slightly shell-shocked after considering what might have been. "Can you believe my computer crashed right before I had to present? Good thing I had backups. Two is one and one is none."`
	"CN-320" `	A group seem to be discussing some other colleagues in the field who are, presumably, not present this evening. "Singh and Esterhazy are such arrogant jerks. Their work is okay, I guess, but not enough to justify their wannabe rockstar personalities!"`
	"CN-321" `	"Sure, but they aren't just arrogant jerks, they're charismatic arrogant jerks. Charisma attracts good grad students to their lab, who produce good papers, who they put their name on. It's a positive feedback loop."`
	"CN-322" `	Grant applications seem to be a common subject. "The Republic Medical Research Agency said my work is too theoretical, but the University of Chiron Department of Microbiology says it's too applied!"`
	"CN-323" `	"That's a conundrum, alright. Maybe you could find some funding from industry? The Syndicate might be interested in your work."`
	"CN-324" `	"Yeah, but I'm not sure yet if I'm willing to give up my academic freedom."`
	"CN-325" `	(Finish up at my own pace.)`
	"CN-326" `	(Settle my bill as quickly as possible and leave.)`
	"CN-327" `	Two attendees compare gripes about job demands. "Teaching sucks. Between class hours, office hours, and preparing lectures, there's hardly any time left for research."`
	"CN-328" `	"That's funny! Teaching undergrads is my one respite from grant-writing!"`
	"CN-329" `	A sociable but exhausted-looking man is sitting back in his chair. "These conferences only last three or four days, but it always feels like it ages you a year."`
	"CN-330" `	You leave after finishing your meal, reflecting on having overheard a slice of a life very different from your own.`
	"CN-331" `	Upon entering the sprawling spaceport, you notice that a group of factory workers are talking to a captain. As you get closer, you see that the captain's flagship, a Shuttle that has seen better days, lacks a hyperdrive.`
	"CN-332" `	"Where's your hyperdrive?"`
	"CN-333" `	"How are you going to travel anywhere with that ship?"`
	"CN-334" `	(Go back to my ship.)`
	"CN-335" `	The captain laughs. "Most pilots are the adventurous type. Not me. I make a pretty decent haul just flying people from Earth to Mars and back. Occasionally I do trips to the Moon for tourists." You notice that she uses the archaic term for Luna. Must be a local expression.`
	"CN-336" `	"Doesn't that get boring?"`
	"CN-337" `	"Is there really enough travel within Sol that you can make a living off of it?"`
	"CN-338" `	"You'd be surprised. There's a lot of people in this system after all, and a lot of those people have enough money to leave Earth but not enough to leave Sol. It's a nice niche I've carved out for myself."`
	"CN-339" `	"For you, maybe. I can tell by your accent that you've done a bit of travelling from your home planet. I like staying closer to home, though. With all the instability in the galaxy - pirates, aliens, and who knows what else - staying in Sol keeps me safe. Call me paranoid, but being in a place where I don't have to worry about that is something I value." She eyes a ship to the side that's having its hull repaired. The damage appears to have been inflicted by a beam weapon.`
	"CN-340" `	You say your goodbyes as you board your ships. Although you are both captains, the trajectory of your lives have taken very different courses.`
	"CN-341" `As you follow the tracking beacons towards Earth's central spaceport, you realize there's something very off. What was the bustling spaceport city is now completely still, and even though it is near midnight, the supertall buildings and skyscrapers are curiously dark; not a light is on for kilometers.`
	"CN-342" `	Despite this, the spaceport seems to still be operational, because the automated procedures of signing landing documents, refueling, and checking your ship's spaceworthiness are completed as you land. In the spaceport terminal, there are wax candles spaced out to bring some light into the now dark corridors. It's a strange sight for the most populated planet in human space.`
	"CN-343" `	(Find someone and ask.)`
	"CN-344" `	(The blackout will probably pass.)`
	"CN-345" `	You approach an information desk in the terminal's atrium that, given the situation, doesn't seem to be as busy as expected. After a moment you get to the attendant behind the counter.`
	"CN-346" `	"What's with the blackout?"`
	"CN-347" `	"When is the blackout going to be fixed?"`
	"CN-348" `	The attendant chuckles to himself. "I should've expected that question from your accent. Today's Earth Day, when all the cities of Earth - and I mean all of them - participate in a total blackout. Even the Parliament building was out today. It makes us think about our origins; that we once lived on the soil without electricity, all confined to just this one planet here, divided and uncertain. Of course, people like me still have to keep working, but for other people it's a day off to enjoy what little wildlife and Earth us Earthlings have left, ironically. Do you have any other questions?`
	"CN-349" `	"When did this tradition start?"`
	"CN-350" `	"Thank you for telling me."`
	"CN-351" `	"Well, my old history class tells me that the first Earth Day was around the 20th century, a few years after we landed on the Moon for the first time. Back then, there were a bunch of conflicts and disputes over resources and how we were fighting all over and digging it all up to power all those dirty, primitive cars, power plants, and factories we had back then. So as a show of unity against that people started celebrating Earth's natural beauty by bringing us back to our past."`
	"CN-352" `	As he finishes, the ceiling lights flash back on. "Ah, well, there you go. Too bad I missed the celebrations, but that's the end of Earth Day and my night shift. I hope you had a good Earth Day, and have a good night!"`
	"CN-353" `	You approach a woman with a bunch of oversized bags clustered around her seat. She's tapping rapidly on her datapad, but nonetheless she looks up when you approach. "Excuse me, Captain, I was just trying to figure out when the metro starts up again. Do you know?"`
	"CN-354" `	"I know just as much as you, sorry."`
	"CN-355" `	"Maybe it's to do with the blackout?"`
	"CN-356" `	"Ha, they shut everything down for Earth Day and then assume all us offworlders get the idea. What do you know..."`
	"CN-357" `	"Earth Day?"`
	"CN-358" `	"Shut everything down?"`
	"CN-359" `	"Didn't you see what was happening outside on your way in? It's something to do with Earth Day. Back in those old days before humans were able to get off this planet, they were stuck in a chain of issues and disputes over energy. You know, they didn't have fusion reactors back then. Awfully primitive times.`
	"CN-360" `	"Yes, I suppose you must have seen what's happening outside on your way in. It's something to do with Earth Day. Back in those old days before humans were able to get off this planet, they were stuck in a chain of issues and disputes over energy. You know, they didn't have fusion reactors back then. Awfully primitive times.`
	"CN-361" `	"So they decided that, on the 22nd of April each year, all of Earth would go into total blackout to symbolize that they didn't have enough energy to sustain themselves, and to remind them that the only way to advance was to keep pushing themselves forward, find new pathways to power, lest those blackouts became longer and more frequent. Fascinating, huh?"`
	"CN-362" `	"It seems a bit backwards."`
	"CN-363" `	"It is fascinating, thanks."`
	"CN-364" `	"Well, perhaps. But Earth is like that sometimes. It's survived through so much, and without Earth Day to remind our ancestors that we must keep looking forward, maybe you wouldn't be in your fancy little spaceship, would you?"`
	"CN-365" `	The lights in the spaceport turn back on as she says that, and she turns to look at her data pad again. "Oh, it's twelve o'clock. I've got to see if the metro's opened so I can get to my accommodation. Safe travels!"`
	"CN-366" `	After the clock passes midnight, the lights in the spaceport come back on, followed by the signage and lights of the city surrounding it. A few workers come and snuff out the candles before putting them away in unseen closets.`
	"CN-367" `Thanks to the planet's high gravity, Burthen is not a common destination, but today the spaceport seems to have a lot of visitors. Many of the usually empty landing pads are occupied, and you notice a sizable crowd at the edge of the spaceport as you step out onto its rather untarnished apron. Some members of the crowd are obviously from offworld judging by their height, and there's even a few media crews standing by, although it looks like their camera drones are struggling with Burthen's gravity.`
	"CN-368" `	(See what's going on.)`
	"CN-369" `	(Avoid the commotion and tend to my own business.)`
	"CN-370" `	Each step takes significantly more effort than you're used to, but you eventually reach the crowd. From the signs that have been put up on the way, it looks like the "Burthen Triathlon" is taking place today, and the spaceport has been designated the finishing point. A couple of especially sturdy-looking marquees have been set up; the smaller one appears to be the administration tent, currently only accessible to event staff, while the other one is far larger and is catering food and drinks for the crowd nearby.`
	"CN-371" `	(Walk over to the catering tent.)`
	"CN-372" `	(Stay outside.)`
	"CN-373" `	(Return to my ship.)`
	"CN-374" `	Thankfully, the walk to the catering tent is far shorter than the walk from your ship, but nevertheless you're exhausted by the time you drag your feet inside. A lot of effort has been put into this tent: the metal chairs are all sturdily-built to allow offworlders to pull themselves up, but cushioned as to not make it uncomfortable to sit in. A small firepit has been built in the middle of the tent, along with a couple fire extinguishers placed nearby, and the whole place is brightly lit in contrast to Burthen's typically chilly weather. Quite a few people, both Burthenians and offworlders, are mingling about here.`
	"CN-375" `	There's a counter in the corner with two levels, apparently so that the Burthenian attending it can serve both offworlders and locals. Alongside the typical drinks you've seen in spaceport bars and some local to the southern Core, the counter also offers a local drink called the "Antigrav" that claims to "ease visitors from Burthen's natural pull," and comes in a specially made glass, all for 30 credits.`
	"CN-376" `	(Order a regular drink from the counter.)`
	"CN-377" `	(Order the Antigrav from the counter.)`
	"CN-378" `	(Don't order anything and leave the tent.)`
	"CN-379" `	You hand over a couple credits for the drink and leave the tent, sipping with some difficulty as you go. The Burthenian at the counter advises you not to drink too much of it at once, and not to drop the cup "unless you want a munted foot for a few weeks."`
	"CN-380" `	It turns out the glass the Antigrav comes with has a miniature repulsor installed so that you don't need to hold it while drinking it. The drink itself is a highly carbonated soda that tastes like something in between lingonberry and raspberry, made from the native berries found in Westland, the district the spaceport is located in. The Burthenian at the counter advises you not to drink too much of it at once and to not turn it off while it's levitating, "lest it falls on your foot and we have to treat your bone fractures."`
	"CN-381" `	Unfortunately, it looks like all the drinks are too pricy for you.`
	"CN-382" `	(Leave the tent.)`
	"CN-383" `	The crowd is a bit more active when you return outside, and over the heads of the locals you see on a large, portable screen that the leading triathlete is a particularly stocky Burthenian, wearing a white helmet and tight, dark sportswear.`
	"CN-384" `	Staying outside in the oppressive gravity and the chilly temperature, you move over to the sidelines and watch the large, portable screen that is broadcasting the leading competitors from above. It appears that competitors are divided into Burthenians and offworlders, with Burthenians wearing white helmets and offworlders wearing red helmets. It's nearing the end of the whole event; the competitor in front is named Abernathy, a stocky Burthenian apparently doing his eleventh Burthen Triathlon. Meanwhile, the leading offworlder is five hundred meters behind him, a competitor from Martini named Caldarone. Apparently, they've been at it for over 11 hours, beginning with a 1.5 kilometer swim, then a 40 kilometer bicycle ride, and finally a 10 kilometer run.`
	"CN-385" `	After a couple minutes, Abernathy emerges from behind a bend, camera drones chasing him. Cheers, whoops, and rather overly enthusiastic hollers erupt from the crowd, raising enormously as he dashes through the finishing straight, the drones now circling around him. Just over the crowd a loudspeaker announces, "And here comes the winner of the Syndicate Athletics Burthen Triathlon, the world triathlete champion, competitor number fifty-eight: Samuel Abernathy!"`
	"CN-386" `	As he nears the finish line the Burthenians' enthusiastic cheers, whoops, and hollers erupt from the crowd, and the camera drones, their repulsors now calibrated for Burthen's gravity, circle around the finishing straight. Just over the crowd a loudspeaker announces, "And here comes the winner of the Syndicate Athletics Burthen Triathlon, the world triathlete champion, competitor number fifty-eight: Samuel Abernathy!"`
	"CN-387" `	Abernathy doesn't slow down until he's within an arm's length of the finishing line; as he crosses it he seizes the tape, making a yelp of simultaneous joy and relief. He holds the tape up before everybody in the crowd and at the cameras pointed at him, taking in the attention (and catching his breath) before accepting a bottle of water from someone on the sidelines.`
	"CN-388" `Every map of human space places Gagarin in the list of seedy, go-at-your-own-risk pirate ports which would bring to mind the likes of Greenrock's fighting pits and Freedom's gear bazaars. Still, it appears much like any other old, slightly run-down Southern spaceport, only at a much grander scale. Being the center of the planet's extensive transportation system, it seems as if you are wading through thousands of Gagarians and offworlders in every atrium and hallway of this spaceport, as they do the same to make their connections on- and off-world.`
	"CN-389" `	But as you make your way into the central hall, you notice that, where you'd expect the greatest activity, everything has stopped. Even the ever-roving antigrav trolleys of cargo and supplies are backed up and motionless, and everybody's attention is directed at some sort of commotion in the very center of the spaceport.`
	"CN-390" `	(Take a look.)`
	"CN-391" `	Stepping through the gaps within the established crowd you end up next to a spaceport gendarme. He appears as if he's meant to be on patrol duty but is too busy watching the distraction to do his job right now. Looking over the banisters beside him, you see first the enormous and oddly empty space in the middle of the hall, then a team of overalls-wearing men armed with drills and brushes. Surrounding them is a cordon of guerrillas in their rosy CCOR uniforms, sizing up the public and the spaceport security around them with their rifles and pistols.`
	"CN-392" `	The painting guerrillas are busily finishing off the touches of what appears to be a statue of the burgundy and white emblem of the Confederated Councils, while a pile of rubble beside it suggests that a symbol of the local government once stood in its place. As they step away from the statue, a lone man in a much better-kept uniform than the others steps forward in front of their work. You can feel the air chilling as he raises his head to speak.`
	"CN-393" `	(Listen in.)`
	"CN-394" `	(Step away before he makes his speech.)`
	"CN-395" `	You don't see any amplification equipment, yet his voice fills the room without effort.`
	"CN-396" `	"Gagarians and offworlders. Captains and travellers. Servicemen and farmers.`
	"CN-397" `	"The worlds of the Outer Rim, and indeed, those of the Republic and the entirety of humanity, have and continue to be despoiled and devastated by ruthless profiteering.`
	"CN-398" `	"The executives of the Syndicate and the landed gentry of the Paradise Worlds steal the efforts of tens of billions of men, women, and children, from Prime to Foundry; from Valhalla to Earth; from Bourne to Hestia, and beyond. And for near a century they have colluded to impose their designs on our worlds! The corporate insurrection in Novo Minho and the gang wars in the northern Outer Rim are an obvious extension of the arm of people like Alastair Korban, only leading to further suffering and bitter destruction in our region!`
	"CN-399" `	"But there is still hope. We can bring about the independence of Gagarin and unify this world that has been lost to the Syndicate-sponsored oligarchs and their cronies and puppet officials. We can reunite the Outer Rim and restore the prosperity stolen from us. We can form a new Confederated Councils and once again shine the light of Belenos across the entire galaxy!"`
	"CN-400" `	The gendarmes look around and consider the response of the crowd around them as the man finishes his speech to scattered applause. The speaker steps down and orders his guerrillas into formation before marching them out of the still crowd and into the back of a dusty, burgundy army van you hadn't noticed before, leaving the remains of the old statue scattered around the empty space.`
	"CN-401" `	You turn around and see the gendarme you ended up next to. He meets your eyes and recognizes your off-world air.`
	"CN-402" `	"Just an everyday interruption, Captain," he says. "Only nostalgists for the old cause. We get a dozen of these incidents a month." He seems to be interrupted by a buzz from the radio receiver at his hip and strides off into the crowd, leaving you on the ledge.`
	"CN-403" `	Slowly but surely, the spaceport snaps out of its shock and picks up its previous momentum, although as you turn around you pass two government-branded trucks mounted with cranes, almost certainly there to carry off the newly installed statue and to clean up the mess left behind by the guerrillas.`
	"CN-404" `Watching the microgravity section of the spaceport from one of the bars in Mordente Cylinder, you observe a Bastion in pirate markings coming nearly too fast for safe approach to the station, its hull covered in gashes and burns from what looks to be Plasma Cannon shots.`
	"CN-405" `	As it comes to a stop in a maintenance bay, the spaceport's engineering shuttles appear from all over and begin buzzing around the Bastion, assessing the damage and beginning the work on repairs. Meanwhile, its crew disperse from the ship and immediately begin unloading a multitude of busted-up crates and containers from the hold, probably raided from a civilian transport. It looks like their haul was worth the damage.`
	"CN-406" `	Within the hour the work shuttles scatter from the ship as they finish patching up its battered hull, and the Bastion maneuvers out of the bay almost as haphazardly as it did when it entered.`
	"CN-407" `Wandering around the main spaceport on Solace, you notice several rows of shiny new landing pads next to the Delta V company offices. A large banner announces that you are witnessing the grand opening of Delta V's new private spaceport, and a crowd of interested spectators has gathered near the perimeter of the fence.`
	"CN-408" `	Suddenly an Argosy comes streaking out of the sky, almost crashing into several smaller ships in the main spaceport before swerving out of sight behind a hangar in the direction of the new landing pads. There are shouts from the throng of onlookers, who all seem to think this was a stunt. Your more practiced eye, however, tells you that there are bullet marks on the Argosy's hull from a Gatling Gun. It was probably a miscalculation by the pilot's computer that almost caused the collision.`
	"CN-409" `	Soon afterwards, an announcement is made from a large speaker, telling bystanders that nothing bad happened and that they can go home now. After staying for a while out of curiosity, the crowd finally disperses. However, you stick around and notice the Argosy flying back into view to land in the main spaceport.`
	"CN-410" `News headlines bombard your comms as you land on <origin>: today is the three hundredth anniversary of the Republic. A crowd has gathered in the local spaceport in something of a celebration as they tune in to the main news stations, websites, and blogs throughout human space that are commenting on this momentous day. However, you notice many passersby moving about with an air of disdain for the festivities, simply trying to get their business here over quickly, and being frustrated at the inevitable slowness of the local facilities today.`
	"CN-411" `	Originally formed by Earth and planets close to it, the Rim, and a few Dirt Belt worlds, the Republic went on to gradually expand and incorporate the Syndicate, Paradise Worlds, and the Deep. For three hundred years now, most of humanity has existed under its flag, and through protests and the space renaissance, waves of colonization, expansion, and battles against remnants of the Alphas, that flag remains flying over most human worlds today.`
	"CN-412" `	Not all is well, of course, as the bombing of Geminus and Martini appears to have set the Republic on the precipice of war with the Free Worlds, in the southern portion of human space. You can't help but feel that much of the cheerfulness about this date has more to do with the national holiday than with a deep-rooted appreciation for the Republic's history and what it stands for.`
	"CN-413" `	The ongoing war with the Free Worlds has greatly diminished what the Republic Department of Arts and Culture no doubt hoped to turn into the public event of the year. Local workers and merchant captains alike whisper among themselves, Navy personnel march to and from warships that come and go at an alarming rate, seemingly unfazed by the historical date, and some bar fights break out between likely inebriated local patriots and those reckless enough to voice their support for the Free Worlds here.`
	"CN-414" `	The recent Free Worlds war seemed to threaten this long history of stability, as battles raged over the skies of dozens of planets, and the threat of an open nuclear war loomed closer as the conflict escalated. The indiscriminate disappearance of many systems close to Earth, followed by the unified human front against the Pug invaders, seems to have knit together the sentiments of many throughout the Republic - for the time being, at least.`
	"CN-415" `	Dimming the mood of the otherwise mostly positive news titles are the comments about a mysterious armada of robotic warships invading the Far North. Having crushed the Navy forces over Farpoint, the fleet was only partially beaten after the detonation of a terrible bomb on Zenith, which wrecked much of the planet. Indeed, it was weeks still before the scattered ships were fully destroyed, and confidence in the Navy's - and, by extension, the Republic's - ability to keep humanity safe seems to have been affected significantly...`
	"CN-416" `	Web comments and news anchors seem to be particularly excited to comment on the recent victory of the Navy over the mysterious armada of robotic warships that invaded the Far North. Though at a great cost to the northern fleet garrisons, the invading fleets were successfully stopped at the Farpoint base, preventing the ships from causing any further harm. Veterans of the Farpoint battle seem to be hoarding the spotlight, giving emotional reports of their memory of the fight, and of the sacrifices they went through to achieve victory.`
	"CN-417" `	(Join the celebration of the Republic's 300th anniversary.)`
	"CN-418" `	(Go on about my day as usual.)`
	"CN-419" `	You switch your media channels off from the celebrations, and get to your ship's system checks. Once you're done, you prepare for just another day.`
	"CN-420" `	You take an hour or two to join in on the festivities, because after all, it's not everyone who can claim to have witnessed a centenary anniversary of a nation. Stepping off the <ship>, you head to the spaceport, have a couple of drinks, speak to some of the locals, and party with a few revelers. Once it's getting late, you head back to your ship and reflect on the meaning of this day throughout human space.`
	"CN-421" `You wander the planet's sun-bleached boardwalk, passing dozens of rum-soaked bars. Eventually, you see a cramped restaurant squeezed between a closed souvenir shop and yet another bar. The building is painted coral with a battered tin awning, and a hand-written board dangles above the door with the words "Fresh Delish Dish Fish."`
	"CN-422" `	A lanky waiter with a braided silver beard and cybernetic left eye aggressively waves you in and gives a practiced yell: "Best Dish Fish in town! Once-in-a-lifetime experience, plus a worlds-renowned souvenir! Try the Dish Fish - the fish that's a dish!"`
	"CN-423" `	"What?"`
	"CN-424" `	"How much?"`
	"CN-425" `	"No thanks."`
	"CN-426" `	"Dish Fish! It's a fish that's a dish. Buccaneer Bay's famous for 'em." The waiter glares at you in mild annoyance. "It's a flat fish with a big head. The skull's flat and has three horns so it stands on its own as a plate, and we cook the rest of the fish to serve on it. You can keep the skull as a plate after. Dish. Fish."`
	"CN-427" `	The waiter puts a hand on your shoulder. "Only 99 credits, what a deal! The skull alone'll cost ya 200 credits anywhere else. What'ya say, want the meal of a lifetime?"`
	"CN-428" `	"Sure."`
	"CN-429" `	"Great! Service fee's included." The waiter snatches your credits, slaps a laminated menu and receipt into your hands, and shoves you into a cramped booth before hurrying away towards the kitchen. You look at the receipt to find that you've been charged 20 credits for a 'seating fee,' 30 credits for a 'convenience fee,' 50 credits for 'fish cleaning,' 80 credits for 'dish assembly,' and 100 credits for a 'service charge' - a total of 379 credits.`
	"CN-430" `	Seated inside, the restaurant is even tighter than it looked from outdoors. There's a single row of tiny tables, a low ceiling, and a handful of other patrons who look like clueless tourists. The menu itself covers seafood and sea-adjacent food like Nine-Eye Pie, Hand-Mashed Helmet, Hydrozoan Lasanga, and a suspiciously named 'Captain's Catch.' The top of the menu has a headline dish written in sloppy cursive with a prominent infobox beneath taking up a full third of the menu:`
	"CN-431" `		Dish Fish: Natural Wonder and Souvenir - 99 credits`
	"CN-432" `		(additional fees not included)`
	"CN-433" `			- The oceans of Buccaneer Bay are full of jawless, fish-like creatures commonly known as Buccaneer Bay Boneheads that have a single, bone-like plate over their head and body, an oversized skull!`
	"CN-434" `			- Ecologically, they are commonly filter feeders, deposit feeders, and grazers, consuming tiny organisms or detritus from the water, sediment, or ocean floor.`
	"CN-435" `			- Dish Fish differ from other Buccaneer Bay Boneheads: they have a nearly perfectly circular head-plate, three small horns to fend off predators, and no eyes because they live on deep, low-light ocean floors.`
	"CN-436" `			- These traits make a Dish Fish head-plate the perfect souvenir dish: round, sealed, with a built-in tripod. Get yours today!`
	"CN-437" `	The waiter returns, and the plate is distinctive. He brings out a sizable ivory disc, the bone smooth and polished, balanced by three tapering horns on the table. On the plate itself sits a single charred tail, skewered and grilled until the skin crackles. It looks both impressive and appetizing.`
	"CN-438" `	(Take a bite.)`
	"CN-439" `	(Thank the waiter and leave.)`
	"CN-440" `	You take a bite. The meat is... an awful attempt at food. There's a musty, sulfurous note at the beginning, like wet compost, while beneath it is an almost-rotten tang that belies the visual freshness of the fish. The closest thing to a redeeming flavor is a faint, earthy aftertaste of salty mud.`
	"CN-441" `	The waiter comes to flick the Dish Fish clean with a rag, thanks you for patronizing the establishment, and jerks a thumb towards the door - a punctuated close to your 'meal of a lifetime.'`
	"CN-442" `The air in Delve's spaceport is crisp, carrying the mineral tang of weathered stone alongside occasional whiffs of fuel and lingering industrial cleaners. As you walk toward your ship, you notice teams of workers dressed in biohazard gear moving between the departing vessels in pairs, bulky sprayers strapped to their backs, nozzles hissing as they coat hulls in a fine mist. Each ship gets a thorough pass before takeoff, the workers checking crevices and landing gear with practiced efficiency.`
	"CN-443" `	(Ask them what they're doing.)`
	"CN-444" `	(Ignore them and continue on my way.)`
	"CN-445" `	"Shipworm outbreak?"`
	"CN-446" `	You approach a pair of workers as they finish spraying down a Bulk Freighter and ask what they're doing. One of them, a grizzled veteran with deep lines around his eyes, barely glances at you. "Shipworms," he mutters, already moving to the next ship.`
	"CN-447" `	The other, a younger worker practically bouncing in his boots, grins behind his respirator. "Yeah! Little metal-chewing pests. They're native to Delve, infest the mines, the shipyards - anywhere there's metal to sink their teeth into. If we didn't spray every ship before takeoff, they'd be all over the galaxy by now." The veteran sighs. "They already are all over the galaxy. Because people aren't careful enough."`
	"CN-448" `	The rookie ignores him. "They start as tiny worms, barely bigger than your pinky, but once they find metal, they melt into it, make a cocoon that looks just like part of the ship! Bombacle, we call 'em. Then BAM! A few months later, the casing bursts open like a bomb! Bombacle!"`
	"CN-449" `	The veteran shakes his head. "What he means is, they're an invasive hazard if they get off-world. That's why we spray. No shipworms, no problems."`
	"CN-450" `	The rookie gives his sprayer an enthusiastic shake. "And I get to torch every last one I find. You ever see one pop under a high-heat blast? Satisfying as hell." The veteran just mutters, "You'd think the novelty would wear off."`
	"CN-451" `	With another look at the freshly sprayed Bulk Freighter, you make a mental note to give your own ship a once-over before takeoff.`
	"CN-452" `	One of them, a seasoned veteran with weary eyes, lets out a long-suffering sigh. "Great. At least this one actually knows what they are." In contrast, the other - a fresh-faced worker brimming with energy - practically lights up. "They're like space barnacles - until they hatch into wormy bombs! I was just telling him how fun it is to fry 'em!"`
	"CN-453" `	The veteran gestures around at the cavernous spaceport. "We don't get outbreaks here. This is Delve. They're Delvan shipworms. They're native. Always have been. They infest the mines, the shipyards, anywhere with exposed metal. That's why every ship gets fumigated before takeoff - to keep 'em from spreading even more than they already have."`
	"CN-454" `	The rookie eagerly jumps back in. "You ever see one break out of a cocoon in real time? Casing splits and it blasts out like a grenade - it's wild!" The veteran just rubs his face.`
	"CN-455" `	With nothing more to add, you make a mental note to give your ship a once-over before takeoff as the workers continue their routine.`
	"CN-456" `	You give the fumigation teams a final glance and make your way back to your ship. The metallic surfaces around you now hint at unseen creatures lurking.`
	"CN-457" `You make your way through a dimly lit section of the spaceport to a near-empty hangar, where the usual hum of activity is dampened by an eerie stillness. The back of the hangar has a reinforced glass cargo door cracked open, perhaps by mistake. You peer inside to see large, sealed tarps stretched across the area, some draped over cargo crates, others covering entire sections. One enormous tarp appears big enough to be covering a whole ship. Each one bears the same stark warning in bold lettering: "DELVAN SHIPWORM FUMIGATION." The air has a faint chemical tang to it, and ahead, two figures move methodically between the tarps towards the door.`
	"CN-458" `	They are covered head to toe in protective suits, thick gloves, and respirators obscuring their faces. One carries a handheld sprayer, releasing a fine mist into the air, while the other checks a monitor strapped to their arm. Their boots crunch softly against the floor as they pass.`
	"CN-459" `	(Ask them what's going on.)`
	"CN-460" `	"Nasty little bombacles, aren't they?"`
	"CN-461" `	Curiosity gets the better of you, and you ask what this is all about, gesturing at the tarps. One of them pauses, their voice muffled by the respirator. "Delvan shipworm outbreak. Nasty infestation. We're exterminating them before they spread to other ships or the city." You can see small scorch marks on the floor nearby - signs of something being burned away.`
	"CN-462" `	"What's a Delvan shipworm?"`
	"CN-463" `	"Nasty bombacles, aren't they?"`
	"CN-464" `	"Well, good luck with that. I should get going."`
	"CN-465" `	The worker with the monitor barely hesitates before responding. "Delvan shipworms are an invasive species from Delve. They start as larvae, tiny worms-"`
	"CN-466" `	"Bombacles!" the one with the sprayer interjects, voice distorted through the respirator. "They latch on ships, grow into barnacles, then they're bombs!"`
	"CN-467" `	The first worker exhales, shaking their head. "They're more than that. The larvae attach to metal - usually ship hulls, but it can be mining equipment, or anything, really - and secrete an enzyme that corrodes the surface, breaking it down so they can form a cocoon around themselves. This builds up a high-pressure gas, so the outer shell hardens to compensate, blending in with the surrounding metal."`
	"CN-468" `	"Yeah, until - BOOM! Three months later, it blasts open like a grenade and out come a dozen disgusting worms!"`
	"CN-469" `	"You make it sound like a horror movie."`
	"CN-470" `	"It is a horror movie if you're next to one when it hatches." The sprayer-wielding worker turns back to you. "Writhing wrigglers that leave a hole the size of your palm in whatever they break out of. Plenty of ships have lost pressure 'cause of them."`
	"CN-471" `	The first worker sighs. "That's why we're dealing with it now. We don't let them spread, we don't get people vented into space."`
	"CN-472" `	Your gaze drifts back to the tarps, imagining what might be skittering beneath them. You nod in thanks and step away, making a mental note to double-check your ship's hull before takeoff.`
	"CN-473" `	The worker with the sprayer perks up. "Finally, someone who gets it!" they say, shaking their sprayer for emphasis.`
	"CN-474" `	The other groans. "They are not barnacles and they are not bombs. They are a highly adaptive invasive species with a complex-"`
	"CN-475" `	"Yeah, yeah, they're still bombacles," the sprayer worker cuts in. "Point is, we kill 'em before they kill ships. And cities. And people."`
	"CN-476" `	The monitor worker exhales but gives you a nod. "At least you understand how important this is. Most folks just walk by without a second thought." The sprayer worker waves you along. "Anyway, let us work before one of these things chews through something vital."`
	"CN-477" `	Satisfied, you leave them to their job, making a mental note to check your own hull before takeoff.`
	"CN-478" `	With one last glance at the fumigation tarps, you head back to your ship, suddenly aware of how fragile a metal hull can be in the wrong circumstances.`
	"CN-479" `You step to the edge of the mesa from the spaceport, the wind blowing as you take in the view. The canyons stretch out before you, a maze of red and gold stone, their depths lost in shadow. Far in the distance, something moves - small figures, barely more than specks, making their way through one of the ravines. You squint, but the details remain elusive.`
	"CN-480" `	Nearby, a weathered set of credit-operated binoculars stands bolted to the ground, a faded sign above them reading: 1 credit per use.`
	"CN-481" `	(Take a closer look for 1 credit.)`
	"CN-482" `	(Ignore the specks and return to my ship.)`
	"CN-483" `	(Pat my empty pockets and return to my ship as I can't even afford the 1 credit fee.)`
	"CN-484" `	The binoculars hum as you focus in on the figures, expecting hikers, but what you see is something else entirely. A small group of shaggy, long-limbed creatures move carefully through the canyon. Their fur is the same hue as the sandstone, blending almost perfectly with the terrain. They walk on two legs, but with a hunched, cautious gait, pausing often to glance around before continuing.`
	"CN-485" `	One of them stops near a boulder, kneeling to scoop up a handful of dust and let it run through its fingers, as if testing the wind. Another lingers behind the rest, turning its head slightly, perhaps listening for something. There are no signs of tools or fire - certainly nothing to suggest the "canyon people" of local legend - but there's an undeniable sense of awareness in the way they move and seem to belong to the landscape itself.`
	"CN-486" `	After a long moment, they disappear behind a ridge, their camouflage making it hard to tell if they were ever there at all. You step back from the binoculars, the last glimpse of them lingering in your mind.`
	"CN-487" `	Curiosity gets the better of you, and you pay a credit to the machine. The binoculars whir softly as they adjust, bringing the distant canyon into focus. A group of brightly dressed tourists walk along a winding trail, pointing at rock formations and stopping to take photos. One of them waves excitedly at something - maybe an unseen guide explaining the landscape.`
	"CN-488" `	Just another tour group exploring the canyons. You step back from the binoculars with a small chuckle.`
	"CN-489" `You step off your ship and wander around Bluestone's quiet yet functional spaceport. The buildings, made mostly of durable plastic resin, form a quaint but near-uniform red-brown landscape, in sharp contrast to the small yellow pub in the center. The spaceport is quiet, but the low hum of activity from a nearby oil drill gives it some life. As you are entering the pub, you spot an announcement on a bulletin board:`
	"CN-490" `	"Guided Tour: Hybrid Crop Research Village - an exceptional hub of field-based research led by the Cornucopia College of Agriculture, nestled within captivating landscapes!"`
	"CN-491" `	The bulletin catches your eye. It's a rare chance to see something other than refinery equipment and plastics, and the mention of hybrid crops entails something different. There's a signup sheet, and only a few spots remain.`
	"CN-492" `	(Sign up.)`
	"CN-493" `	(Skip the tour.)`
	"CN-494" `	After signing up for the next tour, you are directed to hop onto a beat-up old bus that rattles along to the research village. You notice Bluestone's rusty industrial sprawl transition into the rocky fields of deep, desaturated blue grasses that the planet is known for. The village itself appears a small yet dynamic community, centered around a sleek, glass-paneled laboratory and greenhouse emanating reddish-yellow light. Dotted around are modest plastic resin apartment buildings. The entire community is surrounded by an expansive field containing rows and rows of crops.`
	"CN-495" `	You get off the bus and are immediately ushered into the laboratory by a young-looking tour guide, along with half a dozen other tourists. She has a small nametag that reads:`
	"CN-496" `		Zea S.`
	"CN-497" `		Community Tour Guide`
	"CN-498" `		MS in Agronomy`
	"CN-499" `		Cornucopia College of Agriculture`
	"CN-500" `	"Welcome to our guided tour of Bluestone's Hybrid Crop Research Village! Here, our dedicated scientists harness the secrets of native flora. The grasses and lichens you see around you have evolved unique photosynthetic pigments to thrive in our planet's dim, reddish light. Before we continue, can anyone name the most famous photosynthetic pigment found on Earth?"`
	"CN-501" `	"Tea leaves."`
	"CN-502" `	"Green."`
	"CN-503" `	"Chlorophyll."`
	"CN-504" `	"Purple paint."`
	"CN-505" `	(Remain silent.)`
	"CN-506" `	"That's what I use to paint my dragon minis!" a tourist blurts out, his excitement briefly overtaking him before he immediately clears his throat to regain his composure.`
	"CN-507" `	Zea shifts uneasily. "Umm, not exactly. The answer I was looking for was chlorophyll.`
	"CN-508" `	Zea beams broadly. "Exactly right! Chlorophyll is fundamental to life on Earth.`
	"CN-509" `	There is an awkward pause as Zea scans the group. After another moment the tour guide sighs lightly, "Well, it's chlorophyll." Visibly trying to downplay the moment, she adds, "No worries - let's move on.`
	"CN-510" `	"These pigments on our native plants are distinct from Earth's chlorophyll. Green chlorophyll actually captures red light fairly well, but not as well as a cyan pigment. Our planet's reddish hue can also be deceiving - near-infrared light, an invisible light just beyond what humans can see, is what our native plants truly thrive on. The vegetation can capture those wavelengths of light with remarkable efficiency. By deciphering their genetic blueprints, we've identified key adaptations that can be hybridized into crops found on Earth or other worlds to enhance their resilience in the low-light environments of cooler stars."`
	"CN-511" `	You are then led outside to a small garden of native grasses and lichens next to the laboratory. "And now, take a closer look at our fascinating native species. Notice their muted blue and near-black colors - this isn't just a quirk of nature, but a vital adaptation that enhances absorption of red and near-infrared light on our dim planet. Their extensive root systems delve deep into the sparse soil, allowing them to efficiently access as much nutrients and water as possible under low-light conditions. Now, the leaves on these grasses are much larger and flatter than what you'd see on similar grasses on planets with brighter sunlight. Can anyone tell me why our plants might have larger and flatter leaves than somewhere like Earth?"`
	"CN-512" `	"Larger leaves maximize surface area to capture more light."`
	"CN-513" `	"They look nicer in the breeze."`
	"CN-514" `	"It helps herbivores leaf them alone."`
	"CN-515" `	(Say nothing.)`
	"CN-516" `	A collective groan ripples through the tour group, punctuated by a couple of reluctant chuckles. Zea remains completely oblivious as she continues with the tour.`
	"CN-517" `	"Ummm, actually, that's not quite right. The main focus of these larger leaves is to maximize surface area for better light absorption."`
	"CN-518" `	"Exactly right! They maximize surface area for better light absorption, which is crucial on our dim planet. Great answer!"`
	"CN-519" `	The guide makes eye contact with most of the group for an uncomfortable beat as she awaits a response. When none come, the tour guide says, "Well, it's because larger, thinner leaves maximize the surface area for light absorption... ummm, let's look at some grasses now."`
	"CN-520" `	She walks up to one of the grasses and gesture at its leaves. "The large, thin leaves of our native plants are designed to maximize surface area to better collect infrared rays, ensuring they capture every photon they can. These features collectively enable our plants to thrive where Earth plants would struggle."`
	"CN-521" `	The tour continues as you enter a state-of-the-art greenhouse. Inside, hybrid crops flourish under controlled lighting that varies from yellow to red, as you feel warm from the heat lamps above. Zea points at a deep pot filled with a muted blue-black wheatgrass that has huge, delicate leaves. "Here, traditional Earth crops like wheat have been endowed with traits inspired by our native species. Observe the broader, darker leaves that boost photosynthetic efficiency in low-light conditions. These modifications not only help the plants harness energy from our reddish sunlight, but can be used across the galaxy to grow food where it was impossible before!"`
	"CN-522" `	You feel the tour drawing to a close as the tour guide gathers the group for a final discussion.`
	"CN-523" `	"Thank you for joining us on this exploration of the cutting edge of hybrid crops. I hope you leave here today with a renewed appreciation and curiosity for the foods you eat and the remarkable plants that surround us."`
	"CN-524" `	(Clap.)`
	"CN-525" `	(Do nothing.)`
	"CN-526" `	You begin clapping and the room fills with applause as the other tourists join in. Zea smiles warmly, "Thank you all again, and have a wonderful day!"`
	"CN-527" `	The silence lingers a little too long. Zea waits another moment, then nods to herself a few times before quietly walking off.`
	"CN-528" `	With the tour's ending, you board the same beat-up old bus that brought you here. As the bus lurches back towards the copper-colored resin of the spaceport, you have time to take in the rolling fields of blue-black grasses swaying under the dim, reddish suns of Bluestone.`
	"CN-529" `As you wander through a row of half-demolished hangars, you spot clusters of spiny cacti with flat, rounded pads and bright red fruit growing in the rubble. A local, noticing your curiosity, strides over with a wry grin.`
	"CN-530" `	"That plant over there? That's a prickly pear cactus. They're from right here on Geyser. Hardy things, too - they're so aggressive they've even taken root all over Earth."`
	"CN-531" `	"That doesn't sound right. They're native to Earth, not Geyser."`
	"CN-532" `	"Huh. Okay then."`
	"CN-533" `	The local nods, satisfied. "Glad you can appreciate the local plants. Have a good one." They head off towards the food court.`
	"CN-534" `	"You tourists think you know everything. What are you, a plant scientist?"`
	"CN-535" `	"A botanist?"`
	"CN-536" `	"Oh no, I'm no scientist."`
	"CN-537" `	"Bah!" With a dismissive wave, they storm off, cursing tourists under their breath.`
	"CN-538" `You step into one of the raucous open-air marketplaces of Bloodsea, where armed vendors and hulking guards barter over stolen cargo amid piles of weathered crates. As you weave through the maze of noise and color, you catch sight of a man huddled behind one of the crates - he's coughing violently, blood staining his lips, the crate, and the ground beside him. Before you can react, a lean, scarred woman fixes her steely gaze on you, her face hidden beneath a pair of stained bandanas - one concealing her mouth and nose, the other wrapped around her head.`
	"CN-539" `You step into one of the raucous open-air marketplaces of Bloodsea, where wary-looking vendors and armed guards barter over allegedly legal cargo amid piles of weathered crates. As you weave through the maze of noise and color, you catch sight of a man huddled behind one of the crates - he's coughing violently, blood staining his lips, the crate, and the ground beside him. Before you can react, a lean, scarred woman fixes her steely gaze on you, her face hidden beneath a pair of stained bandanas - one concealing her mouth and nose, the other wrapped around her head.`
	"CN-540" `	"That man's got the Bloodsea Bloom," she says flatly, as if mentioning the weather.`
	"CN-541" `	"What's that?"`
	"CN-542" `	(Get back to my ship.)`
	"CN-543" `	She scoffs and leans in, her voice dropping to a rough whisper. "The red tide. Every summer, the bloody sea blooms, fills the air with nasty, toxic bits that chew up your lungs if you catch a whiff. No local goes near the beach when the bloom's ablooming."`
	"CN-544" `	Then, she suddenly screams, "Only offworlders and blind fools with a death wish swim in that poison!"`
	"CN-545" `	A wry grin floods her face, and she adds in a conversational tone, almost as an afterthought, "Now, I'll flay you alive and turn you into chum if you don't buy some fish bait. Eight racks." She slams a scarred hand into a rancid barrel beside her.`
	"CN-546" `	(Give her 80,000 credits for the barrel of rotten fish bait.)`
	"CN-547" `	(Give her 8,000 credits for the barrel of rotten fish bait.)`
	"CN-548" `	(Give her 800 credits for the barrel of rotten fish bait.)`
	"CN-549" `	(Run for it.)`
	"CN-550" `	You grit your teeth against the stench and fight back the urge to gag as you fumble over the credits to the gnarled woman. She suppresses an amused glint in her eye and, with surprising care, gently pushes the putrid barrel towards you, her calloused fingers brushing the rim in a brief, elegant flourish. You bow your head in gratitude, roll it away, and once she's out of sight, ditch the barrel and dart back to the <ship>, leaving behind a grim and grimy reminder of this unruly port.`
	"CN-551" `	You grit your teeth against the stench and fight back the urge to gag as you fumble over the credits to the gnarled woman. With an irritated snort, she shoves the putrid barrel towards you, and you quickly roll it away. Once she's out of sight, you ditch the barrel and dart back to the <ship>, leaving behind a grim and grimy reminder of this unruly port.`
	"CN-552" `	You grit your teeth against the stench and fight back the urge to gag as you fumble over the credits to the gnarled woman. Her nostrils flare, and she snatches to credits with a snarl. "Not even one rack," she spits, eyes blazing. Without warning, she hauls the barrel off the ground to slam it directly against your shin. You yelp and stagger backwards. She rakes a jagged knife through the air, roaring, "I'll carve you like a cod and string your entrails for the gulls!" You flee her and the barrel to dart back to the <ship>, her furious curses echoing behind you.`
	"CN-553" `	You race through the maze of weathered crates and guarded stalls. As you push past the chaotic crowd toward the safety of your <model>, the woman's bellowing laughter - a harsh, unbridled roar of contempt - echoes in your ears.`
	"CN-554" `You trudge through the biting wind to a weathered spaceport bar, its exterior marked by signs proclaiming "No Gods, No Masters," and "No Cybernetic Implants. No Badgers, Weasels, Or Polecats." Inside, the air is heavy with shadow and smoke - worn wood panels, dim, flickering lights, and cluttered signs declaring even more peculiar prohibitions. Slouched in a corner by the heavy door, an old man sits silently, his half-lidded eyes watching the drunken banter and clinking glasses. You could approach him, and perhaps press for answers about the bar's odd proclamations.`
	"CN-555" `	"Why no 'Cybernetic Implants'?"`
	"CN-556" `	"What's the deal with 'Badgers'?"`
	"CN-557" `	"Turnips?"`
	"CN-558" `	"What's wrong with 'Weasels'?"`
	"CN-559" `	"What about 'Polecats'?"`
	"CN-560" `	"Albatross?"`
	"CN-561" `	(Thank him for the answers and leave.)`
	"CN-562" `	(Turn around and leave.)`
	"CN-563" `	The old man grunts, leaning forward so that his voice drops to a rough whisper. "Cybernetic implants ain't allowed 'round here - always cheat at cards. Can't trust a rigged hand when fate's supposed to be fair!"`
	"CN-564" `	He pauses, then mutters simply, "Turnips."`
	"CN-565" `	He explodes. "Badgers! They'll dig up every last turnip I grow, ruining my patch faster than a cyborg cleans house. Nothing but trouble!"`
	"CN-566" `	It's unclear how he expects you to respond.`
	"CN-567" `	He snorts dismissively. "Weasels, now, they're just tiny polecats scampering about like mischief incarnate - ain't worth their salt, and worse, troublemakers by nature!"`
	"CN-568" `	His face darkens, and his voice grows weighty and ominous. "Polecats, they attract... the Albatross." For a suspended moment, the chatter ceases; the clamor of glasses and low murmurs fall silent as every patron registers the weight of that word. Then, as if on cue, the noise resumes, and the hubbub goes on as usual.`
	"CN-569" `	That single word slices through the renewed din, and in a heartbeat, the atmosphere shatters. Several patrons rise from their stools, their expressions hardening into threatening scowls. The old man, eyes distant and vacant, seems lost in thought while it becomes clear that you have crossed a forbidden line.`
	"CN-570" `	Rough hands grip your shoulders, and before you can protest, you're dragged toward the door. Outside, in the biting wind, the echo of their shouted threats follows you. Perhaps some stones are best left unturned.`
	"CN-571" `You step down onto the landing pad and your breath makes a white halo. The spaceport is unusually foggy, and the chilling wind causes a reflexive shiver to run up the base of your neck.`
	"CN-572" `	A grizzled man emerges from the fog with an easy, unhurried gait, a laser rifle slung over one shoulder. A hulking beast lumbers at his side: a horse-sized hound cloaked in heavy, wooly fur rimmed with frost. Two enormous tusks thrust from its muzzle like pale sabers. Steam billows from its flared nostrils as it turns its head almost lazily toward you. Its eyes carry a grim patience.`
	"CN-573" `	The man sees you and grunts, "Don't stare at a Mammoth Mastiff."`
	"CN-574" `	"What's a Mammoth Mastiff?"`
	"CN-575" `	"Don't tell me what to do!"`
	"CN-576" `	(Avert my gaze and get back to my ship.)`
	"CN-577" `	"A phantom from harsher times, bred on Hestia when it was still lifeless ice. Now nothing more than a tool of the trade." He pats the creature and it lets out a low rumble.`
	"CN-578" `	The man bellows a deep laugh as the fog thickens. The creature's eyes are the last things to pierce the haze before man and mastiff alike fade away. You find yourself alone once more.`
	"CN-579" `You steady yourself on the floating city-ship as the necklace of barges, docks, and gantries creak and sway under the influence of Mainsail's endless ocean waves. Salt spray stings your face as you head out towards the ring. One barge rocks close, its deck slick with algae, while a local fearlessly walks a four-legged whale-like creature on a leash - a seal-sized mass of compact muscle under slate fur, with webbed paws that click on the planks, a long whiskered snout bristling with needlelike teeth and a broad, flattened tail that wags with anticipation.`
	"CN-580" `	The local catches you gawking, flashes a salt-creased grin and calls, "Never seen a seadog before?`
	"CN-581" `	"Can't say I have!"`
	"CN-582" `	"What is that thing?"`
	"CN-583" `	"Of course I've seen a seadog before!"`
	"CN-584" `	"Ah, that, my friend, is a Mainsail Seadog, the premier water-sporting hound of the Paradise Planets. Bred some four centuries ago in the ateliers of this very planet, they marry old water-dog stock with dolphin and otter blood, with a touch of beaver for the tail, crocodile for the jaws, and barracuda for the strike," he says with a wink. "They'll nose out a school, haul in the finest fish, and lay a damp, grateful head upon your boots - a prized rarity since the Republic put a lid on the gene labs."`
	"CN-585" `	"Glad to hear that, my friend! Too few have seen the prized rarity of a Mainsail Seadog nowadays, since the Republic put a lid on the labs."`
	"CN-586" `	With a practiced motion he hops from the barge into a sleek, unpowered skiff. The seadog slips from the barge like a ribbon, dives cleanly into the sea, and sets its broad tail to the waves. In a spray of salt the steely creature hauls them off, and the boat recedes like a chariot of Poseidon into the harbor haze.`
	"CN-587" `As you walk from the spaceport's landing pads towards the center of the village, your attention is caught by a worn-down sign pointing you to the "Kleinwean Bezirk."`
	"CN-588" `	(Follow the sign.)`
	"CN-589" `	(Ignore the sign and keep walking.)`
	"CN-590" `	Curious, you decide to investigate, turning into a narrow street that feels like an echo of Old Vienna. A handful of historic-looking buildings line the cobblestone path, their facades adorned with dramatic stonework and flowery tilework. A small concert hall, labeled "Bach Collegium Konzertsaal", hums with the faint sound of string instruments tuning. Nearby, the aroma of rich, chocolatey coffee drifts from a small coffeehouse.`
	"CN-591" `	Outside the coffeehouse, a man at a marble table sips his coffee while reading a local newspaper. You can see the front page with the headline: "Mitreibender Mozart mit dem Bach Collegium Konzertsaal", featuring a photograph of a smiling conductor at the center of a small orchestra. On the reader's plate rests a bright pink sponge cake, its color fitting right in with the rich tones of the street.`
	"CN-592" `	As you linger, a well-dressed older woman approaches. Her voice, imbued with a musical rhythm, greets you with a hearty "Gruess Gott!`
	"CN-593" `	"Not many offworld visit Kleinwean, which is a shame, as you can see it's quite the New Austrian 'gem'," she remarks with a wink. "I was on my way to the concert - my husband is sick - and I would hate for his ticket to go to waste. Would you do me the honor of taking it?"`
	"CN-594" `	(Accept the ticket.)`
	"CN-595" `	(Politely decline.)`
	"CN-596" `	You graciously accept the invitation and follow her to the intimate concert hall. Despite its modest size, the hall houses a full orchestra. Once you're comfortably seated, the conductor steps forward, clears his throat, and in a measured tone declares:`
	"CN-597" `	"Willkommen im ehrwuerdigen Bach Collegium Konzertsaal! Wir sind Lichtjahre von Mozarts Heimat entfernt, aber auch im Zentrum von Kleinwean! Geniessen Sie das Konzert!"`
	"CN-598" `	The words hang in the air as you notice the conductor's smile, strikingly familiar from the newspaper photograph. With his invitation to lose yourself in the performance still echoing, the orchestra begins a stirring rendition of Mozart. The notes dance through the air with crystalline clarity, and you even recognize one or two of the melodies, each serving as a bridge to the Old Vienna of Earth.`
	"CN-599" `	Even after the performance, you feel the sound of music resonate in your bones as you glance back one more time at New Austria's hidden cultural enclave.`
	"CN-600" `	You thank her kindly but explain that you're not in the mood for a concert. She nods understandingly, her eyes softening with disappointed yet gracious acceptance. You finish your exploration of the "Kleinwean Bezirk", absorbing the ambiance of the cobblestone street as the scents of coffee mingle with the sound of music.`
	"CN-601" `	With the atmosphere steeped in nostalgia for a distant city on a distant world long past, you return to your ship.`
	"CN-602" `As your ship settles down on landing pad A5B, two young adults approach. One speaks up, "Hello, Captain. Have you seen a woman named Anna Fangvin anywhere? She was last seen in the spaceport, and must have left in someone's spaceship."`
	"CN-603" `	Around the spaceport you see a few other groups doing the same thing. Anna may have been more popular than she thought.`
	"CN-604" `	"She went to another star system a long ways from here. You won't be able to get to her."`
	"CN-605" `	"No, I don't know. Sorry."`
	"CN-606" `	"If you ever see her again, tell her that the Coalition of Book Enjoyers appreciates her work. It wouldn't be possible for you to bring us to her location?" You respond in the negative, and the two go off to the other groups to spread the news.`
	"CN-607" `	Posters hang on many of the spaceport's walls - here too, Anna's books must have been famous. The posters read:`
	"CN-608" `	MISSING:`
	"CN-609" `		Anna Fangvin, a young author whose books have been shared throughout the planet. Please report any news to the Coalition of Book Enjoyers, address 5662 Myrtle Lane, Sizertown, Zug.`
	"CN-610" `	(Check it out.)`
	"CN-611" `	(Skip the race.)`
	"CN-612" `	The screen above flashes race details:`
	"CN-613" `		<racename>: &[race length] Hour Race`
	"CN-614" `		Today's Racers:`
	"CN-615" `		Megaparsec Racing Technologies: <megaparsec name>`

	"CN-617" `		Delta V Grand Prix: <delta name>`
	"CN-618" `		Deep Sky Dynamics: <deep name>`
	"CN-619" `	(Watch the race.)`
	"CN-620" `	(Ask someone for an overview of hover racing.)`
	"CN-621" `	(Use my ship to scan the racers.)`
	"CN-622" `	"Hovercraft racing pits four ships against the clock - each trying to log as many laps as possible. The race is between three and five hours long and is split into two phases: an initial afterburn for a burst of speed, followed by laps completed in the remaining time.`
	"CN-623" `	"Each racer has a roughly equal chance of victory, though Megaparsec Racing Technologies tends to win a bit more often overall. Megaparsec also excels in longer races thanks to their efficient ion engines that can do up to twelve laps an hour, but completely lack any initial speed burst. Deep racers shine on shorter stints by using high-powered atomics for a powerful start that can push them to complete up to eighteen laps in the first hour, but they tend to perform much worse in longer races due to their lack of efficiency. The other two teams fall somewhere in between.`
	"CN-624" `	"Even though each team is roughly equal, in a given race, a savvy watcher can better predict a winner by knowing which teams perform better on shorter or longer race lengths, or a less sporting one with a powerful scanner might even be able to tell a hovercraft's exact level of afterburner fuel before the race even begins.`
	"CN-625" `	"One last tip to remember - they say the surest way to make a small fortune in hovercraft racing is to start with a big one!" The fan's speech ends with a hearty laugh, whose sound mixes with the roar of engines inside the <racename>.`
	"CN-626" `	Your ship is close enough to the <racename>'s track to be able to scan exactly how many laps each hovercraft's afterburner can take them. Your ship relays the following afterburner data:`
	"CN-627" `		Megaparsec Racing Technologies: No afterburner fuel`
	"CN-628" `		Syndicate Performance Racing: &[syndicate boost] laps worth of afterburner fuel`
	"CN-629" `		Delta V Grand Prix: &[delta boost] laps worth of afterburner fuel`
	"CN-630" `		Deep Sky Dynamics: &[deep boost] laps worth of afterburner fuel`
	"CN-631" `	They edge out the competition in a photo-finish, securing the win by a razor-thin margin.`
	"CN-632" `	They clinch victory in a breathtaking display, only a single lap ahead of the field.`
	"CN-633" `	They rocket to an unrivaled lead in the race's last few minutes, ending the race with a clear, commanding advantage.`
	"CN-634" `	They surge ahead, their craft a blur of power and precision, leaving rivals in their wake by multiple laps to finish the race in a clear victory.`
	"CN-635" `	They dominate the competition with an astonishing double-digit lap lead to cross the finish line in an overwhelming triumph.`
	"CN-636" `	The other three teams bundle together, never separated by more than two laps in the last-minute sprint for second place.`
	"CN-637" `	The rest cluster together fairly tightly for an eventful end to the race.`
	"CN-638" `	The mid-field hovercraft finish the race in a loose grouping over half a dozen laps apart.`
	"CN-639" `	The remaining racers finish uneventfully spread out, the order stretched across close to a dozen laps.`
	"CN-640" `	Only three racers finish today: one crashed off the track, the driver lucky to escape unharmed.`
	"CN-641" `	Final results:`
	"CN-642" `		Megaparsec Racing Technologies: <megaparsec name>, &[megaparsec speed] laps completed`
	"CN-643" `		Syndicate Performance Racing: <syndicate name>, &[syndicate laps] laps completed`

	"CN-645" `		Deep Sky Dynamics: <deep name>, &[deep laps] laps completed`
	"CN-646" `As you turn to leave a food stand in the spaceport, a rather young man in activewear waves you over to a bench off to the side of the main drag.`
	"CN-647" `	(Go over to him.)`
	"CN-648" `	(Keep walking.)`
	"CN-649" `	When you go to ignore him he gives a quick, sharp, whistle and briefly flashes a Deep Security badge at you. He immediately covers this with a friendly wave for any nearby eyes, but it is clear that he won't be ignored.`
	"CN-650" `	When you approach the bench he says, "Hello captain. Please, have a seat and allow me to take a moment of your time."`
	"CN-651" `	His manner is very rehearsed, but he seems quite intent and assured in his request.`
	"CN-652" `	"Sure. Who are you?"`
	"CN-653" `	"Sorry, but I'm busy right now."`
	"CN-654" `	"To be clear, I'm here to thank you, if that helps." he says.`
	"CN-655" `	"Oh. What is it?" (Sit down.)`
	"CN-656" `	"Sorry, maybe next time."`
	"CN-657" `	As you sit down, the man smiles at you before directing his attention back to those passing by as he speaks. "My name is Wayde, Agent Wayde if you will. Don't mind the title though, I... well I work in the logistics division for Deep Security. You've transported a large number of secure packages recently, and several of them were mine."`
	"CN-658" `	"If it pays, it pays."`
	"CN-659" `	"Ah, yes."`
	"CN-660" `	"Do all the secure packages belong to Deep Security?"`
	"CN-661" `	"Oh no, plenty of tech businesses and wealthy individuals use the same secure package shipping channels. We do monitor all of them though just to make sure our own channels don't get compromised by something ill-advised... or illegal." He shrugs, giving you a measured look.`
	"CN-662" `	"Well, I looked at your record and it seems you've done quite a lot for the Deep, and you're well-regarded. We like to keep a list of pilots that we can call on if we need something delivered with either urgency or discretion, and it seems like you qualified. You passed the background check at any rate.`
	"CN-663" `	"So at any rate, I'm authorized to give you a one-time offer to join that list. Don't worry, I'm not asking anything of you right now."`
	"CN-664" `	He stops keeping an eye on passers-by for a moment to look directly at you. "So, are you interested?"`
	"CN-665" `	"I'm willing to help."`
	"CN-666" `	"Sorry, but I don't think I want to get that involved."`
	"CN-667" `	"You said 'at any rate' twice."`
	"CN-668" `	His expression twitches slightly but he carries on with a chuckle. "Er, good catch. The question stands though."`
	"CN-669" `	"Excellent," he says, standing up and stretching as if concluding a friendly conversation. He turns back to you with a smile, "I'll add you to the list as soon as I get back to the office then. Your ID will also let you see which packages are ours specifically too. Oh, and again, thank you!"`
	"CN-670" `	Agent Wayde appears to flick a subtle salute your direction, or perhaps merely tips an imaginary cap. "Good day, captain. I look forward to working with you in the future."`
	"CN-671" `	With a quick motion he flicks his hair back out his eyes and jogs away, sending one last wave your direction just before he turns a corner and disappears.`
	"CN-672" `Strolling through the spaceport, you are suddenly accosted by a young and breathless woman. "Please, Captain," she wheezes, "I'm so glad I caught you."`
	"CN-673" `	After drawing in a deep breath, she stands up straighter and gestures to someone some distance away. "Captain, I'm sorry, but my colleague Julie and I are in dire need of urgent transport. Can you help?"`
	"CN-674" `	As she catches her breath some more, her older colleague hustles over, bags in tow.`
	"CN-675" `	"Sure, I'd be glad to help."`
	"CN-676" `	"Where do you need to go?"`
	"CN-677" `	"Why is it so urgent?"`
	"CN-678" `	"Who are you?"`
	"CN-679" `	Julie holds out her hand in greeting. "Apologies, let's do this properly. My name is Julie Gillar. My assistant and I were held back with our duties and missed our booked transport. We're in dire need of passage to Valhalla for several important business meetings, but unfortunately everything is booked up for the next five days straight, and that's just not acceptable to my employer."`
	"CN-680" `	"Who's your employer?"`
	"CN-681" `	Julie furtively glances at the people nearby. "Well, I have a few employers actually, but at the moment, indirectly, Deep Security."`
	"CN-682" `	She leans in slightly closer and lowers her voice. "We have access to their list of trustworthy pilots for emergencies. You'll be paid quite well."`
	"CN-683" `	"I'm sorry, but I really can't help you right now."`
	"CN-684" `	"Lead right on then," says Julie. You point towards your ship, and the women move to board it.`
	"CN-685" `Julie and her assistant are model passengers the entire journey. As she prepares to disembark, she thanks you for your assistance. In addition to transferring <payment> into your account, she helps you change your job board preferences with the local spaceport agencies to make yourself available for business passengers consulting with Deep Security.`
	"CN-686" `	"Thank you Captain <last>, you've been most helpful. Do keep an eye out in the spaceports around here though. Deep Security is notorious for keeping us longer than we're booked for. There's often someone stuck and in need of rapid transport off-world."`
	"CN-687" `You are approached by a man in a Deep Security uniform who asks if you would be willing to escort a few freighters to <stopovers> and back by <day>. "We would normally have our own fleet do it," he says, "but we're short on available ships given certain circumstances."`
	"CN-688" `	"Sure, I can do that."`
	"CN-689" `	"Sorry, but I won't be traveling in that direction any time soon."`
	"CN-690" `	"Good. Before you leave, know that there may be pirate forces waiting for you in Alphard, Sirius, and Altair. You can try to avoid them, but make sure you get the freighters back on time."`
	"CN-691" `	The Deep Security officer wishes you good luck and walks off, leaving you to wonder how he knows where pirate fleets might be waiting for you.`
	"CN-692" `A Deep Security officer greets you when you return to <planet> with the freighters. The officer hands you <payment> and thanks you for accepting the job on such short notice. "We'll make sure to contact you in the future should we need your help. If you want to help us further at the moment, I suggest you check the job boards in the Deep for mystery delivery and retrieval jobs."`
	"CN-693" `As you are walking through the spaceport, a woman in a Deep Security uniform stops you. "You're Captain <last>, correct?" You nod. "Would you be willing to transport a handful of freighters to <stopovers> to pick up some cargo? We'd need them to return here by <day>. Normally this kind of job would be done by Deep Security, but we have no ships to spare at the moment."`
	"CN-694" `	"Thank you, Captain. Before you go, I need to inform you that you may encounter pirate fleets near Tania Australis, Muphrid, and Ascella, and you might not have time to go around these systems."`
	"CN-695" `	The Deep Security officer wishes you good luck and walks off, leaving you to wonder how she knows where pirate fleets might be waiting for you.`
	"CN-696" `A Deep Security officer approaches you when you enter the spaceport and asks if you would be able to do a job for the Deep. "We're short on Deep Security ships at the moment, but we need three Behemoths escorted to <stopovers>. After they pick up the cargo, bring them back here by <day>."`
	"CN-697" `	"Much appreciated, Captain. And for your well-being as well as that of the cargo, you must know that there may be pirates waiting in Algieba, Cor Caroli, and Wei. Behemoths are tough ships, so you should be able to travel through those systems and not slow yourself down by taking alternative routes."`
	"CN-698" `A Deep Security officer calls your name and approaches you as you enter the spaceport's central market. "Greetings, Captain <last>, I'm Lieutenant Paris. Would you be interested in conducting some more work for the Deep? We are currently in need of a few extra ships to assist in an ongoing situation."`
	"CN-699" `	"I'd love to help. What's the situation?"`
	"CN-700" `	"Sorry, but I can't help right now."`
	"CN-701" `	"Whatever plans you have, I suggest you change them, as this is an urgent situation."`
	"CN-702" `	"Okay, I'll help. What is the situation?"`
	"CN-703" `	"Then I can't help you. Sorry."`
	"CN-704" `	"Excellent. I'm sure that you are aware that much of Deep Security is currently preoccupied, hence why we have been recruiting merchants to escort many of the Deep's convoys. The reason this is the case is that we have been attempting to detain a particularly meddlesome pirate warlord who goes by the name of 'Beelzebub.' From what we can ascertain, Beelzebub has extensive knowledge on the inner workings of Deep Security, which is making tracking him down rather difficult, as he seems to know our every move. That is where you and a few other merchants come in."`
	"CN-705" `	Paris reaches into his pocket and pulls out a bag. Inside of the bag are at least two dozen of the mysterious cubes that you have transported in the past, only with one distinct difference: a thick red streak running down the middle of each cube.`
	"CN-706" `	"The Deep requires that you place these on a number of worlds in the Dirt Belt which I will mark on your map for you. Place at least four of these devices around the spaceport of each marked planet, then come to <destination> where I will collect any remaining cubes that you may have. If a Deep Security ship did this then it would likely catch the attention of any pirates in the system and that information would make its way to Beelzebub, but random merchants should be inconspicuous enough to throw Beelzebub off our trail. Is that clear?"`
	"CN-707" `	"Crystal clear, Lieutenant. I will prepare to leave shortly."`
	"CN-708" `	"What do these cubes do?"`
	"CN-709" `	"I don't believe that I am authorized to tell you that. Just know that they will help us catch Beelzebub."`
	"CN-710" `	"Understood. I'll place the cubes for you."`
	"CN-711" `	"This feels too secretive for me. I don't want to help anymore."`
	"CN-712" `You find Lieutenant Paris waiting for you in the spaceport. You hand him the bag of remaining cubes, and he hands you <payment> for helping.`
	"CN-713" `	"Is there anything else that you need me to do?"`
	"CN-714" `	"Are you able to tell me what the cubes are for?"`
	"CN-715" `	Paris takes a moment to pause before responding. "They're sensor devices. They are used to track the movement of pirate fleets, but they are almost useless alone; dozens could be needed in a single system to track entire fleets. The ones that I gave you were fine-tuned though, designed to only detect the ship that we know that Beelzebub is using. That is all that I am allowed to tell you, at least for the time being."`
	"CN-716" `	"Not at the moment, Captain, but I'll contact you should anything else arise."`
	"CN-717" `A pair of men in Navy uniforms escort you to a restricted area of the Luna facility. One of them uses a keycard to open an elevator and ushers you in. The elevator opens up many floors below the spaceport, to an area of the facility that looks far newer than that on the surface.`
	"CN-718" `	You are kept in what looks like a waiting room along with five others. After a bit of talking, you find out that these are the other merchant captains who helped place the cubes across different regions of the galaxy.`
	"CN-719" `	An hour of waiting passes, and Lieutenant Paris walks into the room followed by a Navy admiral. "I hope you are all enjoying your stay," the admiral remarks. "Now. How is it that most of the cubes you placed were mysteriously disabled shortly after pirates entered each system?"`
	"CN-720" `	The admiral looks to each of the captains in the room, seemingly waiting for a response.`
	"CN-721" `	"Maybe they know how to detect the cubes."`
	"CN-722" `	The admiral looks at you. "Doubtful." Paris nods, as if to back up this claim.`
	"CN-723" `	He clears his throat and continues, "Allow me to explain the situation. Roughly two weeks after the last of your 'deliveries' were activated, the sensors identified Beelzebub's ship in the northern reaches of the Dirt Belt. We dispatched half of the nearest Navy garrison to apprehend the vessel, only to arrive and find a convoy of Star Barges instead.`
	"CN-724" `	"Worse, while our ships were in pursuit of the decoys, a pirate fleet managed to assault their home base and captured a handful of docked Cruisers. And, amidst the chaos, most of the cubes you placed in the Dirt Belt and Core were disabled!"`
	"CN-725" `	Before the admiral can work himself up further, Paris intercedes with the rest of the story. "The cubes that Deep Security had you position on multiple worlds were surveillance devices - sensor cubes, as we call them - designed to track Beelzebub's ship and notify us when the ship was located. It can be presumed that Beelzebub now has access to these cubes and has undoubtedly converted them to work in his favor. It may take us weeks to retrieve them, but at the moment it can be assumed that Beelzebub knows where we will be."`
	"CN-726" `	"Why are you involving us in this?"`
	"CN-727" `	"Are we part of a plan to take Beelzebub down?"`
	"CN-728" `	"Beelzebub is perhaps the most wanted pirate warlord since the 28th century. With both Navy and Deep technology now in the hands of this criminal, every available ship will be required to take him down. Given this, we are now hoping that you would be willing to assist us in trapping Beelzebub. The six of your fleets combined would certainly make up for anything that the Navy has lost in the attack."`
	"CN-729" `	"How much will we be paid?" one of the other merchant captains asks. "At minimum, one million credits," the admiral replies. The captain who asked instantly agrees to help, as do two others.`
	"CN-730" `	"I'll help as well."`
	"CN-731" `	"Sorry, but I am not interested in helping."`
	"CN-732" `	One other merchant captain also declines, and you both are escorted out of the room, into the waiting elevator. The trip back to the surface is silent, and your escort dismisses you both with a simple "Goodbye."`
	"CN-733" `	In the end, only one of the merchant captains declines. She is escorted out of the room, and the admiral explains each merchant captain's new role.`
	"CN-734" `	"We assume that Beelzebub knows where we will be, but we know where he is as well - the stolen Cruisers and the pirate fleet that attacked our base moved toward the Core. Given the severity of the crime that Beelzebub has just committed, he will undoubtedly attempt to get as far away from the law as possible. That leaves us only two possible destinations: Buccaneer Bay, or the anarchist colonies of the Far North. Our best guess is that the colonies are the more appealing option to a warlord.`
	"CN-735" `	"We'll be setting up multiple blockades in hopes of boxing Beelzebub in as a number of fleets sweep the galaxy. Captain <last>, you will be stationed on <destination> with Lieutenant Paris and a small Navy fleet. Please gather your things and travel there immediately."`
	"CN-736" `Several of the <planet> spaceport landing pads are suitable for even the largest of Navy capital ships. Paris explains to you that at one time this world was used as a major Navy base, but has since been replaced by Farpoint closer to the Far North anarchist worlds.`
	"CN-737" `	Once every ship is parked, a captains' briefing is held on an empty landing pad. "Don't expect this job to be fun," Lieutenant Paris states. "We could be waiting around here for days before anything happens, and we need to stay in system the entire time."`
	"CN-738" `	"What do we do while we wait?"`
	"CN-739" `	"For now, you can walk around the spaceport and see what there might be to do, but don't stray too far, otherwise you might never get back to your ship in time." Paris hands you a communication device. "This way you can be notified when something happens regardless of where you are. I'm going to stay on my ship and monitor the incoming transmissions."`
	"CN-740" `	(Wander the spaceport.)`
	"CN-741" `	(Stay near my ship.)`
	"CN-742" `	Other than the occasional blaring of a train whistle, the spaceport of <planet> is rather tranquil. You pass the time by talking to a few tourists, most of whom are getting ready to go rock climbing. While walking through the restaurant district, the ground begins to shake slightly. Many of the locals don't even react to the earthquake, and eventually it subsides. Once you have walked through the entire spaceport and seen all that it has to offer, you begin to make your way back to your ship.`
	"CN-743" `	One of the Navy crewmen produces a football from their cabin, and a small game begins inside of an open landing pad. Others try to pass the time by reading or writing. Everyone comes to a standstill though once the ground begins to rumble; an earthquake. A Navy member calls out to everyone, "Don't worry, this is a small one. We get earthquakes like this a lot on Gemstone." The shaking eventually subsides, and you decide to go into your ship to rest.`
	"CN-744" `	Suddenly, your communication device beeps and you hear Lieutenant Paris' voice, "The blockade in Mirfak has just been attacked. I repeat, the blockade in Mirfak has just been attacked. Reports are that the blockade has sustained heavy losses as the pirate fleet included one of the stolen Cruisers."`
	"CN-745" `	A rather young recruit asks, "Should we go help them?" to which a senior officer responds, "We were given orders and we're going to follow them unless told otherwise." The comms fall silent, and the waiting resumes.`
	"CN-746" `	A few anxious hours pass with no new information. Suddenly, without warning, one of the Ravens takes off and your communications device begins blaring. "A pirate fleet just jumped into the system, alongside two Navy Cruisers painted in pirate colors!" All the captains and their crew scatter for their ships, ready to fight.`
	"CN-747" `Despite the commandeered Navy Cruisers, the pirates were unable to break through the blockade. After all of your group has landed, Paris invites the captains into his ship and makes contact with mission control. He relays the battle report, and you hear that the blockade in Matar was also attacked, but no stolen Cruisers were sighted.`
	"CN-748" `	"What are your orders, Admiral?" Paris asks over the comms.`
	"CN-749" `	"Lieutenant, your report makes three Cruisers accounted for, yet still no sign of Beelzebub. Our recon fleets have almost reached the blockades, meaning we'll catch this warlord soon enough. After the Navy fleet sweeping toward your post enters Nihal, I want you to lead everyone to <destination>. Beelzebub may be planning an attack on the blockade there with the remaining three Cruisers."`
	"CN-750" `	"Understood sir." After contacting the captain of the Navy fleet approaching <origin>, Paris holds a short all-hands briefing to inform the crew that they should be ready to leave for <destination> in a few hours.`
	"CN-751" `As you come in for a landing, you can see that a number of buildings have taken fire from the pirate fleet above. White tents have been set up to tend to the wounded and multiple ships are being repaired. You are directed to an unscathed building in which a number of Navy officers, the admiral you met on Luna, Lieutenant Paris, and your fellow merchant captains have convened. After you enter the room and get settled down, the admiral begins to speak.`
	"CN-752" `	"Here's the sitrep. Beelzebub's ship was spotted entering the system, followed by the rest of the pirate fleet. His ship seemed to disappear in the confusion, so we have no idea where he went. Either Beelzebub is currently hiding on the anarchist worlds or has made a dash for the Core, in which case the chase goes on."`
	"CN-753" `	"Beelzebub can't have gone to the Core," Paris butts in. "We traveled here through the uninhabited systems. We would have seen Beelzebub had he gone that way."`
	"CN-754" `	"That's good news then. All we have to do is wait Beelzebub out until he decides to poke his little head back out.`
	"CN-755" `	"Luckily, all six stolen Cruisers are accounted for, albeit destroyed. Deep Security forces have begun to collect the stolen sensor cubes. We can confirm that Beelzebub was watching our every move, since the cubes are being found all over the Paradise Worlds and Core. They should all be retrieved within the next week." The admiral then turns to the merchant captains. "Now that Beelzebub doesn't have the upper hand anymore, you are no longer needed. As promised, <payment> will be transferred to each of your accounts for your services."`
	"CN-756" `	"Thank you, Admiral," one of the captains replies.`
	"CN-757" `	"No, thank you. All of you. You didn't have to accept this risk but you did, and I speak for the whole Navy when I say that we are grateful for that."`
	"CN-758" `When you enter the <origin> spaceport, you hear what is undoubtedly a "There Might Be Riots" song playing loudly enough for everyone in the spaceport to hear. A quick glance around reveals the source of the noise to be the external speakers of a nearby Bounder and several people dancing.`
	"CN-759" `	(Dance with them.)`
	"CN-760" `	(Ignore them.)`
	"CN-761" `	You approach the Bounder and count five people dancing in total: three women and two men. One of the women dancing notices you walking over and exclaims, "Looks like someone else is about to join the party!" Her shout is met by a raucous cheer from the rest of the dancers, but you refuse to dance when they try to pull you into the fray.`
	"CN-762" `	After the music begins to subside, one of the dancers introduces himself to you as Garrison. Garrison then lists off the names of his fellow dancers: Pierre, Rayna, Hannah, and Laura. As you make your introductions, you learn that everyone here is part of the same research team, working for one of the Deep's many science bureaus, and they are currently wrapping up a short vacation by listening to their favorite band before they travel to Midgard on assignment.`
	"CN-763" `	You approach the Bounder and count five people dancing in total: three women and two men. One of the women dancing notices you walking over and exclaims, "Looks like someone else is about to join the party!" Her shout is met by a raucous cheer from the rest of the dancers, and they pull you into the fray.`
	"CN-764" `	After a few minutes of dancing, the music begins to subside. One of the dancers introduces himself to you as Garrison, and lists off the names of his fellow dancers: Pierre, Rayna, Hannah, and Laura. As you make your introductions, you learn that everyone here is part of the same research team, working for one of the Deep's many science bureaus, and they are currently wrapping up a short vacation by listening to their favorite band before they travel to Midgard on assignment.`
	"CN-765" `	"How do you know about 'There Might Be Riots?'" Hannah asks you.`
	"CN-766" `	"I've met them."`
	"CN-767" `	"I just like to listen to their music."`
	"CN-768" `	One of the other scientists, an older looking man named Pierre, looks right at you and stares. After a few moments he says, "I know you! You were in the 'Songs for the End of Civilization' broadcast from Pilot!" The rest of the scientists start agreeing with him as they look at you closer.`
	"CN-769" `	"You know 'There Might Be Riots?' You are so lucky!" says Rayna.`
	"CN-770" `	"I couldn't even see them during the 'Trouble on the Tarmac' tour, but you've met them? That's insane!" shrieks Laura.`
	"CN-771" `	Hannah chimes in, "Do you know where the band is? They've been quiet for a while now, ever since that broadcast. I heard rumors that the Republic detained them for trespassing, but since you're here..."`
	"CN-772" `	"I know where they are and rest assured, they're safe."`
	"CN-773" `	"Sorry, I don't know where they are."`
	"CN-774" `	The group falls silent until Rayna asks "Do you think you could bring them to us for a live concert?"`
	"CN-775" `	"I'd love to."`
	"CN-776" `	"No thanks. I have better things to do."`
	"CN-777" `	All five scientists burst out in a cheer, clearly excited for the chance to see their favorite band live. As the cheering dies down Laura says, "We must get going now, <first>. We're being stationed on Midgard for the next few months, so if you do find 'There Might Be Riots,' please bring them there." Each member of the group says goodbye to you as they depart.`
	"CN-778" `	The group looks visibly disappointed. A few minutes of talking later, they inform you that they must depart for Midgard and say their farewells.`
	"CN-779" `It takes you a while, but after a few hours of asking around the spaceport, you finally find someone who knows where the band is. "I saw them on <destination>," she says. "They were throwing a pretty gnarly concert just last week. I haven't heard of them playing anywhere else, so they might still be there."`
	"CN-780" `You find "There Might Be Riots" playing a gig right in the spaceport of <origin>. Judging by the large number of Hai in the audience, they seem to have amassed quite the following, even in Hai space.`
	"CN-781" `	While the band intermixes crowd favorites and some new songs clearly inspired by their time in Hai space, you make your way to the side of the makeshift stage. Once the concert ends, Ulrich notices you and approaches.`
	"CN-782" `	"Captain <last>, it's been a while! We've been having a great time with the peaceful squirrels ever since you dropped us off. It's the craziest experience we've ever had." He regales you with a number of adventures the band has been on since they came to Hai space, and how they were all surprised that even in such an idyllic place war was still a reality. "Say, what brings you here?"`
	"CN-783" `	He listens intently to your story of the scientists on <planet>, but his brow furrows when you mention the rumor of imprisonment by the Republic.`
	"CN-784" `	"Maybe we've been away long enough. I thought there would be some rumors or recordings that made it back to the Republic from here, but this place is a pretty well-kept secret, so perhaps not. Maybe it's time to go back to the land of the humans."`
	"CN-785" `	"Maybe we've been away long enough. With recent events, I suppose it's only a matter of time until our presence here becomes known more widely to the Republic anyway, so we don't exactly gain much by staying. Maybe it's time to go back to the land of the humans."`
	"CN-786" `	Ulrich gathers up the rest of the band and they pack up their supplies. You chart a course for <destination> as they load their musical equipment on your ship and get ready for the long ride back to human space.`
	"CN-787" `Almost as soon as "There Might Be Riots" steps off your ship, a crowd gathers. When it is clear that the band is not simply disembarking, but preparing to perform, the uproar makes you glad that you had not given any advance notification to the locals. As the band gets ready, you contact the spaceport authorities and have them notify Garrison and the other scientists that you have returned. The authorities don't seem too enthused about hosting a concert with no advance warning, but they agree to send your message.`
	"CN-788" `	The crowd gets larger and larger over time, and judging by the increased number of ships landing, word has quickly spread that "There Might Be Riots" is back.`
	"CN-789" `	As Ulrich and the band take the stage, you spot the scientists in the front row, grinning and cheering wildly. The first song is one you heard them play in Hai space, and even though none in the audience know the words to sing along, they appear to love the message, and the cheers and screams only grow more frenetic.`
	"CN-790" `	During an intermission, you invite the scientists onto your ship to personally meet the band. The thrill in the eyes of each of the scientists is astounding as they meet the members of "There Might Be Riots."`
	"CN-791" `	Before the intermission ends, each of the scientists thank you personally for bringing the band to Midgard, and Pierre even hands you <payment>. "It's the least we could give you," he adds. As the scientists start to depart your ship to listen to the rest of the concert, Hannah runs back to hug you before rejoining her friends in the crowd.`
	"CN-792" `When you land on <origin> and open your ship's main hatch, you find yourself face-to-face with two Deep Security officers, neither of whom appear armed. "Hello, Captain <last>. We're going to need to ask you some questions. If you would please step off of your ship and follow us, that would be much appreciated."`
	"CN-793" `	(Follow their orders.)`
	"CN-794" `	"Why do you need to question me?"`
	"CN-795" `	(Close the hatch and flee.)`
	"CN-796" `	"Because we wish to question you on the nature of your work for Albert Foster. Now please, step off your ship and come with us."`
	"CN-797" `	You follow the officers to a building located on the eastern edge of the spaceport. You are led to a small, dimly lit room on the second floor that contains nothing but two chairs and a table. You are told to sit in one of the chairs and wait.`
	"CN-798" `	You attempt to close the hatch, but a strong tingling sensation radiates from your abdomen. As you drop to the floor convulsing, you hold your eyes open long enough to glimpse a stun gun in one officer's hand.`
	"CN-799" `	You wake up, slumped in a chair, in a dimly lit room. Across the table is another chair, empty. As you twist about, examining the rest of the room, the lingering soreness in your abdomen reminds you that even though you are alone for the moment, attempting to leave is likely unwise.`
	"CN-800" `	(Wait.)`
	"CN-801" `	Ten minutes pass in silence until a figure enters the room. In the dim light, you discern a tall, dark woman wearing what looks like a Deep Security uniform. Some of its badges, pins, and striping are unfamiliar to you.`
	"CN-802" `	"I hope my men didn't have to struggle too much to get you here."`
	"CN-803" `	"Don't worry, it was just fine."`
	"CN-804" `	"It wasn't the warmest welcome I've ever received."`
	"CN-805" `	The woman chuckles slightly. "No need to be sarcastic with me. Now, you know why you're here."`
	"CN-806" `	"I do?"`
	"CN-807" `	"I didn't commit any crimes, so you have no right to detain me."`
	"CN-808" `	"Indeed, no crimes were committed during your work for Albert Foster, but we still have the right to detain you to keep the Deep safe. Cause us no trouble during this little meeting, answer my questions, and you will be on your way in a few minutes' time.`
	"CN-809" `	"Well if you don't then let me jog your memory: You took a small chip of wood from a historical church on Midgard - nothing criminal, mind you - and returned it to Vinci, where I assume you handed it over to the 'archaeologist' Albert Foster." The tone of her voice as she says "archaeologist," clearly conveys her disdain for his title. "Later you returned to Midgard with Albert Foster in tow, prompting us to run you out of the Deep.`
	"CN-810" `	"My first question to you: what exactly were you doing with Albert Foster?"`
	"CN-811" `	"We were scanning Midgard with gravitational field mapping equipment and spotted an artificial singularity before we fled."`
	"CN-812" `	"He told me he was researching the Deep and he needed help conducting his research."`
	"CN-813" `	"And why do you think he needed someone else to do the work for him?"`
	"CN-814" `	"Because he wanted something illegal done."`
	"CN-815" `	"Because he isn't allowed in the Deep."`
	"CN-816" `	"I already told you that you didn't commit a crime. The reason is that Foster has caused the Deep plenty of trouble in the past, so we don't particularly enjoy his presence. Now, did Albert make any discoveries due to your assistance?"`
	"CN-817" `	"Precisely. Now, did Albert make any discoveries due to your assistance?"`
	"CN-818" `	"He discovered that the church on Midgard is far older than should be possible, dating back to at least the early 1700s."`
	"CN-819" `	"We spotted something on Midgard that he called an 'artificial singularity.'"`
	"CN-820" `	"Interesting finding, Captain. Is there anything else that he discovered?"`
	"CN-821" `	"No."`
	"CN-822" `	"Yes. We used gravitational mapping equipment on Midgard and we found what looked like an artificial singularity."`
	"CN-823" `	The woman does not respond for a few seconds. When she does begin speaking, you have to lean in to hear her. "Don't lie to me. I can make this experience very uncomfortable for you."`
	"CN-824" `	"Alright. We discovered an artificial singularity on Midgard."`
	"CN-825" `	"See? That wasn't so hard to admit, now was it?"`
	"CN-826" `	The woman's mouth turns into a sly smile as she leans back in her chair. "Thank you for the information. That is all we needed you for. You will be escorted back outside momentarily. Enjoy the rest of your day, <first> <last>."`
	"CN-827" `	The woman's mouth turns into a sly smile as she leans back in her chair. "Thank you for the information, Captain. Before I let you go, I'd like to thank you for the work you've done for the Deep. I was interested to hear that the same Captain who helped us pursue Beelzebub also helped Albert Foster. Don't worry, we all make stupid mistakes. We'll scratch this one off your record.`
	"CN-828" `	"You clearly mean no harm to the Deep, so I'll give you the privilege of asking me any questions you might have after this encounter."`
	"CN-829" `You are escorted by two <planet> security guards to a Corvette occupying a landing pad close to the spaceport's Deep Security complex. Standing below the Corvette is the tall, dark-skinned woman who questioned you on your work for Albert Foster.`
	"CN-830" `	"Good evening, Captain," she looks up to the overcast sky for a moment, "or whatever time of day it might be right now. I've been informed that you proved yourself a great asset to the Navy and Deep Security in tracking down and... almost trapping Beelzebub. Please, come inside my ship for a moment."`
	"CN-831" `	(Follow her.)`
	"CN-832" `	"Why?"`
	"CN-833" `	"You can leave if you wish to, but I'd only be keeping you for a moment."`
	"CN-834" `	(Enter her ship.)`
	"CN-835" `	(Leave.)`
	"CN-836" `	The woman closes the Corvette's hatch, leaving you in the light of dim fluorescent bulbs. This must be quite an old ship to still be using fluorescent bulbs instead of the LED lights that most modern ships use for their interiors.`
	"CN-837" `	"I've asked you onto my ship so that we may have some privacy. You clearly mean no harm to the Deep. For starters, I'm sure you'll be happy to hear that we've scratched your incident with Albert Foster from your record. Additionally, I'm extending you the privilege of asking me any questions you might have relating to our last encounter."`
	"CN-838" `	"When was the Deep really settled?"`
	"CN-839" `	"Is there really an artificial singularity on Midgard?"`
	"CN-840" `	"I don't have any questions."`
	"CN-841" `	"The exact date has been lost to time, but folklore states that the first humans arrived here in the mid-1300s, before the time of the 'Black Death' plague on ancient Earth. It's not wise to believe in wonder tales, though."`
	"CN-842" `	"Were the original humans of the Deep really brought here by aliens?"`
	"CN-843" `	"I don't have any more questions."`
	"CN-844" `	"That's a question for the people who were originally brought here." The woman flashes another sly smile.`
	"CN-845" `	"Those gravitational mapping devices can be so finicky sometimes. I'm sure it was nothing."`
	"CN-846" `	"That will be enough questions for now. You will be escorted back outside momentarily. Enjoy the rest of your day, Captain."`
	"CN-847" `	"That will be enough questions for now."`
	"CN-848" `	"If that is all, then this meeting is over. You will be escorted back outside momentarily. Enjoy the rest of your day, Captain."`
	"CN-849" `	"Very well."`
	"CN-850" `	The woman gets up from her chair and stops in the doorway. She turns her head slightly and says in a low voice, "I'll be watching," then leaves. Moments later, the same two men that brought you here step into the room and ask you to follow them. They lead you to an entryway and lock the door as you step out into the spaceport.`
	"CN-851" `	The woman opens the hatch to the ship. "We might meet again in the future. Stay on your best behavior and our next meeting will surely be on good terms. Goodbye, Captain."`
	"CN-852" `While walking away from an argument with a local merchant over the price of a basket of fruit (ten credits is far too much for only a dozen pieces of fruit), you spy a group of four scientists moving about, briefly speaking with various captains.`
	"CN-853" `	One of them sees you, and after a brief moment examining the tablet in his hand, leads the group toward you.`
	"CN-854" `	"Hello, Captain," the tall man among the group says. "<first> <last>, is it?" You nod. "Splendid. I'm Garrison, and these are my colleagues Hannah, Pierre, and Laura. We're looking for a captain who would be able to give us a ride to a few planets in the Paradise sector where we will be acquiring supplies for our research. The Deep is currently short on spare transport ships, but did give us permission to hire trustworthy merchant captains so we don't miss our deadline. Would you be able to help?"`
	"CN-855" `	"I'd be glad to help. Where do you need to go?"`
	"CN-856" `	"Sorry, I'm too busy at the moment. You'll need to find a different captain."`
	"CN-857" `	You recognize them as Garrison, Hannah, Pierre, and Laura, the scientists who asked you to find There Might Be Riots. "<first> <last>, is that you? What a great time to run into you!" Garrison exclaims. "We're looking for a captain who can give us a ride to a few planets in the Paradise sector while we pick up supplies for our research. We'd normally use an official transport from the Deep, but they're having some trouble sparing one at the moment. Instead, we received permission to hire a trustworthy merchant captain to act as our transport. Would you be able to help?"`
	"CN-858" `	"Thank you, Captain. The planets that we need to go to are..." Garrison turns to the other three scientists. "<stopovers>," Hannah says.`
	"CN-859" `	"... Thanks. After we've gathered all the supplies, we'll need to be dropped off on <destination>."`
	"CN-860" `	You bring the scientists to your ship where they quickly make themselves comfy in the bunk rooms. As you walk to the bridge, you overhear Pierre quietly communicating with what you assume to be the spaceport authorities, "... <last> agreed. I expect Project Hawking to proceed on schedule. We will arrive before <day>." As you prepare for launch, you wonder what you've just signed up for.`
	"CN-861" `"Don't go to the spaceport," Garrison says. "We'll be dropping the supplies off elsewhere." He directs you toward the mountains.`
	"CN-862" `	As the peaks loom nearer, Garrison points to a set of four landing pads adjacent to a single building, the entire complex surrounded by trees. The nearest village is easily a few kilometers away.`
	"CN-863" `	As the peaks loom nearer, Garrison points to a set of four landing pads adjacent to a single building, the entire complex surrounded by trees. It is very close to the church whose wood you sampled for Albert Foster, meaning that it is also very close to where his gravitational sensors supposedly identified an "artificial singularity."`
	"CN-864" `	Several dozen forklifts are waiting for your ship on the surface, and your passengers busy themselves by supervising the unloading process. The high fencing around the landing pads prevents you from wandering, but you stretch your legs and enjoy the clear mountain air while you can.`
	"CN-865" `	Your stroll around the launchpads is interrupted by the familiar warning tones emitted by landing spacecraft, and you look up to see a Deep Security Raven, descending rapidly. It lands next to the <ship>, and Lieutenant Paris steps out, looking rather distressed.`
	"CN-866" `	"Captain! I'm going to need your ship's scanner logs from as far back as when you took this job."`
	"CN-867" `	Hearing the urgency in his voice, you hastily return to your ship's cockpit, copy the scanner logs onto a data chip, and bring it to Paris. He views the logs on a tablet.`
	"CN-868" `	"There appear to be three unidentified ships that began following you after each time you retrieved more cargo. Whether their intent is malicious or not, they are clearly interested in this project."`
	"CN-869" `	"What are you going to do?"`
	"CN-870" `	"Do you fear that we're in danger?"`
	"CN-871" `	"I have no idea." Paris looks over to the crew that are unloading the cargo. "Hurry up, men!" One of them shouts back, "Only a few more crates left, Sir."`
	"CN-872" `	Paris turns to you and says "I suggest you leave immediately," and then turns to the scientists, "and you four should come with me while we figure out what is happening here. Here may not be safe for you."`
	"CN-873" `	In space, the noise from high-powered atomic engines can only be heard as a dull rumbling, and even then, only aboard the ship they propel. In atmosphere, however, they are deafening. The thunderclap of a high-speed atmospheric re-entry forces everyone to look up. A battle-scarred Quicksilver in pirate colors is racing toward the building. The workers scramble for cover, abandoning their machinery and the cargo.`
	"CN-874" `	(Run for my ship.)`
	"CN-875" `	(Run for the nearest cover.)`
	"CN-876" `	You sprint toward your ship as fast as you can, but before you can reach it you hear the Quicksilver's cannons roar to life. The projectiles stream right overhead, exploding into the side of the building, sending rubble everywhere and knocking you off your feet.`
	"CN-877" `	You duck for cover behind a concrete barrier that divides two landing pads when you hear the Quicksilver's cannons roar to life. The projectiles stream right overhead, exploding into the side of the building, sending rubble everywhere.`
	"CN-878" `	As quickly as it appeared, the Quicksilver disappears, shrouded from view by the trees. Even though its engine noise has abated, Paris has to shout for his orders to be heard above the commotion. As you rise to your feet you feel the earth heave, and a few moments later the muffled thud of an explosion drowns out Paris' voice. A dark cloud of smoke is rising up from a half kilometer away, in the direction the Quicksilver flew. Even in daylight you can see light from the fires below, reflected ominously by the airborne soot. A second tremor, somehow larger than the first, catches everyone off guard, knocking you back to the ground.`
	"CN-879" `	"Earthquake!"`
	"CN-880" `	"What is happening?"`
	"CN-881" `	No one is able to hear you over the low rumble of the shaking ground and the rustling of the forest around the complex. The building, already scarred and torn open by weapons fire, crumbles under the new stresses leaving only a pile of rubble. A minute after the tremor began, the vibrations stop, leaving the air silent; not even the rustle of the leaves or the tweet of a bird can be heard.`
	"CN-882" `	Everyone is clearly startled by the experience as they slowly raise themselves from the ground. You spot Garrison helping up Pierre and Hannah. Lieutenant Paris and Laura are in a tight embrace, but quickly release each other when they notice you looking.`
	"CN-883" `	A few Deep Security ships begin to land, dropping off medics and cleanup crews to take care of the destroyed building. One of the ships flies in the direction of the fire. Paris says to you, "Captain, I think you should leave. Deep Security will handle the situation here."`
	"CN-884" `	You say goodbye to the scientists, who thank you for helping them, even if much of the cargo was destroyed. You board your ship and fly toward the spaceport. Upon landing, you find that <payment> have been transferred to your account from Deep Security.`
	"CN-885" `The majority of Carbuncle Station is restricted to normal visitors. The workers here will not even refuel your ship upon request. It's clear that Lovelace Labs, the owners of this station, have secrets stored within the walls of this station.`
	"CN-886" `	You open your docking doors, only to find the bulkhead doors to the rest of the station blocked by three well-armed security officers. You follow the scientists' lead and approach the guards. They spend several minutes conversing, but eventually a guard activates a toggle on his communicator. A video screen next to the bulkhead blinks on, revealing a woman in a uniform distinctly more embellished than those of the guards before you.`
	"CN-887" `	"What brings you here to Carbuncle Station?"`
	"CN-888" `	Pierre responds with only two words, "Project Hawking," and the screen momentarily goes blank. When it flickers on again, she is equally succinct and says only, "Admit three."`
	"CN-889" `	After a short discussion, Garrison agrees to stay behind with you. Pierre, Hannah, and Laura are led through an awkwardly small opening in the bulkhead door, into the restricted area. Rather than wait in front of the guards, you return to the comfort of your ship with Garrison.`
	"CN-890" `	"How should we pass the time while we wait?"`
	"CN-891" `	"How long will it be before they come back?"`
	"CN-892" `	"It shouldn't take long for them to come back, so we could have a short chat if you want."`
	"CN-893" `	"At most ten minutes. In the meantime, we could have a short chat. I find dead air annoyingly awkward."`
	"CN-894" `	"Do you know what Lovelace Labs keeps in this station?"`
	"CN-895" `	"What is 'Project Hawking'?"`
	"CN-896" `	"I haven't the faintest idea what they keep here. Even if I did, I'm sure I wouldn't be allowed to tell you. The only thing I know for sure they have here are components for the project we're working on."`
	"CN-897" `	"Project Hawking?" you ask. Garrison nods.`
	"CN-898" `	"The exact details of Project Hawking are classified. I'm not able to tell you much aside from the fact that we're doing energy and weapons research. Scientists from the Deep who are highly specialized in a certain field will be asked to work on government projects every so often.`
	"CN-899" `	"In the field of energy engineering, I'm among the best that the Deep has to offer. I worked on the Dwarf Core." Garrison pauses and chuckles to himself before saying, "I also contributed toward the creation of those comically impractical LP576a Battery Packs that I have yet to see a single ship using.`
	"CN-900" `	"Anyhow, because of my past work, the Deep approached me to work on this project. The pay was better than what I was getting before so I accepted it. It was a pleasant surprise to meet my partners as well. Hannah graduated in the same undergrad class as me, double majoring in quantum mechanics and ancient history, of all things."`
	"CN-901" `	"What is it that you need from Carbuncle Station that is so secret?"`
	"CN-902" `	"What about Pierre and Laura?"`
	"CN-903" `	"Like I said already, the project is classified. It's not something I would understand, though. It's in Laura's field of expertise. You see, she has a PHD in--"`
	"CN-904" `	"Pierre is an older guy, he's been working on laser weaponry for the better part of three decades now. Before this he was working on a separate project, but the Deep asked that he take time away from that to work on Project Hawking while they try to find a replacement for him, since the project needed someone with better knowledge in laser weaponry than the rest of us.`
	"CN-905" `	"Pierre is an older guy. He has been working on laser weaponry for the better part of three decades now. If you've ever seen an Electron Beam in action, you have him to thank for that. And a few others, of course, but one of his findings is really what brought the whole project together.`
	"CN-906" `	"Laura, on the other hand--"`
	"CN-907" `	Before Garrison can finish speaking, the other three scientists return, helping each other carry a sealed metal box. "We're just going to set this in the back, if you don't mind," Pierre says. The scientists make themselves cozy in the bunk rooms and get ready to depart.`
	"CN-908" `	A chirping from your ship's radio indicates you have received a message from the station. You open it and are not shocked at its contents:`
	"CN-909" `		Your immediate departure is required.`
	"CN-910" `					Carbuncle Station Docking Authority`
	"CN-911" `	You signal to your crew and passengers that takeoff is imminent, and obey the wishes of Lovelace Labs' research station.`
	"CN-912" `As you approach the massive <planet> spaceport building, Pierre directs you to park on a landing pad on the third story, close to the warehouse section. "We're picking up various materials used in the creation of ships, that we need samples of for testing," Pierre explains.`
	"CN-913" `	The scientists speak with the spaceport authorities, who begin loading several tons of alloys into your cargo from an overhead platform. You sit with Pierre as you wait for them to finish.`
	"CN-914" `	"That's a lot of different alloys. What are they going to be used for?"`
	"CN-915" `	"Why did we need to come all the way to Prime to get these materials?"`
	"CN-916" `	Pierre cocks his head to the side as he looks at you. "We're going to destroy them. Short and simple. We need to see how different ship alloys hold up to the technology we're working on.`
	"CN-917" `	"We could have gotten materials from a shipyard local to the Deep, but Betelgeuse Shipyards gets regular shipments of metals more commonly used by shipyards in the Dirt Belt, so it's really the closest place to get everything we need."`
	"CN-918" `	"Do you enjoy the work you do for the Deep?"`
	"CN-919" `	"How long have you been working for the Deep?"`
	"CN-920" `	"Let me answer that question with a short story of my life." Pierre clears his throat and puffs up his chest a little, as if preparing himself to tell a great epic. He may enjoy talking about himself a little too much...`
	"CN-921" `	"I was born on Windblain in the Regor system. It's a small, quiet world of little galactic importance, but you should give it a visit sometime. My family wasn't the most well off, so I needed to work hard in my studies, which paid off immensely. Thanks to my exceptional grades in university, I was offered a government job even before graduation. I've been working directly for the Deep for the past 35 years and counting, and I've loved every minute of it! My younger sister though... well, let's just say she wasn't so focused on being successful in school and ended up on the wrong side of the law.`
	"CN-922" `	"How about you?"`
	"CN-923" `	You tell Pierre about your life on <starting planet>, and how you saved up your money working at the textile mill from the age of fifteen until you were able to buy a pilot's license and finally leave your home world for the stars.`
	"CN-924" `	Making sure to not bring up <starting planet> or the Hai by name, you tell Pierre about your life, and how you did your best at a travel agency to get to the stars as soon as you could.`
	"CN-925" `	"We aren't too different then," Pierre remarks. "We both worked hard to get where we are today. Thanks for sharing, <first>."`
	"CN-926" `	"The cargo is all in, Captain!" Garrison yells down from the platform above. "We're ready when you are!"`
	"CN-927" `"It might take a while to get a hold of the electronics we need," Pierre says after you land. "Just stick around the spaceport while we're gone."`
	"CN-928" `	"You guys can handle it, right?" Hannah asks. "I haven't been to Vinci in years. I want to see the virtual reality activities they have in the spaceport arcade now."`
	"CN-929" `	The other three scientists agree that they can make do without her, and she immediately runs off in the direction of the spaceport arcade. When you find her, she is busy playing a VR table tennis game against an AI hologram. By the look of things she is an amazing player, and the score is currently tied.`
	"CN-930" `	"You're doing great! Do you play table tennis often?"`
	"CN-931" `	"You can do it!"`
	"CN-932" `	Hannah slams the virtual ball with her paddle, causing it to bounce off the table, fly right past her opponent, and disintegrate into thin air.`
	"CN-933" `	"I did pretty good, didn't I? It's my first time playing table tennis, too."`
	"CN-934" `	"How did you do that good for your first time?"`
	"CN-935" `	"I'm just a quick learner. Always have been. In university I would do work for my history courses while sitting through lectures on quantum mechanics. Got straight A's in both classes without a problem."`
	"CN-936" `	"That's a strange combination of classes."`
	"CN-937" `	"What did you learn in ancient history?"`
	"CN-938" `	"That's what everyone else told me, too. It was fun though, and a lot of what I learned in ancient history was just as interesting as what I learned in quantum mechanics."`
	"CN-939" `	"What did you learn in ancient history?" you ask.`
	"CN-940" `	"I could spend weeks on end talking about what I learned in those classes. The most interesting thing I learned has to be my ancestry. Most of my ancestors came from a place on Earth called Scandinavia, and my last name means 'garden' in an ancient language.`
	"CN-941" `	"It's interesting to know where my ancestors lived over a thousand years ago when humanity was still stuck on Earth. It's amazing that the hyperdrive was invented when it was too, because we could have easily wiped ourselves out if we hadn't. Life still isn't perfect across the galaxy, but it's still far better on average than it was on Earth alone."`
	"CN-942" `	Hannah looks like she is ready to endlessly blather on about Earth before the hyperdrive was invented, but you are saved by Laura. "We got the electronics we need loaded onto your ship, Captain. Garrison and Pierre are waiting for us there."`
	"CN-943" `While wandering through the spaceport, you are approached by a man you instantly recognize as Ivan, the scientist whose drone you recovered data from in Terminus, thanks to his comically thick glasses. He mentions that he heard how helpful you have been to others within the Deep.`
	"CN-944" `	"I was hoping you would continue assisting us in our research on the spatial anomaly in Terminus. Thanks to the data you retrieved, we have deduced that the anomaly is in fact some sort of wormhole, but it is far too unstable to support sending anything through it."`
	"CN-945" `	Ivan looks around then leans in to whisper to you. "I must ask you, do you know of the Hai?" You nod. "Splendid!" He jumps up, nearly knocking his own glasses off his face. "Then you will be able to help. One of the scientists on my team grew up in their territory, and suggested that the so-called 'quantum keystones' which they sell might have something to do with the wormhole. He recalls hearing some Hai folktales of these stones making travel between the stars easier, and since the Hai once lived close to where the wormhole is, there may be a relation. Given that it would be immensely difficult to stabilize the wormhole with our current knowledge, it may be that these stones will make access into the wormhole easier. Would you kindly retrieve ten of them for us, so that we may be able to discover if these legends are true?"`
	"CN-946" `	"I would be glad to help."`
	"CN-947" `	"Sorry, but Hai space is too far for me."`
	"CN-948" `	"Thank you again, Captain!" he says very enthusiastically. "I'd have traveled myself, but I must confess we are low on funds and will not receive more unless we make some sort of discovery. We will be able to pay for half the cost of the stones once you return."`
	"CN-949" `	"I already know what is on the other side of the wormhole. In fact, installing a single quantum keystone is enough to enter into the spatial anomaly."`
	"CN-950" `	"Sorry, but Hai space is too far for me right now."`
	"CN-951" `	Ivan looks like he is about to fall over with joy after you mention having entered the wormhole. "Really? Please, tell me what you found!"`
	"CN-952" `	You tell Ivan all that you saw on the other side of the wormhole, and how you found strange-looking humans who communicate in song and sign language that attacked you after you wouldn't submit to a blood test. You also mention the other oddities of the region of space, including the strange alien creatures in Nenia that are able to survive in the vacuum of space, as well as the large number of wormholes that allow traversal throughout the region.`
	"CN-953" `	(Reveal the existence of the Remnant.)`
	"CN-954" `	(Don't reveal the existence of the Remnant.)`
	"CN-955" `	You tell Ivan about how the region of space beyond the wormhole is known as the "Ember Waste" and that it is inhabited by a group of friendly humans who fled there during the Alpha Wars. These humans have advanced independently from the rest of humanity for centuries. You mention their strange culture, sharing what you can remember about the songs the Remnant people sang.`
	"CN-956" `	You also mention the other oddities of the Ember Waste, including the strange alien creatures in Nenia that are able to survive in the vacuum of space, as well as the large number of wormholes that allow traversal throughout the region.`
	"CN-957" `	You tell Ivan about the region of space beyond the wormhole and its vast loneliness. You describe the ever-present red glow, similar to the color of the wormhole. You also mention the strange alien creatures in Nenia that are able to survive in the vacuum of space, as well as the large number of wormholes that allow traversal throughout the region.`
	"CN-958" `	"This is very interesting, and would turn out to be an amazing discovery if true. Please, bring us the quantum keystones so that we might try to understand the properties which allow entry into the wormhole's threshold. Later we will learn more about this region that you describe. Oh, before I forget: we can pay you for half of the cost of the keystones."`
	"CN-959" `	"Sorry, I don't want to help with this."`
	"CN-960" `Upon returning to <planet>, you learn that Ivan has left for his research lab on Valhalla, but his research assistant, Rayna, is waiting to retrieve the keystones. She hands you <payment>, enough to pay for half of the cost of the stones.`
	"CN-961" `Upon returning to <planet>, you learn that Ivan has left for his research lab on Valhalla, but instead you find that Rayna is waiting to retrieve the keystones. She hands you <payment>, enough to pay for half of the cost of the stones.`
	"CN-962" `	"Thank you for buying these keystones for us. It may take us a month or two to fully study them. We'll contact you when we're in need of your assistance again."`
	"CN-963" `You receive a message from Ivan, the scientist working on the spatial anomaly in Terminus. "Captain, we have finished studying the quantum keystones, and they do in fact allow access through the wormhole. Please meet with me on <destination> if you wish to continue helping us with our research."`
	"CN-964" `This system is full of strange, space-dwelling creatures that appear to be eating asteroids. The sight of their mouthparts chewing rock into dust is sure to be a recurring nightmare for any captain who visits this system. You make a note to avoid flying too close, in case they mistake your ship for their next meal.`
	"CN-965" `	With these strange creatures so close to the wormhole, one can only wonder what lies deeper in this region of space.`
	"CN-966" `You contact Ivan after you land and he sends you directions to his research lab, located on the outskirts of the city. "Quite the distance from my office, but we work with what we have," he comments. When you arrive, you hardly have time to greet Ivan, Rayna, and the others before Ivan begins discussing what they have learned from the quantum keystones.`
	"CN-967" `	"As you mentioned before, a single keystone is sufficient to enter the wormhole," Ivan says. "We've determined that there is a stabilization effect, either on the ship or the wormhole, that allows matter to cross the threshold. However, we'll need much more time and data to fully understand the true mechanism.`
	"CN-968" `	"Last time, you mentioned that there were alien creatures able to survive the vacuum of space, correct?"`
	"CN-969" `	You nod.`
	"CN-970" `	"Right. Well, it would be extremely interesting if we were to learn more about these alien creatures.`
	"CN-971" `	"Last time, you mentioned that there were humans living in this space, the... the 'Remainder?'"`
	"CN-972" `	"Remnant," you say.`
	"CN-973" `	"Right, that was it. Well, it would be extremely interesting if we were to learn more about this people.`
	"CN-974" `	"We've analyzed the keystones, and surprisingly they do allow entry into the wormhole in Terminus," Ivan explains. "It would appear that the stones stabilize the wormhole as the ship passes through it, or maybe it is stabilizing the ship in some way and not the wormhole. We'll need much more time to fully understand the true mechanism that is at play here. Whatever the case is, one stone is required for each ship to pass through the wormhole.`
	"CN-975" `	"We sent a single drone through the wormhole to test that it was passable, and programmed it to return immediately in case the region beyond is hostile or dangerous. Would you be willing to explore the region for us? You may want to install a ramscoop, as we are unsure if there will be anywhere for your ship to refuel."`
	"CN-976" `	"Actually, I already explored the region beyond the wormhole while you were researching."`
	"CN-977" `	"Sorry, I don't want to work for you anymore."`
	"CN-978" `When you return, Ivan and the rest of the scientists wait eagerly for you to explain what you discovered.`
	"CN-979" `	You begin by recounting your experience with the strange space-dwelling creatures you found in the Nenia system. Ivan's eyes go wide when you mention the ease with which they fed on asteroids, and how they seemed to effortlessly escape from the gravity of local gas giants. You also mention that there are more strange wormholes like the one that you passed through to enter the region of space, including a series of wormholes that create a loop between multiple systems.`
	"CN-980" `	You then tell them about the strange-looking humans who communicate in song and sign language that attacked you after you wouldn't submit to a blood test.`
	"CN-981" `	You then tell them about the Remnant, a group of friendly humans who fled human space during the Alpha Wars and have advanced independently of humanity for centuries, and how they call the region of space the "Ember Waste."`
	"CN-982" `	The group of scientists looks captivated the entire time, almost like kindergarten children listening to a fairy tale. When you finish talking, they immediately chatter among themselves, seeming to be most interested in the alien creatures which inhabit the region. They seem to agree that they need to learn more about these aliens.`
	"CN-983" `	"We can seek to learn more about these alien creatures later," Ivan says.`
	"CN-984" `	The group of scientists looks captivated the entire time, almost like kindergarten children listening to a fairy tale. When you finish talking, they immediately chatter among themselves, seeming to be most interested in the human beings which inhabit the region. They seem to agree that they need to learn more about these humans, and more specifically about the technology which they have developed.`
	"CN-985" `	"We can seek to learn more about this group of humans later," Ivan says.`
	"CN-986" `	"But, first and foremost, we should continue our work on understanding these wormholes. You mentioned a strange series of wormholes. Their behavior is definitely noteworthy. Could you return to this region of space while carrying a suite of astronomic instruments? If you travel through these wormholes, we may learn more about what makes them tick."`
	"CN-987" `	"Okay, I'm willing to do it."`
	"CN-988" `	"Sorry, but I didn't agree to help you beyond that first job. Goodbye."`
	"CN-989" `	"Wonderful! We'll get the instruments loaded onto your ship immediately."`
	"CN-990" `	"I'm always willing to go on an adventure."`
	"CN-991" `	"This sounds too risky. You're going to need to find someone else to go exploring."`
	"CN-992" `	"Splendid! We will give you a single quantum keystone in order to travel through the wormhole. Return here once you have finished exploring."`
	"CN-993" `The team of scientists is already waiting in the spaceport when you arrive. They remove the equipment from your ship and immediately begin analyzing the results after returning to the lab.`
	"CN-994" `	"At first glance, this series of wormholes seems no different than the one that is used to enter this region of space, but it will require some time for us to go over all the data the sensors collected," Ivan explains to you.`
	"CN-995" `	"While you wait, though, I have another job you could do. You mentioned something about strange alien creatures beyond the wormhole that seemed to be able to survive in the vacuum of space. Would you be able to return there and scan them for us? These alien creatures won't have 'outfits' for the scanners to pick up, but a typical outfits scanner is still likely to give us the most information."`
	"CN-996" `	"While you wait, though, I have another job you could do. You mentioned something about a group of humans, or at least human-like beings, beyond the wormhole. Would you be able to return there and scan their ships for us? I'd be interested in seeing what an outfits scanner returns. You need not contact them, simply find a couple of ships and scan them so that we might learn more about their capabilities."`
	"CN-997" `	"Sounds like a good plan. I'll be back as soon as I can."`
	"CN-998" `	"Sorry, but I'm not comfortable with this idea. You'll need to find someone else."`
	"CN-999" `You receive a message from Ivan after you land. "Thanks for all your help recently. We brought our findings to the Deep government, but given their sensitive nature the Deep is taking its time deciding whether to fund further research. In the meantime, I've transferred <payment> of my own funds to your account. I have no doubt the Deep will approve further funding for our project in the future, so I've simply written this off as a business expense. I'll contact you once we continue our research beyond the wormhole. Thanks again!"`
	"CN-1000" `You receive a message from Ivan, the Deep scientist who you helped to discover the Remnant in the Ember Waste. "Captain <last>, it's been so long. The Deep has finally finished reviewing our research in the Ember Waste, and we've been approved for further funding! Please meet us on <destination> if you wish to assist us again. Your help would be appreciated, but we will make progress even if you're unable to help."`
	"CN-1001" `	(Accept.)`
	"CN-1002" `	(Decline.)`
	"CN-1003" `Thanks to the new funding grants from the Deep, the team has moved their research lab into a more advanced facility closer to the spaceport. "This new location will make transferring cargo from your ship to the lab much easier, something we expect to do a lot of in the next few months. It's also much closer to my office, which will make life much easier," Ivan adds. "A careful study of the outfit scans you collected has indicated that the Remnant technology uses unprecedented advancements and improvements that haven't been seen in any human technology before.`
	"CN-1004" `	"Even though the Remnant have attacked you, we are very interested in what additional secrets their technology may hold. Are you willing to steal some of their technology and bring it to us for analysis?"`
	"CN-1005" `	"Is this really necessary?"`
	"CN-1006" `	"I'd be more than happy to help."`
	"CN-1007" `	"Sorry, but I'm not interested in working for you anymore."`
	"CN-1008" `	"If they aren't willing to be friendly and simply sell you their technology then I'm afraid that this is the only way that we can obtain it. You don't have to destroy their ships if you don't want to, we simply need you to disable a few and take some of their outfits."`
	"CN-1009" `	"Alright, I'll do it."`
	"CN-1010" `	"Sorry, but I'm not going to attack human beings for the sake of science."`
	"CN-1011" `	"You told us that these humans were friendly... well, until you scanned their ships, that is. Do they allow you to purchase their technology?"`
	"CN-1012" `	"No," you respond. "They haven't given me a license to buy any of their outfits or ships."`
	"CN-1013" `	The scientists ponder this for a moment. Eventually, Rayna speaks up. "Maybe if you assist them in some way they may welcome you into their society. I can imagine that they are a little wary after all those years on their own. Try doing jobs for them or see if anyone in their spaceports needs something from you."`
	"CN-1014" `	"You could also plunder their technology if they won't sell it to you," Ivan chimes in. "Without killing them, of course," he adds.`
	"CN-1015" `	"I'll see if I can try to get my hands on what you need."`
	"CN-1016" `	"Sorry, but I'm not interested in doing that kind of work for you."`
	"CN-1017" `	"Yes," you respond. "I had to do a few odd jobs for them, but they eventually allowed me to purchase their outfits and ships."`
	"CN-1018" `	"Then all you need to do is buy whatever we ask you to and bring it back here. Are you interested?"`
	"CN-1019" `	"I'd be glad to help."`
	"CN-1020" `	"Sorry, but I don't want to spend money for your research."`
	"CN-1021" `	"Great!" Ivan exclaims. "Right now we'd be interested in studying their engines. Please bring us one Forge-Class Thruster and one Forge-Class Steering. They shouldn't be too hard to get."`
	"CN-1022" `An unloading crew quickly removes the engines from your ship and transports them to Ivan's research lab. You are escorted into a lobby where one of the administrative staff pays you <payment> in exchange for the engines. He asks you to wait, indicating that Ivan or one of the other scientists should be out to meet you shortly. After about three hours of waiting, Ivan enters the room.`
	"CN-1023" `	"These engines, they are fantastic! The scans made them seem similar to human ion engines, but surprisingly they can outperform even atomic engines! The thrust-to-mass ratio is great, and they have somehow avoided the immense heat generation that our engines emit. They do have some downsides, but it's still amazing that such an isolated group of humans could make technological leaps beyond even what the Deep has accomplished.`
	"CN-1024" `	"We've decided that the next Remnant technology we'd like to examine is their power generation. Could you bring us one of their Millennium Cells?"`
	"CN-1025" `	"Sure. I'll be back in no time at all."`
	"CN-1026" `	"Sorry, but I'm no longer interested in working for you."`
	"CN-1027" `Again, the Remnant technology is removed from your ship and transported to the research lab. You wander into the waiting area and are paid <payment>. After several hours, the scientists come to you with their initial findings.`
	"CN-1028" `	"This Millennium Cell is little more than a radiothermal generator. Not exactly the best kind of generator if you're looking for lots of power - our Fusion Reactors are far better at that - but for a radiothermal generator, it produces remarkably little heat. We'll have to take it apart to find out how they are manipulating the decay heat so effectively, but preparing for that will take some time.`
	"CN-1029" `	"I suppose by now you've seen the Remnant ships in combat more than a few times. The outfit scans showed one of their primary weapons is a modified Particle Cannon, but we'd need to see the actual weapon in order to understand how the modification works. Would you retrieve an Inhibitor Cannon for us?"`
	"CN-1030" `	"I'd be glad to."`
	"CN-1031" `Instead of sending the Inhibitor Cannon to Ivan's lab, the unloading crew transfers it to a waiting Deep Security ship, which immediately departs when its cargo bay doors close. Unlike the previous crews that met you upon landing, they are all in military garb. When you meet Ivan at his lab, he explains that the Deep was especially interested in the Remnant technology after reading his previous reports, and that his team would need to study it in a "more secure location."`
	"CN-1032" `	Ivan hands you <payment>. "Thank you for all the help, Captain <last>. You've done a lot for humanity in these past few months. It may take us years to fully understand the technology you have brought us, but rest assured that once we do understand it, the galaxy will be a better place. I'll see you later, Captain. Stay safe."`
	"CN-1033" `	Ivan hands you <payment>. "Thank you for all the help, Captain <last>, but I have one last thing to ask." Ivan reaches into his pocket and retrieves six objects that you recognize as sensor cubes. "Would you bring two of these to each of the Remnant worlds? We've been learning a great deal from the study of the Remnant outfits, but aside from your scanning logs we have very little information on the Remnant ships. If you were to place these near their spaceports, they would be able to scan any nearby ships, which would be most helpful."`
	"CN-1034" `	"You can count on me, Ivan."`
	"CN-1035" `	"Sorry, but this doesn't seem like the right thing to do. You'll need to find someone else to do this for you."`
	"CN-1036" `	"Thank you, Captain. Return here once you have finished, and I'll ensure you are well compensated for the journey."`
	"CN-1037" `When you return to <planet>, you are unable to find Ivan. Instead, Rayna waves you down and hands you a credits chip worth <payment>.`
	"CN-1038" `	"Ivan told me to give this to you, Captain. Thanks again for helping us out so much. We couldn't have done it without you."`
	"CN-1039" `You try to make an effort to not be seen as you decide where to place the cubes. You place one outside of the spaceport dome, burying it in the snow so it is difficult to find. The other you tuck into a dark corner of the spaceport, and as soon as you let it go it blends in surprisingly well with its surroundings.`
	"CN-1040" `You place the first of the cubes at the entrance of a now-abandoned underground settlement, in a dark area where it will not be seen. Unable to find a good spot for the second, you decide to leave it in a ditch and cover it in sand. Although you are unable to see anyone, you feel that you are being watched. As the only non-Remnant you are not exactly inconspicuous, but no one approaches you as you return to your ship.`
	"CN-1041" `As you walk through the oldest part of the town, you spot an alleyway that has plenty of nooks in which a cube can be concealed. You decide to place the other one far outside of town, near the top of the valley where the spaceport can still be seen.`
	"CN-1042" `While watching a local sports game on the telescreen of a spaceport restaurant called "The <origin> Sif," your name is called from the entrance. You turn your head and spot Lieutenant Paris waving at you to come outside. You pay for your meal and walk outside.`
	"CN-1043" `	"Hello Captain. Do you have a moment to talk?"`
	"CN-1044" `	"I do. What do you need?"`
	"CN-1045" `	"This isn't a situation that can wait, Captain. You are needed immediately."`
	"CN-1046" `	"What is it?"`
	"CN-1047" `	"I can't help you. You're going to need to find someone else."`
	"CN-1048" `	"A number of scientists have been kidnapped during a venture to the Far North. Their intent was to research the Wolf-Rayet star in the Gorvi system. Due to this system's proximity to the anarchist worlds, very little research has been conducted on it. Pierre, Hannah, and... and Laura were all aboard the Star Queen which contained the scientists. Since you know them I only thought it fair that you should know about the situation.`
	"CN-1049" `	"It was yesterday that we were informed of the kidnapping. The Star Queen and its escorts were preparing to refuel on Prime in the Betelgeuse system when a large pirate fleet entered the system. The Star Queen's escorts were swiftly destroyed, and she was captured. We lost all communications with the vessel after that. Would you be willing to help us locate the Star Queen while we prepare a rescue force?"`
	"CN-1050" `	"I would be glad to help. I'll prepare my ship immediately."`
	"CN-1051" `	"Why can't you locate it yourself?"`
	"CN-1052" `	"Given the importance of the scientists aboard the Star Queen, we took great care in providing them with some of the strongest warships we had. The loss of these ships and their crew is a major blow to Deep Security's combat capabilities. We are recoiling from the impact of this loss while we assemble a proper rescue fleet and are unable to spare any ships for a scout fleet at this moment.`
	"CN-1053" `	"In a situation like this, every minute matters, and if someone like you can find the Star Queen quickly then that means that there is a higher chance everyone can come out of this alive."`
	"CN-1054" `	"Okay, I'm willing to help."`
	"CN-1055" `	"Sorry, but this doesn't sound worth it to me."`
	"CN-1056" `The Star Queen is not in this system, so you attempt to find somebody who may have some information. After visiting several shops, you find a merchant who was clearing cargo through customs as the Star Queen departed. According to her, a large pirate fleet jumped in, eviscerated the escorts with weapons she had never seen before, and escaped north towards Rigel with the hostage Star Queen. You can only hope the trail is not already cold.`
	"CN-1057" `After speaking with a Navy officer for a few minutes, you find out that the Star Queen came through here over a week ago, escorted by several large pirate ships. The Navy did not want to risk the lives of those on the ship by engaging the pirate fleet, so they let it continue north.`
	"CN-1058" `	You spot preparations for a rescue mission, but upon inquiring, learn that the recent destruction of a number of Navy capital ships in the days preceding the Star Queen's abduction resulted in an order to wait for additional reinforcements before any Navy ships are allowed to leave station.`
	"CN-1059" `	The Navy officer ends by hinting that the Star Queen is likely to be in Alnilam or Arneb, as those systems are the farthest from anyone looking to find or rescue the ship.`
	"CN-1060" `You spend a few hours scanning the surface of the planet in an attempt to find the Star Queen, but nothing comes up. It will likely require military-grade scanners in order to find the ship, which the Deep Security rescue fleet will undoubtedly have.`
	"CN-1061" `You return to Valhalla and find Lieutenant Paris with a large group of men and women in Deep Security uniforms. As you approach them, the Lieutenant stops speaking to the group after noticing you. "Captain <last>! Have you located the Star Queen?"`
	"CN-1062" `	"Yes, it is located on <destination>, but is heavily defended."`
	"CN-1063" `	You mention the multiple heavy warships that you saw in the system, and the fact that there are likely many more waiting on Haven.`
	"CN-1064" `	You mention the multiple heavy warships that you saw in the system, and the fact that there are likely many more waiting on Haven. You also relay the merchant's claim that the pirates were using weapons she had never seen before.`
	"CN-1065" `	After hearing this news, many of the faces in the group turn grim as they realize that they will need to fight to retrieve the Star Queen. Paris ponders this information for a moment, then turns back to the group. "Guards, ready your ships!" The group responds with a collective "Sir, yes sir!" before running off to their ships.`
	"CN-1066" `	Before leaving for his own ship, he walks up to you and hands you <payment>.`
	"CN-1067" `	"Thank you for locating the Star Queen. Now, Captain <last>, would you be willing to help us? If the Star Queen is as heavily defended as you say it is, we are going to need every ship we can get."`
	"CN-1068" `	"I would rather let the professionals handle things. Good luck."`
	"CN-1069" `	"Thank you so much. The plan is to rendezvous with a number of warships on Memory and then head to Alnitak. My superiors received word from the admiral on Farpoint that there are a number of Navy ships at the ready to avenge their fallen comrades, so I expect we'll pick up some help there when we refuel. After the fleet is mustered, we go to Arneb." He smiles tensely, adding, "Just make sure that the <npc> makes it onto the planet. She'll be carrying the landing crew, along with myself."`
	"CN-1070" `	The communications device on his belt rings, and he quickly responds, giving orders to the fleet that will be joining you on the mission. Before you can return to your ship, he says, "Good luck, Captain, and may we all make it out of this alive. We'll meet you in orbit."`
	"CN-1071" `As you land, you notice a group of Deep Security warships - three Aeries and their fighter squadrons - loading munitions just outside of the spaceport. Before you can make it into the spaceport, one of the pilots waves you over for a brief conversation: aside from a few trivial items left on their preflight checklist, the warships are ready to launch and join in on the rescue mission.`
	"CN-1072" `While refueling at the Farpoint Navy base, you are approached by two Navy officers who recognize you as Captain <last>. They tell you that Lieutenant Paris contacted them a few days ago, indicating that the rescue fleet was en route and would be reaching the Alnitak system shortly. They inform you that they have requisitioned two Cruisers to assist in the Star Queen's retrieval, and depart for their ships.`
	"CN-1073" `The remaining fleet quickly enters the atmosphere of Haven and begins scanning the surface. After roughly an hour of flying, you receive a transmission that the Star Queen has been found, along with its coordinates.`
	"CN-1074" `	You watch from afar as the Mule lands outside a hangar in some sort of pirate facility. The Mule immediately unloads what looks to be at least four dozen armed soldiers who quickly surround and breach the hangar. "Lieutenant, they have alien technology in here," one of the soldiers says over the radio. "Some of it is from the Hai, but some of it I've never seen before."`
	"CN-1075" `	"Plant explosives on any alien technology you find. We don't have the capabilities to take it all back with us. It's better off destroyed."`
	"CN-1076" `	After fifteen minutes, the hangar doors slide open to reveal the Star Queen, still intact. You hear chatter over the radio saying that most of the crew and scientists are still inside.`
	"CN-1077" `	"Good job, everyone," you hear Lieutenant Paris say over the comms. "Now we just need to make it back to <destination> in one piece." Just as he says that, a bright light pierces the sky, obliterating the Mule while its shields are down. Soldiers begin scrambling into the Star Queen, which quickly takes off into space along with the rest of the fleet. You turn your repulsor engines to full and begin flying up into space behind them as multiple explosions come from the facility behind you.`
	"CN-1078" `"Bondir" Atomic Thruster`
	"CN-1079" `"Bufaer" Atomic Steering`
	"CN-1080" `After the Bactrian is eliminated, you receive a transmission from an unknown source. It suddenly opens on its own and an electronically distorted voice begins speaking to you.`
	"CN-1081" `	"Well done, Captain. Well done at being a thorn in my side. You will pay for this. One day."`
	"CN-1082" `The transmission cuts out as abruptly as it had started.`
	"CN-1083" `As you land near the Star Queen, you can see its passengers being escorted off. Hannah comes running off the ship in tears over to Garrison, who must have arrived as soon as he heard the news. A medical team is examining each passenger while a Deep Security officer asks questions and jots down the responses. Sadly, you also notice a number of body bags next to the ship, likely from scientists or crew that were found dead on the ship.`
	"CN-1084" `	Lieutenant Paris is waiting for you outside of your ship, and hands you another <payment> when you walk up to him. "Thanks for all the help, Captain <last>. We couldn't have done it without you."`
	"CN-1085" `	Paris looks back to the Star Queen, and you can overhear one of the Deep Security officers listing off names. "Sarah Reevs, Nicole Faye, Pierre Joules, Laura Paris..." the list goes on for slightly over a dozen total names. "The surviving crew tells us that only a few were killed initially, either during boarding or by being thrown out the airlock on the way to Haven. Most of the others were either killed or dragged off after they had reached their destination at a facility of some sort, its purpose unidentifiable to the crew."`
	"CN-1086" `	When you look back to Lieutenant Paris, you notice that he is holding back tears. Laura Paris was one of the scientists who died.`
	"CN-1087" `	He talks to you in a rather strained voice. "I want you to return to Arneb and take out every single one of those pirates that are left. Especially the Bactrian. We try to keep Bactrians out of unworthy hands, so whenever a pirate gets one we make sure we destroy it immediately. Seeing as how we're going to be busy here for a while, you need to be the one who destroys it."`
	"CN-1088" `	"I'll make sure it gets done, Lieutenant."`
	"CN-1089" `	"I'm sorry, but I don't have the power to defeat that Bactrian. You're going to need to do it yourself."`
	"CN-1090" `	"I see... Good luck on your travels, Captain <last>." Lieutenant Paris starts walking over to the Star Queen, leaving you alone next to your ship.`
	"CN-1091" `	"Thank you, <first>." Lieutenant Paris starts walking over to the Star Queen, leaving you alone next to your ship.`
	"CN-1092" `When you return to Valhalla, the Star Queen is no longer on the landing pad and the spaceport seems to be running normally. Shortly after landing, you find Lieutenant Paris at the same restaurant in which he first found you. Before saying a word to you, he hands you a license.`
	"CN-1093" `	"Thank you. I've said it before, but there's really no way I can thank you enough."`
	"CN-1094" `	You look down at the license that Paris just handed you and notice that it's a city-ship license, one that will allow you to purchase the Bactrian. "I think it's only fair that you be able to purchase one after having to fight one to the death, and the government of the Deep agrees. It's really the least I... we could do for you."`
	"CN-1095" `	"Thank you so much! I'll make sure that this gets put to good use."`
	"CN-1096" `	"Really? You shouldn't have."`
	"CN-1097" `	"It's yours to keep. I hope you have good luck with your travels, and have fun using the Bactrian. It's a mighty fine ship to fly." Lieutenant Paris pays his bill and leaves, as you ponder the possibilities that await.`
	"CN-1098" `	He turns to you and hands you a license, then says in a rather strained voice. "Thank you. I've said it before, but there's really no way I can thank you enough."`
	"CN-1099" `	"It's yours to keep. I hope you have good luck with your travels, and have fun using the Bactrian. It's a mighty fine ship to fly." Lieutenant Paris starts walking over to the Star Queen, leaving you alone to ponder the possibilities that await.`
	"CN-1100" `Helheim's spaceport has all the constant hustle and bustle of a boomtown. It's dirty, lively, and packed with workers. As you walk through the spaceport, an aged man in a worn and weathered roustabout jacket waves his arm toward you and approaches you.`
	"CN-1101" `	"You've got the look of one who knows a ship inside and out," he says. "Name's Skaldgar, ain't much for ships; earth, soil, and rock are my domain. But I do got a need to travel." He pauses as a wistful look briefly passes over his face. "I left, you see, decades ago. No goodbye. No note. Just... left. Living with others, taking care of others, hard on a man like me. I like solitude, peace, and work. But now my bones are brittle: the radiation, earth-rot as we call it, has taken hold and my time is running out. And I find, I don't want to be alone anymore."`
	"CN-1102" `	He stops and frowns. "Look at me, rambling like an ol' man. Ser, Captain, I'd like to pay you <payment> to take me home, to <destination>."`
	"CN-1103" `	"If you have coin, I have room."`
	"CN-1104" `	"I guess I can take a small detour."`
	"CN-1105" `	"Why are you calling me 'ser'?"`
	"CN-1106" `	"Does 'ser' just apply to men?"`
	"CN-1107" `	"Is 'ser' different from 'sir'?"`
	"CN-1108" `	(Shake my head. I have better things to do than bus old men around.)`
	"CN-1109" `	He nods, grunts, and heads to your ship with a small knapsack cradled under his arm, clearly ready to travel to <planet> at a moment's notice.`
	"CN-1110" `	"You're not from around here, are ya? Ser's just what decent folk call each other in the Deep. Sign of respect and the like. Though I am hearing it less and less these days. Old ways being forgotten, but ain't that the way of things?"`
	"CN-1111" `	He pauses for a moment as if reflecting on this, then says, "Well, what do you say? <payment> for transportation to <planet>?"`
	"CN-1112" `	The old man narrows his eyes at you and his mouth falls slightly open like he's trying to make sense of a puzzle. Finally he says, "What's the bits between a fella's legs gotta do with anything? I already said, 'Ser' is just what decent folk call each other; ain't nothing more to it. Don't matter if you're a guy, gal, or anything else. Hel, I reckon I'd even call an elf 'Ser' if they done me a good turn.`
	"CN-1113" `	The old man gives you a gruff nod and says, "Ah, I see. Can be confusing for a newcomer, I s'pose. What's 'tween a fella's legs gots nothing to do with it. Just like I said before, 'Ser' is just what decent folk call each other; ain't nothing more to it. Don't matter if you're a guy, gal, or anything else. Hel, I reckon I'd even call an elf 'Ser' if they done me a good turn.`
	"CN-1114" `	"Now, I'd like to know whether you can take me to <planet>."`
	"CN-1115" `	With a disappointed look on his face, he nods once and slides back into the endless sea of people.`
	"CN-1116" `	"I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. Comin' home, even if I'm hated - or worse, forgotten - ain't one of them. Thank ya kindly for the passage."`
	"CN-1117" `	You wish the old codger a joyful homecoming, and watch as he disappears into the sleepy spaceport.`
	"CN-1118" `In the nearly abandoned spaceport of Norn, a scruffy and slow-moving figure shuffles toward you. "Captain <first>! Good to see you, friend. It's Skaldgar; ya gave me a ride here some time ago," he calls out as he approaches you.`
	"CN-1119" `	"Got a nephew who works at the port, let me know he saw you comin' in." He claps you on the back. "Things have been mostly good, hard though, the family - some are glad to see me, to remember me, and others..." he pauses. "Well, some mistakes you just can't take back."`
	"CN-1120" `	He looks away briefly, and then nods at his packed bag. "It was good to come back here one last time. But the soil, the work calls to me. I'm only good at one thing in this world, and I intend to do it to the very end. So, I was wonderin', could ya take me back to <planet>?"`
	"CN-1121" `	(Nod. Skaldgar and his hard-earned money are more than welcome aboard my ship.)`
	"CN-1122" `	"No thanks. I have better things to do than bus old men around."`
	"CN-1123" `	Skaldgar glares at you briefly then shrugs. "S'pose you do. S'pose you do." He turns and wanders away.`
	"CN-1124" `	Skaldgar rewards you with a genuine, if uneven, smile and then picks up his pack to board your ship.`
	"CN-1125" `	Just as he is about to be swept up in the current of humanity, Skaldgar turns and gives you one last wave, and then is gone.`
	"CN-1126" `As always, Helheim is packed to the brim with transient workers coming and going, with dreams of either getting rich or getting out. A youngish looking man in a dirty roustabout jacket waves at you and approaches.`
	"CN-1127" `	"Yer that Cap'n that Skaldgar always went on about, aren'tcha?" The young man attempts to imitate Skaldgar with a deep and ponderous voice, "Him that knows the currents of space like we know our stone, and the like." The man grins sheepishly, "Ol' Skaldgar always had a way with words, he did."`
	"CN-1128" `	The young man then looks down, somberly, and pulls from his pocket a small, well-worn stone with some strange markings on it and holds it out to you.`
	"CN-1129" `	"He wanted," he begins haltingly, "he wanted you, only you, to take this back to his folk on Norn." He swallows. "It's the old ways, it is. This, it needs to be returned, and not by a stranger." The young man then shrugs. "Best to let'cha know, I ain't have no money to pay you. This would be a favor for the ol' man."`
	"CN-1130" `	(Reach out and accept the stone.)`
	"CN-1131" `	"Nope. Not going to do it. I run a ship, not a charity."`
	"CN-1132" `	The young man nods knowingly. "Guess Skaldgar was wrong about you, but I understand. We all gotta eat." He turns and slides back into the endless crowd.`
	"CN-1133" `	You're surprised at how cool the smooth stone feels in your palm.`
	"CN-1134" `	He smiles sadly. "Skaldgar always had a nose for good folks. Anyways, he told me he had a nephew named Helm who worked at the Norn spaceport. Find 'im and he can get'cha and this stone where it needs to go." The young man then looks you in the eye and gives a slow respectful nod, "For Ol' Skaldgar, may he be findin' ore in hel."`
	"CN-1135" `	And with that, the man disappears into the crowd.`
	"CN-1136" `	"I figured for you to be returning, it would either be with Skaldgar or with" - he pauses - "news." He looks around. "And I don't see Skaldgar."`
	"CN-1137" `	You show him the odd stone you'd been given, and Helm stiffens then nods. "As I figured. Best we meet in the spaceport to discuss what comes next."`
	"CN-1138" `Helm meets you in the nearly deserted spaceport bar. "Ma always had a soft spot for Uncle Skaldgar. Even after he ran off 35 years ago, she still spoke fondly of him. He always sent the family money, he was good like that. Not as good, though, in sending his love."`
	"CN-1139" `	Helm sighs, "This is going to be tough, but as bearer of the Stone, you are going to need to present it to his son. His family lives on a drifting algae island to the south of here. Are you willing to accompany me?"`
	"CN-1140" `	"I've come this far. I might as well finish it."`
	"CN-1141" `	"Absolutely, I want to see this through."`
	"CN-1142" `	"No, This is as far as I go. I got the stone to you, and it's your problem now."`
	"CN-1143" `	Helm nods, knowingly, "Fair enough, star-traveler. I will handle it from here."`
	"CN-1144" `	Helm smiles when you agree to accompany him. "This is right," he says.`
	"CN-1145" `	After making a few preparations, he leads you out to the harbor, where you climb aboard a small ocean-going craft that you assume belongs to him. He works on the controls for a bit and then sits down across from you as the ship veers out into the open ocean.`
	"CN-1146" `	"It's an old custom," he says, nodding toward the stone in your hand. "Goes back to the founding of The Deep, the first settlers. On a person's 16th birthday they are given a stone to carry with them through their lives. On special, or momentous occasions, they are to carve a few runes into it, a few cherished memories chiseled into hard stone."`
	"CN-1147" `	Helm pauses as a flock of jabbering sea-birds passes near the ship, indicating a nearby island, and then continues. "And then when that person dies, that stone is returned by the closest family member to the Family-Cairn."`
	"CN-1148" `	Helm looks up and his eyes scan the horizon. "We're almost there; gather your things." Helm stands and returns to the ship's controls.`
	"CN-1149" `	"But why do I have to be the one to bring the stone to his son?"`
	"CN-1150" `	"Where do the stones come from?"`
	"CN-1151" `	Helm shrugs as he maneuvers the ship into dock. "It is the old way. To make certain the stone is not lost, mishandled, or acquired by enemies. If the family is not near when its owner passes, it is given to a trusted friend who becomes its bearer. That task is too important and too sacred to be given to a stranger or courier. For you to take it all the way to his son, so that he may return it to earth, is right."`
	"CN-1152" `	Helm shrugs as he maneuvers the ship into dock. "Wherever makes the most sense at the time a stone is given. If I recall correctly Skaldgar's stone was given to him by his mother, my grandmother, from an old mine Skaldgar had been exploring on the mainland. Even at 16 he loved the earth."`
	"CN-1153" `	Helm ties up the ship at a makeshift dock and you follow him toward a dour gray building not far away. You realize this entire algae island, as small as it is, must belong to a single individual or family.`
	"CN-1154" `	When you arrive at the hardy and sea-stained wooden door, Helm knocks thunderously upon it and calls out, "Thorleif, open up!"`
	"CN-1155" `	After a brief wait the door opens ponderously, revealing a large, red-bearded, middle aged man who looks like a younger and much healthier Skaldgar. You realize that you must be standing before the man's son. A wide and open grin forms on his face when he sees Helm, and he gives the man a warm embrace. "Ah cousin! It's been too long, what brings you to my humble home?"`
	"CN-1156" `	Thorleif then notices you and frowns. "And who have you brought with you?"`
	"CN-1157" `	(Answer for myself.)`
	"CN-1158" `	(Let Helm answer for me.)`
	"CN-1159" `	You smile somberly at Thorleif. "I was a friend of Skaldgar. I gave him a ride a few times, and, most recently, was entrusted with his stone."`
	"CN-1160" `	Helm puts a hand on Thorleif's shoulder. "This here is <first>, they've come a long way to see you, and to bring you Skaldgar's stone."`
	"CN-1161" `	Thorleif tenses up. "Never speak that name!" His eyes narrow. "Helm, I want nothing to do with that stone, this person," Thorleif says, gesturing toward you, "or whatever else that old man wanted or cared about."`
	"CN-1162" `	Thorleif glances toward the horizon as he clenches and unclenches his fists, taking a few slow breaths, regaining his composure. "I realize you have traveled far and would not be able to get back to the mainland before night. So you may stay in the guest quarters, and leave first thing in the morning. I will have no one say that Thorleif was inhospitable."`
	"CN-1163" `	(Keep quiet and follow Helm towards the guest rooms.)`
	"CN-1164" `	(Try to say something on Skaldgar's behalf.)`
	"CN-1165" `	"Wait," you say before Thorleif can stomp off. "I do not, could not, know all that has happened here, that has gone on between you and your father. But I know that every time I met him he clearly regretted whatever happened, and constantly spoke of his mistakes. He's gone now, mistakes and all, and this stone... I don't think it represents forgiveness, but maybe acceptance of who he was, and that now he is gone."`
	"CN-1166" `	Thorleif turns to you, his face flashing red, and speaks through clenched teeth, "I have no father. I have no memories of such a man, and I will make no effort to remember someone who didn't stick around long enough to know me. Now, go to your rooms and leave me be!"`
	"CN-1167" `	You quietly follow Helm to two small, sparsely decorated rooms, clearly intended for guest use. Helm clears his throat, "This may surprise you, but that actually went better than I thought it would."`
	"CN-1168" `	Helm then turns his attention to a small window and the darkening horizon beyond it. "Dark clouds are gathering, I fear we may be here longer than a single night."`
	"CN-1169" `	(Head off to bed as the first rains begin to patter against the roof.)`
	"CN-1170" `	You awake to the riotous din of hard rain crashing against the building. As Helm predicted, a powerful storm blew in during the night, the floating island besieged by savage weather. By midmorning, the walls are starting to creak as howling forces of nature bash against it unceasingly.`
	"CN-1171" `	You hear a door open and struggle to close, followed by the sound of heavy sloshing footsteps. Thorleif, soaked to the bone, stands before you and Helm in the main room. "It's a Fimbulhrithr," Thorleif exclaims, "One of the worst I've yet seen. If we do not act quickly it could well flatten everything on this isle. Will you help me?"`
	"CN-1172" `	(Offer to help Thorleif.)`
	"CN-1173" `	"No, I've done enough for this family already. Especially for free!"`
	"CN-1174" `	Thorleif growls, "Knew better than to trust a friend of that useless old man. I gave you a place to sleep, and now you won't lift a hand to save it? I should have expected no less!" Thorleif and Helm hurry off to tend to the island during the storm, leaving you idle inside.`
	"CN-1175" `	Thorleif and Helm heroically use the island's metal rudder and rudimentary engine to steer it away from the storm and to calmer, safer seas. However, with only the two of them many of the out-buildings are destroyed, along with a few of the small watercraft Thorleif used to fish and work on.`
	"CN-1176" `	You get the impression that this is an expensive and major loss for Thorleif. The moment the winds are calm, he demands Helm take you back to the mainland and your ship. "This Captain," Thorleif says, his voice oozing with disgust, "is just as lucky as my so-called father. I want him gone."`
	"CN-1177" `	For most of the trip back to your ship, Helm says nothing. He has been cool to you ever since you refused to help save the island. Finally, as you are preparing to disembark from his ship, he stops you. "You've done Skaldgar no favors here. I'd appreciate it if we don't see from you again."`
	"CN-1178" `	Helm holds up his hand showing off the stone in his palm. "I took it while you were napping. Skaldgar made a mistake with you, and I will at least see the stone properly tended. Goodbye." Helm indicates toward the exit and waits for you to depart before casting off again in his ship.`
	"CN-1179" `	Thorleif nods and takes you and Helm outside into the storm, or Fimbulhrithr. Thorleif and Helm work the island's metal rudder and rudimentary engine to steer the island away from the storm, while you are given the task of tying everything down that is liable to fly away.`
	"CN-1180" `	With the storm comes unnatural darkness, and the sky is filled with debris and fish and all manner of items that do not belong in it. You hurry as fast as you can, saving as much as possible.`
	"CN-1181" `	After hours of hard work, the storm begins to subside, and the sea and sky begin to calm. An exhausted Thorleif and Helm stagger over to you, and Thorleif surveys his small island. "Without your help I would have lost much of what stands intact. It was a lucky thing you came when you did."`
	"CN-1182" `	With that, he turns and heads back to the main dwelling, with you and Helm in tired tow.`
	"CN-1183" `	(Wash up and warm up in the main room around the fire.)`
	"CN-1184" `	You spend the evening warming yourself by a roaring fire, telling Helm and Thorleif tales of your exploits in space and many of the wonders you've seen.`
	"CN-1185" `	In turn, they tell you about the sea beasts, leviathans, and krakens that they have met on the ocean currents of Norn. Of lost isles filled with forgotten treasure or strange people, or stories even, about the ancient elves who once aided their ancestors and are said to be around still.`
	"CN-1186" `	(Ask about the elves.)`
	"CN-1187" `	(Ask about lost treasure.)`
	"CN-1188" `	The idea of Elves, or Alfar as they call them, intrigues you, and you ask what they know of them.`
	"CN-1189" `	"The Alfar," Thorleif begins, "are said to have been a great help to us in the early days. Some say they spared us from plagues and protected us from monsters. Many still offer sacrifices and prayers to them, so that they remember us and know that we are friends and allies still."`
	"CN-1190" `	Thorleif shrugs. "This may be true, and good at that, but others think the Alfar, for all their apparent good works, cannot be trusted. Their minds are unknowable and filled with mischief, and their aims are not ours. This is the belief that our family holds to. They should be respected, but also feared. We must look to each other for support and strength, and trust not in the deeds of strangers."`
	"CN-1191" `	You could always use a little extra money, and this trip, while engaging, has certainly not made you any richer, so you ask about hidden treasures. Helm and Thorleif both grin at this and glance at each other knowingly. They launch into tales of the riches of lost civilizations, or forgotten pirate hoards, or even early human kingdoms. It's easy to lose things on a fog-covered ocean world with floating islands, all too easy.`
	"CN-1192" `	When they are done regaling you with tales, they mention to you that maybe some other time they'll take you out into the deep ocean and perhaps you'll find what you're looking for. They smile wolfishly at that, and you think they might be putting you on. "Have you ever found treasure out here?" you ask.`
	"CN-1193" `	Thorleif shrugs. "Coming here... from Alfheim long ago, our antecedents felt that the world itself was the real treasure. We have no need to go chasing dreams in the abyss."`
	"CN-1194" `	As the conversation winds down and the hour grows late Helm excuses himself to bed, for he, like the rest of you, is dog tired after the day's events. You stand too, feeling your own need for sleep.`
	"CN-1195" `	"<first>," Thorleif says without looking up from the fire. "I've been thinking. I can never forgive my father for what he did. Leaving me and mom like that. But I can, I think, make peace with it. I can accept the stone." He looks up and smiles, "You brought some luck with you, and a man should never argue with luck."`
	"CN-1196" `	He stands up. "We'll talk in the morning."`
	"CN-1197" `	(Head to bed for some well deserved sleep.)`
	"CN-1198" `	The day is bright and the sky is clear, the storm long forgotten as you prepare your things. Both men meet you in the main room. Thorleif opens up his hand to accept the stone, which you gladly place into it. He smiles and looks it over, tracing his finger along its chiseled runes.`
	"CN-1199" `	"Thank you, <first>." You nod, happy to be done with this mission and free to fly the space lanes once more.`
	"CN-1200" `	"Just more thing," Thorleif adds with a sly grin. "I'll need a captain willing to ferry me to Alfheim. That's where my family's cairn is located."`
	"CN-1201" `	Before you know it, the three of you are on Helm's boat and heading for the spaceport.`
	"CN-1202" `	"Alfheim," Thorleif says idly, "you know of it? The name means the home of the Alfar, or elves as you call them. I've never been there, only heard of it. It'll be strange to visit the world of my ancestors."`
	"CN-1203" `	Helm stays behind as you and Thorleif load your gear onto your ship.`
	"CN-1204" `	You're not sure exactly how you got mixed up into all this, and yet, it all feels right to you. Like you are where you should be, doing what you should do. This adventure may not involve intergalactic wars or the secrets of the ancients, but sometimes it really is just about people. People like Skaldgar and Thorleif and Helm.`
	"CN-1205" `The journey to Alfheim was interesting, if uneventful. Thorleif had never been in space before, and every jump left him quite ill. At the same time, however, he found so much wonder in it: seeing the dark void and bright stars with his own eyes; watching the tiny worlds recede into the distance. You could, through his eyes, experience the wild adventure of space anew.`
	"CN-1206" `	Throughout the trip, he told you stories of his family: They were called the Hlewagast and originally settled as some of the first colonists on Alfheim in the early history of The Deep. How they had been explorers and adventurers before taking land here to settle down on and work. How his great grandparents had decided to leave Alfheim, dismayed by the rampant pillaging of resources and looking once more for adventure, and how they had come to Norn. Seeking the waves, and the storms, and the solitude.`
	"CN-1207" `	Through all of this, you got a better feel for Thorleif, Skaldgard and his people, and are almost sorry when your ship approaches Alfheim.`
	"CN-1208" `	On landing, you are surprised by how much Alfheim reminds you of Helheim. Though the environment and ecology of the worlds are remarkably different, both are primarily used for resource extraction, and thus filled with boomtown employees and migrants looking for work, chasing dreams, and trying to make their way in the world.`
	"CN-1209" `	Thorleif points to the spaceport. "Let's see if we can find a guide in there. There's a village we'll need to find, assuming it even exists anymore and hasn't been abandoned or destroyed to make room for a new oil rig."`
	"CN-1210" `Thorleif is clearly uncomfortable being in a place so jam-packed with people. You help him keep his bearings and work your way to a young woman managing a visitor kiosk in the Spaceport.`
	"CN-1211" `	The woman looks up with a tired, practiced smile. "Welcome to Alfheim. Are you looking for work, or looking for a specific rig site? Please be aware that proof of employment is required before I can give you any details on company rigs."`
	"CN-1212" `	Thorleif shakes his head. "Lady, no. We're not... anyone's employees, nor do we need work here. I am looking for a village, hamlet really, called Grimssalr. It's where my folk come from."`
	"CN-1213" `	The woman frowns for a second then seems to break from a trance as real warmth washes over her face. "I am sorry, it's just been so long since I've dealt with people who weren't looking for work. Alfheim, well, it is what it used to be, but only just more so now." She shrugs, "I know of Grimssalr though. I'm actually from Lindsvoll, in the same valley."`
	"CN-1214" `	"So can you tell us where it is?" Thorleif asks earnestly. The woman smiles shyly at Thorleif. "Tell you? How about I take you there?"`
	"CN-1215" `	(Invite her onboard.)`
	"CN-1216" `	(Reject the offer.)`
	"CN-1217" `	You start to say that it isn't necessary for her to accompany you, when Thorleif cuts you off. "That sounds great!"`
	"CN-1218" `	She smiles broadly at Thorleif and nods.`
	"CN-1219" `	(Sigh and shake my head.)`
	"CN-1220" `	She immediately abandons her kiosk and shrugs. "I didn't care much for that job anyways."`
	"CN-1221" `	You and Thorleif follow her to a local transit hovercraft, where she and Thorleif quickly sit together. You find yourself sitting alone.`
	"CN-1222" `	For the next three hours, it sounds as if they are in deep conversation, while you drift in and out of sleep watching as oil fields give way to rainforests and then rainforests shrink before great wooded mountains.`
	"CN-1223" `	At some point you feel Thorleif shaking your shoulder. "We're here."`
	"CN-1224" `	(Rise from my seat.)`
	"CN-1225" `	The town of Grimssalr is nestled along the foothills of the towering Ettin mountains in western Alfheim. Town is perhaps too generous a word; it is instead more like a couple dozen houses filled with old people long abandoned by their children seeking wealth and adventure elsewhere.`
	"CN-1226" `	The woman, who you've learned is named Ragnhild, introduces Thorleif to some of the folks here, and before long they have found ways to connect their ancient genealogies together and everyone is suddenly treated as family. Before you know it, you are eating their meager yet hearty fare, swapping stories of adventures, and listening to legends about the old times.`
	"CN-1227" `	As the sun begins to set, Thorleif approaches you, "It is time," he says. "The journey to the cairn is only a short hike from here. I would like you to accompany me. I think Skaldgar would have wanted that."`
	"CN-1228" `	(Accompany Thorleif.)`
	"CN-1229" `	"It's best that you do this alone."`
	"CN-1230" `	Thorleif frowns. "I cannot. It does not feel right. It is only because of you that I am here at all. I need you by my side to finish this. For me, and for him."`
	"CN-1231" `	"I am sorry. But I will not go."`
	"CN-1232" `	Thorleif's face reddens and he abruptly turns from you. He has no words left to argue with and leaves you to wait in the village.`
	"CN-1233" `	A short time later he returns, his eyes wet and red.`
	"CN-1234" `	"I have made my peace, I have read the runes of his life and returned his stone to the Family-Cairn of Hlewagast. He had few happy moments, and the only recent ones involved us both. He is gone now, and we remain." Thorleif wipes tears from his eyes. "Let us rest, and eat, and drink for a time. Skaldgar would have liked that, too."`
	"CN-1235" `	You follow Thorleif up a mostly overgrown trail for about half an hour before finally stepping out into a wide open plain. The wind is cool and refreshing, and the grass blows with a steadiness that is somehow reassuring. There is something special and timeless about this meadow.`
	"CN-1236" `	You notice over two dozen columns of stone arranged in a circle around a much more massive and impressive structure - a wall cut from some sort of metal you don't recognize. It is covered with letters and images that are unfamiliar to you.`
	"CN-1237" `	"That is an Elf-Stone. It is why we built our Family-Cairns here. Such stones can be found on most worlds in The Deep. Indestructible, and left by the Alfar for some unknowable reason. Some, like this one, have been mostly forgotten. Others though, are important places of celebration and even worship."`
	"CN-1238" `	He points at a smallish cairn next to the Elf-Stone. "This, though, is what we're here for."`
	"CN-1239" `	You eye the worn and weather-beaten cairn with a faded name plate that has 'Hlewagast' carved into its base.`
	"CN-1240" `	Thorleif approaches the cairn.`
	"CN-1241" `	Thorleif holds up the stone of his father in his palm and begins to read the runes carved upon it.`
	"CN-1242" `	"The day my mother gave me this stone and said she was proud of me."`
	"CN-1243" `	"The day my son Thorleif was born."`
	"CN-1244" `	"The day I struck the mother lode on Helheim."`
	"CN-1245" `	"The day I met <first>, who helped me find my family again."`
	"CN-1246" `	"The day I saw my son again, even though he would not see me."`
	"CN-1247" `	Thorleif sniffs, takes a moment to write down something he saw on the stone, and then walks forward and places it upon the cairn, at home now with hundreds of other stones each with their own handful of memories.`
	"CN-1248" `	"He had not so many good memories, I think," Thorleif said quietly. "I realize now that mine too are quite few. Perhaps that, if nothing else, is a lesson he can teach me. For that I thank you, father."`
	"CN-1249" `	With that, Thorleif turns from the cairn with teary eyes. "It is done. Let us head back."`
	"CN-1250" `	(Follow Thorleif back to the village.)`
	"CN-1251" `	The two of you trudge back to the small hamlet of Grimssalr, with its people happy at having guests and long lost relatives, and to Ragnhild, happy to spend more time with Thorlief, where you feast and talk and laugh and remember.`
	"CN-1252" `	You enjoy yourself well into the evening before Thorleif approaches you. It's time to head back.`
	"CN-1253" `	"This place," Thorleif begins, "this world, it feels like it has forgotten its soul. Industry and greed have taken hold, and the old happy places like Grimssalr are dying. It is good my family left here all those years ago. Norn is, and has been, a good place to be."`
	"CN-1254" `	Thorleif then nods to Ragnhild. "Which is also why my very new and very dear friend Ragnhild has decided to join us on the return trip to Norn." You look to Ragnhild but somehow you can't feel that you're surprised at the news.`
	"CN-1255" `	She smiles brightly. "Best offer I've had in a long time." The three of you board your ship and prepare for the journey home.`
	"CN-1256" `The trip back to Norn was restful.`
	"CN-1257" `	You spent most of it listening to Ragnhild tell the old stories and legends of Alfheim that she had learned as a child.`
	"CN-1258" `	Stories about alien trees whispering dark secrets, of oil barons destroying sacred sites and being cursed by alien artifacts they were too blinded by greed to see, and even tales of the elves and miracles of the Elf-Stones.`
	"CN-1259" `	Again, as before, you're almost sad when you make it back to Norn. The time for telling stories has ended, and the time for saying goodbye has begun.`
	"CN-1260" `	Thorleif wraps you in a bear hug. "I thank you for all you have done, <first>. I was so wound up in my own anger and bitterness I couldn't see anything beyond my own pain. But now, I feel like I can live again. Trust that our meeting has been etched into my own stone. I hope someday you come back and visit us. To remember us small folk on a small world so far from places of power and grand events. Remember you'll always have a home here."`
	"CN-1261" `	With that Thorleif and Ragnhild make their way off your ship. Thorleif only takes a few steps out into the quiet Norn spaceport before stopping suddenly and turning back towards you.`
	"CN-1262" `	"I almost forgot. The old man, well, he had quite a bit of money saved up. I don't think he hardly spent anything on himself. Anyways, I've decided to split the inheritance with you. After taxes, your half comes out to around 500,000 even."`
	"CN-1263" `	Thorleif shrugs, laughs, and walks with Ragnhild hand in hand out into the foggy mists of Norn.`
	"CN-1264" `There is a feeling of deep melancholy in the nearly deserted spaceport. A few plaques adorn the walls, proudly boasting of earlier times when Nifel was a place of relevance in the galactic community. Most are old images of researchers and doctors and their miracle cures.`
	"CN-1265" `	But now this place is a ghost-town, and you walk its empty halls unsure of why you even bothered to explore it in the first place.`
	"CN-1266" `	You turn a corner and find a woman standing near a booth with blown up images of ice-covered scenery. She waves at you excitedly.`
	"CN-1267" `	"Hello, ser! I hope you've been enjoying your stay in our state of the art spaceport! But why stay cooped up in here, when you could be out there?" She gestures toward the windows.`
	"CN-1268" `	"Explore the breath-taking Glaesisvellir ice-plains, or the boiling Slidr river. We'll even take you to the Hrimbrimr valley where the famous Rigellian cure was discovered!`
	"CN-1269" `	"So ser," she continues, "what do you say? Should I sign you up for the VIP Winter-Wonder Excursion Package for a special time limited-only offer of 2,000 credits?"`
	"CN-1270" `	"Sure, I'd love to see more of this world."`
	"CN-1271" `	"No, uh, thanks. Freezing to death in the frigid tundra doesn't sound like a good time to me."`
	"CN-1272" `	The woman frowns, but nods knowingly. "I am afraid, ser, most seem to think the way you do. Still, if you ever run into anyone out there who might be interested, let them know. We could really use the work." With that, she turns and walks briskly back to her booth.`
	"CN-1273" `	The woman's face lights up, and you get the sense that she isn't used to hearing "yes" very often. "Oh, that is wonderful ser, just wonderful!"`
	"CN-1274" `	She puts her finger to her ear and says, "Hjlod, we have a customer! Get the crawler warmed up!" The woman then drops her hand and waves to you. "Right this way, ser! And might I add - you will not be disappointed." She chatters excitedly about the cultural, artistic and scientific merits of the trip as she leads you toward a large pressure hatch.`
	"CN-1275" `	She hits a switch and the hatch opens; she then escorts you into a frigid maintenance dock. A loud, ugly vehicle is whirring at the center of a mess of broken and discarded parts. "There she is!" The woman is nearly shouting as she speaks over the mechanical hum. "We call her Brunhilda, the Queen of the Ice, a most.. durable vehicle, capable of giving you an authentic ice-explorer experience!"`
	"CN-1276" `	The Ice-Crawler, Brunhilda, looks less than dependable to you. It appears to be a run-down, mishmash of parts and jury-rigged technology forced onto a three century old Ice-Crawler, probably used by the original colonists.`
	"CN-1277" `	"Are you sure this thing is safe?"`
	"CN-1278" `	"How old is this thing?!"`
	"CN-1279" `	The woman hesitates. "Don't you worry! Why, that Ice-Crawler is the safest place in all of Nifel! Those other accidents were flukes, and what happened to her sister Ice-Crawler, Gudrun, was entirely unforeseeable."`
	"CN-1280" `	"Well, you know the old saying, 'They don't build 'em like they used to'? It's your lucky day because that is when this was built! Part of the excitement of the tour is riding in an authentic four hundred year old colonial Ice-Crawler."`
	"CN-1281" `	The woman pulls out a small touchscreen. "For very standard liability reasons, I need you to quickly put your digital signature right here. You, or your estate, can't sue us if you're injured or die on the excursion. Furthermore there is no expectation of rescue should you get lost out there, or the Ice-Crawler breaks down." She gives you a small forced smile. "Not that it ever would happen, and like I said, this is a very standard waiver in the tourist trade. I wouldn't think too much about it."`
	"CN-1282" `	She holds up the touchscreen for you to sign.`
	"CN-1283" `	(Key my signature.)`
	"CN-1284" `	"I've changed my mind. I am going to pass on this excursion."`
	"CN-1285" `	The woman's face, red with the cold, looks crest-fallen, but unsurprised, like she was half expecting this outcome. "Brunhilda can be an... intimidating vehicle, it's true. But she is safe ser, I assure you. Either way, I'll take you back to the spaceport."`
	"CN-1286" `	With that, you follow the woman back to the warm and nearly empty spaceport, where she leaves you to return to her forlorn booth.`
	"CN-1287" `	With your signature in hand, the woman's eyes sparkle, and there is a skip in her step as she leads you to the Ice-Crawler. She pulls a lever on the outside of the vehicle that opens a door and releases a ramshackle ramp for you to climb. She indicates that you should walk up the feeble looking ramp. "Hjlod will be your driver and tour-guide for the duration of your excursion. She is waiting for you within. On behalf of Intrepid Ice Adventures Limited, I would like to wish you a happy and safe expedition!"`
	"CN-1288" `	(Board the Ice-Crawler.)`
	"CN-1289" `	The Ice-Crawler, 'Brunhilda,' smells of oil, atmosphere, and perspiration. The confines are tight, with a padded bench area and threadbare seat-belts. There are wires and hard angles everywhere. You're careful not to get tangled in the green, white and blue wires running overhead and into the cockpit. You take a seat and strap in.`
	"CN-1290" `	It is only a little warmer here than it was in the maintenance dock. To your left and right are wide, scratched, and frost-rimmed windows.`
	"CN-1291" `	"Velcome. I am called Hjlod." The thickly accented woman looks back from the driver's seat. She has short blonde hair, and her face and arms are covered in long weaving blue tattoos. "I am from here. I have spent whole life traversing this tundra. I know like back of hand." She gives you a lopsided grin and then pats the steering console. "And Brunhilda here, she never let you down."`
	"CN-1292" `	Hjlod turns away from you and starts pulling some levers. "Now," she says, "let's begin."`
	"CN-1293" `	(Sit back as the motor hums and the Ice-Crawler lurches to a start.)`
	"CN-1294" `	After a few hours of crawling through a bleak, blank wasteland in silence, Hjlod turns the crawler into what looks like a bleaker and blanker wasteland.`
	"CN-1295" `	"This is famous Glaesisvellir ice-plain. Story say once whole convoy of researcher disappear here. Can drill hole in ice for fishing. There is very good tasting voolly octopus beneath it." Hjlod slows down and looks back at you. "You have question?"`
	"CN-1296" `	"What happened to the researchers?"`
	"CN-1297" `	"Is it safe to drive over the ice?"`
	"CN-1298" `	"Are there sea-monsters beneath the ice?"`
	"CN-1299" `	"Nope. No questions."`
	"CN-1300" `	"Long time ago. Researcher convoy look for bacterial pharmaceutical. Many researcher convoy in area. Most smart use native pathfinder, like me. This convoy, they not so smart, they say pathfinder waste of money. They go out in ice alone and they never come back."`
	"CN-1301" `	Hjlod shrugs. "Maybe they fall in ice. Maybe they get eaten by Ice-Slug. Maybe avalanche fall on them. Maybe fall on own veapon and die. Nobody ever find them. Tour-guide book say that some night you can see their ghost haunting ice. Tour-guide book dumb."`
	"CN-1302" `	"Any more question?"`
	"CN-1303" `	"Very safe. Except when not. Ice always frozen, but sometime very thin. I can tell. You cannot. Trust Hjlod and you not drown and get eaten by Ice-Slug."`
	"CN-1304" `	"You have more question?"`
	"CN-1305" `	"Every world have animal. Some animal big, some small. Voolly octopus, mostly small. Size of this Ice-Crawler, only. Vorst in Glaesisvellir ice-plains is Ice-Slug. They can squeeze through tiniest hole in ice. This take long time, for they are as big as house. They have no teeth, too hard to squeeze through little hole, but they have acid spit. Put hole in Ice-Crawler, easy. They eat many foolish researcher and tourist."`
	"CN-1306" `	She smiles at you. "You're not foolish tourist. You are with Hjlod. You are safe."`
	"CN-1307" `	"Is smart, not to ask question. Hjlod tell you best parts only." Hjlod gives you a quick grin and swivels back into her makeshift cockpit. "Enough ice-plain, now ve go to next stop."`
	"CN-1308" `	(Look out at the bright Ice-Plains as they slowly disappear into the dull horizon.)`
	"CN-1309" `	The Ice-Crawler plows through snow, hill, mountain, and tundra for another hour or two before a massive and oddly shaped rock passes into view. Hjlod stops the Ice-Crawler so you can look at it.`
	"CN-1310" `	"This is rock," she says matter-of-factly. You look at it for a while and realize there is a face half chiseled into it.`
	"CN-1311" `	"You are done looking? Ve are good to move to next stop?" Hjlod asks.`
	"CN-1312" `	"Yep, I don't need to look at this rock any longer."`
	"CN-1313" `	"Wait, is that part of a man's face carved into it? What is so special about this rock?"`
	"CN-1314" `	"That rock is supposed to celebrate man who discover Rigellian cure. He was called Hank, or Henry, or Bill, or something." Hjlod shrugs with evident disdain. "The cure was found here, but back when tundra was melting and Nifel was a little varmer. They say this man discover it and they want to make grand statue for him. But it turn out Nifel not so great place for statue. Beside, no one like statue of liar."`
	"CN-1315" `	Hjlod turns back to her controls and gets the Ice-Crawler moving forward again. "That is enough about stupid rock and stupider man.`
	"CN-1316" `	"Now ve go to river," she tells you. The large, oddly shaped rock falls out of your field of view as the Ice-Crawler turns away from it.`
	"CN-1317" `	The uneventful journey to the boiling ice river of Slidr is suddenly interrupted when a deep tremor followed by a thunderous boom shakes the Ice-Crawler to its core and causes it to slip on the disturbed ice and snow. Somewhere outside, subsequent rumble starts to build rapidly. After Hjlod regains control of the crawler, she immediately veers away from the noise. "That vas Nifel-quake, and loud noise was avalanche, or landslide, maybe both. This is not good."`
	"CN-1318" `	Despite her calm demeanor, she wields the Ice-Crawler with reckless abandon as she tries to avoid the rumbling snow. The machine protests with creaks and whirrs and pops as it strains to claw itself out of the way faster than it has probably gone for hundreds of years. The closer the rumbling gets, the more difficulty Hjlod seems to have retaining traction.`
	"CN-1319" `	"I think-" Hjlod starts to say when a mountain of snow crashes into the Ice-Crawler with deafening force. All sense of travelling distance is lost as the snow blots out the windows and the crawler is dragged bumping and twisting over uneven terrain. You and Hjlod hold tight as you're tossed around until, eventually, the crawler grinds up against something reasonably solid and comes suddenly to a rest, partially on its side.`
	"CN-1320" `	A few moments later, the rumbling finishes passing you by.`
	"CN-1321" `	(Unbuckle the seatbelt and get up.)`
	"CN-1322" `	By the time you are on your feet, Hjlod has already gathered up numerous supplies and is preparing to open the hatch and dig her way to the surface. She looks at you. "Nothing to vorry about. Happens all time. Vell, not really. First time this happen, but Hjlod not let you die, probably. I can lead us to settlement not far from here."`
	"CN-1323" `	She tosses you an old, scruffy jacket with a tear along one of its arms. "Valking in cold, good for health. Maybe not as far as ve must go, but you laugh about later. Good story to tell back home."`
	"CN-1324" `	(Put on the jacket and follow Hjlod out onto the ice.)`
	"CN-1325" `	"No way. I am done with this. I am calling my ship, or fixing this Ice-Crawler. Either way, I am not going anywhere."`
	"CN-1326" `	Hjlod shrugs. "You may die, or maybe not. Signals vork strange here at times. Good luck and remember. No refund." With that, Hjlod opens the hatch and disappears in the cold white flurry outside.`
	"CN-1327" `	(Quickly shut the hatch behind her.)`
	"CN-1328" `	Alone, you have a decision to make. You can dismantle portions of the Ice-Crawler and use them to strengthen your personal comms to get a signal out to the <ship>. Or, you can try to repair the Ice-Crawler and get it running again - in which case you wouldn't be able to use its parts to boost your comm signal.`
	"CN-1329" `	(Cannibalize the Ice-Crawler to communicate.)`
	"CN-1330" `	(Try to fix the Ice-Crawler.)`
	"CN-1331" `	You have much more faith in your ship than some antique vehicle. You spend hours ripping once-vital machinery out of the Ice-Crawler in order to make a signal booster for your comms, eventually cobbling together a functional booster and programming a repeating burst S.O.S. message into it.`
	"CN-1332" `You're certain your ship will eventually pick it up. Unfortunately, the damage you've done to the Ice-Crawler has affected its heater, which gives out during your eighth hour of waiting. In the meantime, you put on the jacket Hjlod left you and stuff it with rags and trash in a bid to keep warm.`
	"CN-1333" `	(Try to ignore the cold and get some sleep.)`
	"CN-1334" `	As the hours go by, you lose feeling in your hands and feet. There are no rations, and what stale warmth was once here is now gone. Hopefully, you didn't make a mistake waiting here. You know you made a mistake by going on this miserable tour. You just want to be warm again, and you certainly don't want to die here.`
	"CN-1335" `	You begin to fade in and out of consciousness, when suddenly you feel a deep vibration, and hear a low rumble from outside.`
	"CN-1336" `	There is no memory of what happens next. But somehow you must have crawled out of that ice buried Ice-Crawler, through the snow, and into the hatch of your ship, because the next thing you do remember is laying in your ship, warming up, and being glad that the ordeal is over.`
	"CN-1337" `	After hours of tinkering with the guts of the machine, you manage to repair most of it, and all it costs you is one bad burn on your arm. Now, what it comes down to is a sequence of wires. If you can plug these in correctly, the Ice-Crawler should start back up.`
	"CN-1338" `	(White, green, blue.)`
	"CN-1339" `	(Green, white, blue.)`
	"CN-1340" `	(Blue, green, white.)`
	"CN-1341" `	You're confident that this is the correct sequence of wires. You plug each one in and start the Ice-Crawler up. The vehicle hums to life.`
	"CN-1342" `	(Pump a fist into the air.)`
	"CN-1343" `	(Cheer.)`
	"CN-1344" `	In a moment of levity, you pump your fist into the air.`
	"CN-1345" `	Unfortunately, your fist does not make it very far. The Ice-Crawler, with its criss-crossed wires, has a critical energy build up that results in an instantaneous, completely deadly explosion.`
	"CN-1346" `	The Ice-Crawler, your entire body, your fist, and more than a couple hundred tons of snow are all incinerated in a fraction of a second.`
	"CN-1347" `	The sense of accomplishment inside you is so overwhelming that you find yourself unable to contain it. A cry of pure joy leaps out of your mouth. Or begins to. Unfortunately, it doesn't get too far, as the Ice-Crawler, with its criss-crossed wires, has a critical energy build up that results in an instantaneous, completely deadly explosion.`
	"CN-1348" `	The Ice-Crawler, your entire body, and more than a couple hundred tons of snow are all incinerated in a fraction of a second.`
	"CN-1349" `	With the final cord in place, you hold your breath as you start the Ice-Crawler. The engine hums to life and you wait a few more cautious seconds for the inevitable explosion... which never comes.`
	"CN-1350" `	You breathe easy. You did it! After a few minutes getting accustomed to the controls you manage to pull the Ice-Crawler out of the snow. What will you do now?`
	"CN-1351" `	(Follow Hjlod's tracks.)`
	"CN-1352" `	(Try and find a way to the spaceport.)`
	"CN-1353" `	You've had enough of this expedition. Hjlod said she was fine, and you'll leave it at that. You turn the Ice-Crawler around and make your way back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-1354" `	It only takes a couple hours, and the controls on the Ice-Crawler are relatively easy. When you pull into the maintenance dock, the sales woman comes to meet you and is dismayed that Hjlod is not with you.`
	"CN-1355" `	She hasn't heard from Hjlod and fears the worst. You hope it all works out as you head back to your ship and as far away from this place as possible.`
	"CN-1356" `	Hjlod's tracks are clearly visible in the crisp snow, and you're able to follow them for hours. Just as the second sun is setting, the footprints come to an end at a mound of snow.`
	"CN-1357" `	You leave the vehicle and investigate. You find an exhausted, freezing Hjlod and help her back into the Ice-Crawler. She does not have the strength to speak, and you worry without immediate medical attention that she won't make it.`
	"CN-1358" `	As darkness descends, you see a flickering light in the distance.`
	"CN-1359" `	(Drive toward the flickering light.)`
	"CN-1360" `	(Drive back to the spaceport.)`
	"CN-1361" `	There is no guarantee that the flicker of light is anything more than a waste of time. You turn the Ice-Crawler around and head back toward the spaceport at the fastest speed you dare.`
	"CN-1362" `	Long hours pass and you press on while Hjlod lays unconscious...`
	"CN-1363" `	Finally, in the dead of night you arrive back at the spaceport. Medics swarm your vehicle, and while you learn she'll live, you are also told that she will lose her hands and feet to frostbite. The woman who sold you the excursion thanks you profusely for saving her friend, but still refuses to give you a refund.`
	"CN-1364" `	Exhausted, you drive toward the flickering light and discover it is emanating from a small village.`
	"CN-1365" `	Moments after entering what you assume is the village center, people flock toward your idle vehicle. Before you know it, they have the hatch open and have carried Hjlod out.`
	"CN-1366" `	A young woman, bearing facial tattoos similar to Hjlod, approaches you and escorts you to a communal bunk house for the night. You're too tired to get a handle on what is going on and decide that it can wait for tomorrow.`
	"CN-1367" `	(Sleep now, think later.)`
	"CN-1368" `	You throw on the jacket and stuff a few rags in your coat for good measure.`
	"CN-1369" `	Hjlod nods at you and opens the hatch. "It is only meter to surface."`
	"CN-1370" `	She plunges into the snow and swim-climbs her way up it. You follow her, and though the cold is shocking, you are relieved when you quickly rise above it into the icy clear air above.`
	"CN-1371" `	"Stay close," she says as she begins to trek through the snow. "Any path but mine is dangerous."`
	"CN-1372" `	(Walk in Hjlod's footsteps.)`
	"CN-1373" `	(Meander around.)`
	"CN-1374" `	Hjlod abruptly stops and glares at you. "You are fool. You vill certainly die, and you endanger me in process. This is no game, valk only vhere I valk or die."`
	"CN-1375" `	(Continue to meander.)`
	"CN-1376" `	You walk in your looping meandering pattern, stepping where you want, and not paying any attention to the path Hjlod is taking.`
	"CN-1377" `	You feel righteous vindication as the hours pass and nothing bad happens; proof that Hjlod was just being bossy. She should have no say over what you are doing; it's her fault you're stuck out here stranded on some trash-planet in the blinding cold in the first place.`
	"CN-1378" `	At that thought you do some anger-stomping, really letting her know that you could care less about her worthless warnings. Which is, of course, when you hear a weird gurgling sizzle. You look down at your feet and see there is not packed snow beneath them, but that a gray-purple blob that has wrapped itself around your leg.`
	"CN-1379" `	(Try and shake free.)`
	"CN-1380" `	(Call out to Hjlod for help.)`
	"CN-1381" `	Damn your pride. "Hjlod, help! Something's got my foot!" you cry.`
	"CN-1382" `	Hjlod looks back at you with a dull expression on her face. "Is it purple-gray in color?"`
	"CN-1383" `	"Yes, yes! Quick, help. I don't know what to do."`
	"CN-1384" `	"Vhat you do is listen to Hjlod, and not make stompy circles in snow like spoilt child."`
	"CN-1385" `	"Please, Hjlod!" You cry as the last of your boot dissolves away and you feel the slimy slug on your exposed foot.`
	"CN-1386" `	"It is too late. Ice-Slug has you. Vhat you do now is die. Horribly." Hjlod turns and starts jogging away from you.`
	"CN-1387" `	(Try and pull free.)`
	"CN-1388" `	Despite using all your strength, your leg won't budge. The sizzling noise continues and you are overwhelmed with a sharp horrific burning sensation. Your eyes water and you scream out in pain for help and mercy.`
	"CN-1389" `	You keep pulling, trying to break free. The air thickens with the scent of your liquified foot, and something gives as you fall forward. You look down to see your leg missing from the knee down. You try to push it out of your mind as you desperately claw forward, trying to escape the gray-purple blob that is forming up behind you.`
	"CN-1390" `	Try as you might, you can't cry out Hjlod's name; instead your screams are savage, hollow noises. You reach for her, you reach for anyone, but it's too late. The Ice-Slug has caught up to you, and you feel its acidic tendrils wrapping around your remaining leg and lower torso. The pain is agonizing as your lower body begins to dissolve.`
	"CN-1391" `	You look up one last desperate time, hoping to see Hjlod coming to rescue you, but all you see is a gray smudge on the horizon, a distant person who has long left you for dead. You are alone now with the Ice-Slug and the pain. You consider briefly your mistakes before you are dissolved and eaten.`
	"CN-1392" `	The cold, monotonous trudging weighs on you as the hours pass. You're dimly aware of Nifel's two suns as they make their journey across the wide open sky.`
	"CN-1393" `	Evening and exhaustion approach hand in hand, and as the last sun sets, you're not sure how much farther you can go. "There!" Hjlod breaks the silence of hours as she points at the weak flicker of light in the twilight landscape. "This is good," she admits hoarsely as you both stumble toward the light. "Ve vould have not survived night."`
	"CN-1394" `	The night air grows too cold. You slow as your body begins to shutdown and frostbite gnaws at your hands, feet and exposed arm. The light is still too distant, and you can barely move. You think you see the shadows of humanoid figures against the light. But then you stumble and fall. You crawl for as long as you can. And then nothing.`
	"CN-1395" `	(Wake up.)`
	"CN-1396" `	The pale morning light of the first sun filters in through a synthetic window and onto your face. You try to escape back into sleep, but something feels off and groggily you peer out at your surroundings.`
	"CN-1397" `	The pale morning light of the first sun filters in through a synthetic window and onto your face. Your body aches and you try to sink back into sleep, but something feels off and you focus on your surroundings.`
	"CN-1398" `	You're in a half-wooden, half-synthetic barracks, a strange mix of primitive earth-tech and old colonial architecture. That, in and of itself, isn't that alarming. What is, however, is the group of people gathered around your bed quietly staring and pointing at you.`
	"CN-1399" `	"Excuse me?"`
	"CN-1400" `	The crowd steps back, and an elderly woman steps forward. Her gray hair is rolled up into tight, elegant braids, and her face and hands are covered in faded, blue tattoos.`
	"CN-1401" `	"We are pleased to call you guest. You have saved our daughter, and more; you will save us all." The elderly woman and everyone behind her kneels before you.`
	"CN-1402" `	"Woah, woah, woah! What do you mean 'save us all?'"`
	"CN-1403" `	"Your daughter? Hjlod? Is she alright?"`
	"CN-1404" `	The elderly woman smiles warmly. "It is good of you to ask. Thanks to you, Hjlod will be fine. Had you been any later, she would have lost her hands, or worse. But she is recovering now and will join us later."`
	"CN-1405" `	The elderly woman opens her palms and spreads them wide. "This is village of Udainsakr. I am Ondurdis, or leader, and we are Skadenga, daughters of Skade, the Troll-Goddess of ice, mountains, and cold."`
	"CN-1406" `	"For nearly century we have been waiting for person who bore mark of Skade." She points a tattooed hand at the electric burn on your arm you received while repairing the Ice-Crawler. "It seems we have been waiting for you."`
	"CN-1407" `	"For nearly century we have been waiting for person who bore mark of Skade." She points a tattooed hand at the ice burn on your arm you received while traveling through the snow. "It seems we have been waiting for you."`
	"CN-1408" `	"What do you expect me to do?"`
	"CN-1409" `	"What do you mean a century? How long have you been here? Why were you waiting for me?"`
	"CN-1410" `	The Ondurdis raises an eyebrow. "So you want to know our secrets? We ask much, so I will tell you more than most know. Long ago, the so-called-elves brought the Skadenga to Deep. We had to make penance for some mistakes. Our volva, or seeress, saw that to make amends we must come to Nifel. We did not know why, but when we found the Goddess-Stone, we knew we had made right decision.`
	"CN-1411" `	"Since then, we have lived here and acted as guides and pathfinders to others. It was one of our sisters, Eymani, an herbalist, who discovered the cure to Rigellian plague. We thought this was why we had been sent here. Our duty to act as handmaidens of healing.`
	"CN-1412" `	"With each passing year, Nifel grows colder and outsiders less frequent. Our numbers dwindle as does our usefulness. This is dying world, and we need new home. Eighty years ago one of our holiest sisters had vision. She saw that stranger with mark of Skade would arrive and that stranger would help us find new home."`
	"CN-1413" `	The Ondurdis points a boney finger right at you. "First, you must discover which world will be our home. Then you must find us transportation. We will of course pay you in one way or another. Would you do this for us?"`
	"CN-1414" `	"I'll do it. I won't let you guys down."`
	"CN-1415" `	"No. This isn't my problem. I just need to get back to my ship."`
	"CN-1416" `	The Ondurdis bows and steps back. "If that is your wish, then you must not be the one we wait for." With that, she and everyone else leave the barracks.`
	"CN-1417" `	You climb out of your bunk and head to the Ice-Crawler. From there, you head straight back to the spaceport. The trip takes a few hours and you spend some of it pondering the strange course of events - how you went from a life or death struggle against the elements to being some rustic community's savior.`
	"CN-1418" `	"Oh, well." You say to yourself, "I can't save everyone."`
	"CN-1419" `	You hear the familiar rumble of a shuttle overhead, you climb out of your bunk to go to meet it. From there, you head straight back to the spaceport. The trip is brief, and you have little time to consider all that has transpired since you decided to take the excursion. You worry you may need therapy.`
	"CN-1420" `	The spaceport rises into view, and before you know it you're back safely onboard your ship.`
	"CN-1421" `	The Ondurdis smiles. "Thank you." She nods toward the door. "Come with me."`
	"CN-1422" `	In the light of early day, the village looks stranger than you remember. Carved wooden structures weave flawlessly into sleek fabricated composites in a marriage of ancient with new. Oddly enough, the effect does not clash, but instead gives off an impression of seamless artistry. To the south, there is an open space filled with high-stacked stone cairns. At the center of the space, or holy site, is a giant wall made of an unusual gleaming metal and surrounded by eight ornate wooden pillars. The wall, despite being filled with strange letters and images, is dominated by the single image of a giant humanoid. As you stare into the structure, you feel unnaturally chilly.`
	"CN-1423" `	"That is Goddess-Stone." The Ondurdis gestures toward the large stone-wall. "This is why we settled here. Most worlds in Deep have stones like this upon them. They go by many names; Elf-Stones, God-Stones, Jotun-Stones, and more. Now, at base of wall, those pillars, they are our Setstokkr. They are holy relics of our folk, and guided us here, to this very wall, long ago. Just as they will guide us once more to our new home. There are eight Setstokkr here, but once there was nine."`
	"CN-1424" `	The Ondurdis turns back to you. "You must find the ninth Setstokkr, the missing pillar. It was dropped in space long ago, and we believe based on where it started it could have only found its way to one of two worlds. It either on Windblain in the Regor system, or Asgard in the Naos system." Offering you a small storage device, the Ondurdis continues, "Setstokkr have... unusual properties. This drive contains information that will allow you to track them. Go to these worlds, see if you can find the Setstokkr, and return to us with news. We are eager to know where Skade will send us."`
	"CN-1425" `	The sky glows and the earth rumbles as a shuttle lands not far from the village. "That shuttle will return you to the spaceport and your ship. May Skade guide you." With that, the Ondurdis leaves you.`
	"CN-1426" `	(Head to the shuttle.)`
	"CN-1427" `	(Take a moment to investigate the Goddess-Stone.)`
	"CN-1428" `	You walk toward the park filled with stone cairns, wooden pillars, and the Goddess-Stone.`
	"CN-1429" `	At this distance, you can see that the cairns have name-plates at their bases. Some are so faded and worn you cannot make out the names. Others are easier to read and appear to be family names. Myrlinga, Baning, and Amalung are the few you can read.`
	"CN-1430" `	Beyond the cairns are the well-carved wooden pillars, or Setstokkr as the Ondurdis called them. They are each over 10 meters tall, and all covered entirely in runic script, images, and patterns. A few have unshorn branches that include their own carvings as well, while most are limbless. On one Setstokkr, you notice that a frequent carving within its entwined animals is similar in shape to the burn on your arm.`
	"CN-1431" `	Finally, you reach the massive Goddess-Stone itself. You see now almost no part of the wide surface is bare. There are images within images, letters within letters. These exotic letters bear no relationship to the runes found on the Setstokkr. These are truly alien.`
	"CN-1432" `	A lone figure stands next to the idling shuttle. As you draw closer you recognize Hjlod.`
	"CN-1433" `	"I just vant to thank you." Hjlod's gray-blue eyes glitter in the morning light. "I alvays say Hjlod keep tourist safe. But yesterday you save Hjlod. I vill not forgot, know this."`
	"CN-1434" `	A lone figure stands next to the idling shuttle. As you draw closer, you recognize Hjlod. "You see," she says, "stick with Hjlod, and you live, probably." She holds up a bandaged, three-fingered hand and shrugs. "Mostly."`
	"CN-1435" `	Hjlod offers one of her lopsided grins and then leaves you alone with the shuttle. It is time to go.`
	"CN-1436" `You land on the final world you were asked to visit. Once you're done here, you should return to Nifel.`
	"CN-1437" `	Upon landing, you get a recorded voice message from Hjlod. "<first>, ve're busy evacuating isolated Skadenga communities. Come back in few veeks vhen things settle down."`
	"CN-1438" `	The message abruptly ends.`
	"CN-1439" `In the high-atmosphere of <origin>, your ship's sensors pick up traces of the exotic Setstokkr matter. They pinpoint the material to the southern rim of a sparsely-populated island-continent, in the small coastal settlement of Hrithfjall.`
	"CN-1440" `	Your ship lands just outside the settlement, and you leave with your handheld tracker keyed to the Setstokkr material. The trail goes cold once you enter the settlement. The hamlet Hrithfjall is little more than a few dozen wooden structures along a single overgrown road. The buildings themselves are well-crafted and finely designed, but many of them appear to be abandoned. There are no townsfolk about, but you notice recent footprints headed toward the shore, which you follow.`
	"CN-1441" `	The great seas of Windblain churn beneath the chalk-white cliffs and blue-green sky. As you scan the horizon, your eyes catch the glare of reflected light beyond a distant precipice. You head in that direction and find a figure seated at the precipice's edge. An aged man sits cross-legged, looking out into the sea and at a gleaming metal wall towering over the gray waves about a mile out from shore.`
	"CN-1442" `	The old man speaks without turning and says in a raspy voice, "Hail, stranger. Have you come to pay your respects?"`
	"CN-1443" `	"Pay my respects to what?"`
	"CN-1444" `	"Why, the Ran-Stone, of course." The old man points toward the metal tower in the sea. "Few come here any more. Few remember, or care, about the old ways. But the goddess Ran, she is as patient and as terrible as the sea, and like the sea, she has claimed this world.`
	"CN-1445" `	"So why are you here bothering old Aldfrith, if not to look upon the great countenance of divinity?"`
	"CN-1446" `	"I am called Aldfrith. I live in nearby Hrithfjall, though I spent most my life living on the sea and making every port my home." Aldfrith's eyes glaze over for a moment as he speaks.`
	"CN-1447" `	"But those days are behind me. Now, I mostly sit, think, and live. On the high seas I saw things... things that cannot be explained, that cannot be understood. So, now I sit here, before the great Ran-Stone, the very countenance of divinity, and reflect upon mystery."`
	"CN-1448" `	"So why are you here, if not to pay respect to Ran?"`
	"CN-1449" `	"I am looking for an ornate wooden pillar covered in carvings that fell from space."`
	"CN-1450" `	"Have you seen any old, wooden relics around here?"`
	"CN-1451" `	Aldfrith strokes his white beard for a moment. "The tide brings in all sorts of interesting driftwood. But driftwood from space? That's a tall tale or a deep mystery, that is."`
	"CN-1452" `	He looks up at you with a bemused smirk. "Nope. Nothing like that here. If you're interested in the driftwood though, that gets used for our boats and homes."`
	"CN-1453" `	"Relics, eh?" Aldfrith cackles. "Sailors will always be over-eager to tell a stranger about fantastic treasures in the deep waves."`
	"CN-1454" `	The old man pauses and scratches his head for a moment. "But, alas, I can think of nothing wood-made that would be considered a relic. The salty air and saltier sea don't allow untreated wood to linger long in these parts. Unless it's a boat or a home, your relic is not here."`
	"CN-1455" `	You turn your attention to the great, gleaming metal wall in the sea. Unlike the Goddess-Stone of Nifel, this one has no towering figure upon it. Instead it is more abstract, with fractal swirls and wave-like patterns. As you stare at it, you feel a wildness growing inside your heart that dissipates the moment you look away. You turn, leaving the stone to its wave, and the man to his stone.`
	"CN-1456" `	You run your tracker in Hrithfjall once more, but again it fails to lock onto anything. There are faint diffuse traces of the exotic material all around you, but nothing concrete. There is little more you can learn here at the moment, so you head back to your ship.`
	"CN-1457" `When you enter <planet>'s atmosphere, you receive a message that Hjlod will be waiting for you in the spaceport.`
	"CN-1458" `	Before you have a chance to head into the port however, you are met by a well-dressed administrator and a couple of nondescript guards.`
	"CN-1459" `	"Captain <last>," the administrator says crisply. "You are invited to a meeting in the VIP Conference room. If you would please follow me."`
	"CN-1460" `	"Pass. Have your bosses send me a letter or something, and I'll be sure to get to it in my own time."`
	"CN-1461" `	"No, thanks. I'm actually supposed to be meeting someone."`
	"CN-1462" `	"Sure thing. Lead the way."`
	"CN-1463" `	The guards take you by the arms. "I am pleased you are being so agreeable. Consider this a precaution." The administrator promptly turns, and you all follow.`
	"CN-1464" `	As you try to get around the administrator, his goons grab you. "Respectfully, Captain, this is not an invitation you are at liberty to dismiss."`
	"CN-1465" `	"Ah yes, don't worry. We have the port authority keeping your hill-witch friend busy. You'll likely be done before she is." The administrator nods to his guards, who close in on you.`
	"CN-1466" `	"Regrettably, this is not an invitation you are at liberty to ignore. So let us be on our way, shall we?"`
	"CN-1467" `	You are brought to a large research complex just outside the spaceport, and deposited in a high-end, white, minimalistic conference room with two well-dressed and important looking men. "Thank you, Lars. Take the guards and wait for us outside," the man seated across from you says.`
	"CN-1468" `	"Of course, sir." The administrator, whose name seems to be Lars, turns and is followed outside by his two goons.`
	"CN-1469" `	The man who spoke looks at you with a friendly smile and, without a shred of irony, says, "I am so glad you agreed to meet with us. I realize an accomplished Captain like yourself is in great demand, so we will endeavor to keep this brief."`
	"CN-1470" `	"I am Jakob Forsyth, Vice Planetary-Governor of Nifel and CEO of Nifel-Research Solutions Incorporated, and the man sitting beside me is Henrik Fogel, Deputy Lieutenant-Sub-Director of the Census and Culture Bureau for The Deep. We've been monitoring you ever since you first arrived and became entangled with those sad, backwards, hill-witches." Jakob takes a sip from an elegant glass on the table.`
	"CN-1471" `	"If you've been watching me, does that mean you knew about the Ice-Crawler accident and did nothing?"`
	"CN-1472" `	"Of course I knew." Jakob answers. "It is my business to know. The only people who live here anymore are employees of my firm and those hill-witches." Holding up both hands in a placating gesture, he adds, "And I really am sorry we could not extract you from that avalanche. We don't have the resources allocated to support rescue missions anymore; various services, including emergency ones, are only barely functional. The whole operation on this planet is being shut down, you know. Not enough opportunity to make a profit left here. That's why it will be completely uninhabited within 50 years."`
	"CN-1473" `	"You're abandoning an entire planet?"`
	"CN-1474" `	He leans forward with a sly look on his face. "Think about it. Why employ a worldwide workforce of 300,000 in the vain hope of discovering new pharmaceutical products on a snowy wasteland? There hasn't been a profitable discovery here in generations. It's a money pit. You run a ship, a business, you understand.`
	"CN-1475" `	"There is, however, one hiccup." Jakob leans back. "A thorn that has been in our side since our research firm first colonized this world over 600 years ago. Those crazy hill-witches. Sure, early on they had their uses as guides and whatnot. But, they are a cultural dead end, an atavistic blight on our corporate world. You know," he continues with a humorous glint in his eye, "They actually believe that they were brought here during Earth's stone-age by magical space-fairies."`
	"CN-1476" `	"Now, now." Henrik finally cuts in. "We here in the Deep do value all our resident people and cultures. We are not here to denigrate our citizens, no matter how unusual."`
	"CN-1477" `	"But they're leaving. So what's the problem?"`
	"CN-1478" `	"I thought folk tales of elves were common in the Deep. What makes the Skadenga so different from the rest of you?"`
	"CN-1479" `	Henrik leans back. "Well, you're not wrong. In fact, there's been studies about whether the Skadenga are truly a traditional reflection of the Deep people or an extreme offshoot of what we used to be. Suffice to say, I believe it's the latter, and most modern Deep historians would agree with me.`
	"CN-1480" `	"Here's what really makes them different: our popular folk tales are like the childhood stories you heard of, say, the boogeyman. The Skadenga don't just tell them - they formed a religion out of those stories. If you've spoken with them, I'm sure you can tell that it's quite reminiscent of ancient paganism. Certainly they can practice whatever they want, but we're concerned about some of the usual connotations of paganism. We haven't been able to prove any extreme behavior, but their religion gives us reason to suspect it. If they stay culturally isolated from the rest of the Deep, their religion could progress in ways more... harmful. I'll leave it at that."`
	"CN-1481" `	Henrik clears his throat. "Leaving, yes, but to where? These poor people are in grave need of our help, our public services. Their primitive, superstitious existence is both an embarrassment to the Deep, and a humanitarian crisis that we need to solve."`
	"CN-1482" `	"The Deep would never forcibly resettle a population. But with your help, we have an opportunity to guide them to a place where they could receive the help they need. We know you recently visited Windblain and Asgard. Sending them to Windblain, a barely inhabited world with no useful public services, would be a huge mistake. These poor wretches would disappear into the uncharted wilds. Asgard, however, has a robust civil service and safety net that would be perfect to help them adapt to our modern culture.`
	"CN-1483" `	"This is why I asked the Vice Planetary-Governor to hold this meeting. The Deep needs you to convince these poor, backwards people that they should live on Asgard." Henrik shrugs. "For all we know, you've already decided to tell them Asgard is the best choice, in which case we're really not asking you to do anything you weren't already planning on doing. We will also help facilitate the move by providing transportation. Furthermore, for your support in this delicate matter, we will transfer 850,000 credits to your account upon their arrival in Asgard. Really, everyone wins this way."`
	"CN-1484" `	"But the Skadenga-"`
	"CN-1485" `	"I don't think-"`
	"CN-1486" `	"That's great news-"`
	"CN-1487" `	Jakob interrupts you before you have a chance to finish your sentence. "Now, listen, you just think it over. We don't need your answer now. All we need is for you to guide those people to Asgard. If you do that, the Transport Union on Valhalla will have the ships you need. If you don't, well, things might be more difficult for everyone. And remember, we'll pay you in real credits. Not charm bracelets."`
	"CN-1488" `	"Lars!" Jakob calls, and the administrator and his two guards promptly enter the room. "Show Captain <last> back to their ship. Our meeting is concluded."`
	"CN-1489" `	"Of course, sir," Lars replies.`
	"CN-1490" `	The guards grab you and "escort" you off the premises. With that distraction out of the way, it's time to go meet Hjlod at the spaceport.`
	"CN-1491" `In the crowded high-atmosphere of Asgard, it is difficult to find any reading that matches that of the exotic Setstokkr material. You do get one anomalous ping from a related material located in the urban center of Helsingor.`
	"CN-1492" `	Your ship lands in a regional spaceport that serves Helsingor, and your handheld tracker leads you to the heart of the city, where you discover a massive, winding mall. The tracker leads you inside the mall.`
	"CN-1493" `	Once inside, your eyes catch the glint of a vast metallic structure around which the entire mall is built. You can make out unusual pictures and alien letters carved into it. It appears that the shopping mall has been built around Asgard's God-Stone, and that the Stone is being used as an exotic accent wall for the myriad of shops in the structure.`
	"CN-1494" `	(Follow the tracker.)`
	"CN-1495" `	For a moment you forget the God-Stone and focus on following the tracker. It leads you to a themed restaurant on the top floor called "The Adventurer's Due." The restaurant is filled with exotic artifacts allegedly taken from all corners of known and unknown space.`
	"CN-1496" `	Your tracker homes in on one case. It contains a rune covered box, with patterns that look similar to those used by the Skadenga. The panel above it reads:`
	"CN-1497" `	'This box once contained the cure to the Rigellian Plague. It belonged to the renowned explorer, adventurer, and researcher Dr. Henry Forsyth. It was donated by the Forsyth Foundation for Academic Honesty.'`
	"CN-1498" `	Disappointed, you head back down to the lower levels of the mall and take a seat at a small in-door park at the base of God-Stone. After a moment, a woman wearing a well-pressed pantsuit approaches you.`
	"CN-1499" `	(Offer a non-committal "Hello.")`
	"CN-1500" `	(Grin and say, "Hey!")`
	"CN-1501" `	(Ignore her.)`
	"CN-1502" `	"Hello!" She gives you a professional smile. "It's a beautiful place, isn't it? Not just the mall, but the town of Helsingor itself."`
	"CN-1503" `	She sits next to you. "You might not realize it, but homes here are incredibly affordable right now. If you're looking for a new place to live, now is the time." She lowers her voice. "But you'll have to act soon. The Helsingor secret is about to get out, and once it does, prices here will skyrocket!`
	"CN-1504" `	"There are three huge prefabricated housing developments that have just completed construction on the edges of town. I could get you an appointment today if you're interested." She hands you a card. "My name is Carla Von Hausen, and I'd be happy to serve as your real-estate agent." She gives you a sharp, practiced smile that does not quite reach her eyes.`
	"CN-1505" `	"Beat it, lady."`
	"CN-1506" `	"Thanks, but I am just passing through."`
	"CN-1507" `	"My home is among the stars."`
	"CN-1508" `	A frown flickers across Carla's face for a brief second before her professional smile reasserts itself. "Trust me, why rent when you can own? Why move a large family to an empty world with poor restaurant selections when you could move them here?"`
	"CN-1509" `	She stands and smooths her suit jacket. "When you change your mind, I'll be here." With that, she's gone, and you are free to turn your attention back to the God-Stone.`
	"CN-1510" `	Carla rewards you with a condescending smile. "Ah, darling. You might work in space, but eventually, you'll need a world to call home."`
	"CN-1511" `	She stands and smooths her suit jacket. "When you are ready to make the real-estate leap, you know where to find me." Carla winks at you and then strolls off in the crowds of shoppers. Alone, you turn your attention back to the God-Stone.`
	"CN-1512" `	The parts of the God-Stone that are exposed at this level are dull and lusterless. You search for a pattern but can make nothing out due to how little of the wall is visible. It's sectioned off, with every shop and restaurant having its own piece. As you stare at it you feel nothing, just an emptiness. You do notice a plaque by a large part of unobstructed wall.`
	"CN-1513" `	(Read the plaque.)`
	"CN-1514" `	The plaque labels the God-Stone as "Colonial Graffiti" and reads:`
	"CN-1515" `	During the Colonization of The Deep in the 23rd Century, the earliest colonists erected large metal slabs and wrote pseudo-letters on them. It is believed that this was done in order to raise the prestige of their early worlds. They would claim the stones were powerful alien artifacts, or that they were made by an earlier population of humans who had arrived on the world thanks to the intercession of fairies.`
	"CN-1516" `	Either for profit, or out of a longing for home, many local communities promoted these ideas about the origins of these structures. Scientists have determined these structures were once large segments of the metal hulls of the original colony ships. To date, there has been some difficulty in identifying exactly what alloy they were constructed from.`
	"CN-1517" `	Most worlds in the Deep have "Colonial Graffiti," and they are proud reminders of our enterprising colonial origins. They are sometimes known in older texts, and by early communities, as God-Stones and Elf-Stones.`
	"CN-1518" `	Here at the Helsingor Family-Fun-Shopping-Center, we are committed to celebrating our past! This is why we, in the spirit of graffiti being the cultural touchstone of the day, have renovated this colonial structure into a central communication piece and made it a vital part of our vibrant community!`
	"CN-1519" `	You finish reading the plaque, and look at the dull gray metal wall and the inhuman things carved upon it. It looks nothing like a ship's hull.`
	"CN-1520" `	These people seem disconnected from their past. You wonder if the Skadenga could help them reconnect with it, but worry that the place would change the Skadenga more than they could change it. There is nothing more you can do here. You head back to your ship.`
	"CN-1521" `There are no signs of Hjlod when you arrive at the mostly empty spaceport. You spend a few minutes wandering around before you see her heading down the hall toward you. "Sorry to be late, you vould not believe all paper-vork they had for me. I think they aren't happy about Ice-Crawler."`
	"CN-1522" `	"That's okay. I didn't mind waiting."`
	"CN-1523" `	"I was abducted by the Vice Planetary-Governor."`
	"CN-1524" `	"That is no surprise," Hjlod says nonchalantly. "They alvays do thing like this. It matters not to us."`
	"CN-1525" `	You ask her if she's worried you've been compromised - that you might be working against the Skadenga's best interests. Hjlod shakes her head. "No. Future is set. Vhat vill, vill be. You are given task to tell us vhere to go, ve go vhere you say. The rest is just noise.`
	"CN-1526" `	"Now," Hjlod says, "Tell me about Setstokkr. Did you find it?"`
	"CN-1527" `	"I found nothing definitive."`
	"CN-1528" `	"I think I found traces of it on Windblain."`
	"CN-1529" `	"I found a strange box similar to the Setstokkr on Asgard."`
	"CN-1530" `	"Sounds like herbalist box. Ondurdis had one long before I vas born. Gave it to liar. It not important though, not Setstokkr."`
	"CN-1531" `	"Sending big piece of vood through space probably not best idea Ondurdis had." Hjlod smirks. "Still, it does not matter so much what you find. Only how you felt. You saw the vorlds. Vhere should ve go?"`
	"CN-1532" `	"Windblain."`
	"CN-1533" `	"Asgard."`
	"CN-1534" `	You answer, "There is a nearly abandoned village called Hrithfjall next to a coastal God-Stone. Something about that place felt right. I believe that is where the Skadenga should migrate."`
	"CN-1535" `	Hjlod nods. "Hrithfjall sounds like good place. I vill tell Ondurdis.`
	"CN-1536" `	You answer, "On Asgard, there is a great market built around their God-Stone, and many new homes in need of people to fill them. The people there have lost their way and they need the Skadenga to remind them of who they were."`
	"CN-1537" `	Hjlod nods. "The Skadenga have alvays been guides, pathfinders. I vill tell Ondurdis.`
	"CN-1538" `	"Vhen you were gone, thing, or assembly, vas held. Ondurdis called in all Skadenga from all villages across Nifel. You must find transportation for 2,200 folk. That is what Ondurdis told me to tell you."`
	"CN-1539" `	You frown and ask, "Did she provide money?"`
	"CN-1540" `	Hjlod shakes her head. "No. Ve could not afford it. You must go to Valhalla and convince head of Transport Union to support us." She squeezes your shoulder. "Thank you for help. For finding us new home. Ve need it. I must report now to Ondurdis. Skade be vith you." She turns and leaves.`
	"CN-1541" `Outside your ship, you are met by a representative of the Transport Union. "We have been expecting you, Captain <last>." They escort you to an elevator and up to the penthouse of the tallest building in Valhalla's capital of Himinbjorg.`
	"CN-1542" `	Three youngish men adorned in trending clothes smile as you enter. "Ah, Captain <last>, what a pleasure to finally meet you. I am Kaiden, and these are my associates Braiden and Grayden. We are executives of the Transport Union. Obviously, we were made aware you would be coming and are looking forward toward creating a lasting and beneficial relationship with you and your... clients.`
	"CN-1543" `	"We've heard that you have this inspiring idea to transport an entire backwater community from one world to another," Kaiden says.`
	"CN-1544" `	"Really inspirational," Braiden chimes in.`
	"CN-1545" `	"So inspiring," Grayden adds with an opaque hand gesture you think you've seen done by celebrities.`
	"CN-1546" `	"At the Transport Union, we say that 'it's about the people in the transports,' which is why we're humbled and excited to offer you our support in this beautiful and inspiring humanitarian adventure of yours," Kaiden finishes. Braiden and Grayden both clap enthusiastically.`
	"CN-1547" `	Kaiden waits for the ovation to subside then continues with a knowing smile. "So, tell us humble servants of the people: where to transport these poor souls?"`
	"CN-1548" `	"That's fantastic news! The Skadenga will need transport to Windblain."`
	"CN-1549" `	"They need to go to Windblain."`
	"CN-1550" `	A hush falls over the room, and both Braiden and Grayden look to Kaiden with confused expressions on their faces.`
	"CN-1551" `	"Wind. Blain." Kaiden says slowly. "Wiiiindblaaain. Are you sure that is the world these simple people wish to travel to? Maybe you got an invoice mixed up? Perhaps wrote the wrong name down?" Braiden and Grayden both silently nod.`
	"CN-1552" `	"Windblain. Yes. I am sure."`
	"CN-1553" `	"Did I stutter?"`
	"CN-1554" `	"That changes things, then." Kaiden turns to Grayden. "Are there even incentives?"`
	"CN-1555" `	Grayden is busy scanning through a tablet. "No re-urbanization kickbacks, no university-study grants, not even a housing development utilization bonus. The entire thing will probably still be a tax write off, but the Census and Culture Bureau won't be happy. Plus, obviously, no finder's fee from them."`
	"CN-1556" `	Kaiden then looks to Braiden who shakes his head. "Public Relations for people moving to... Windblain? No one who is anyone lives on Windblain, and no one else cares about those people."`
	"CN-1557" `	"Yeah, we're sorry, but this isn't going to work for us." Kaiden puts on a pained face. "This just isn't the kind of project we are willing to take on at the moment." They all stand in near unison. "In the future, try not to waste our time," Kaiden says as the three of them exit the room.`
	"CN-1558" `	Your escort reappears. "I've been instructed to inform you that there is no one else in the Deep capable of moving the amount of people you want to move. When you're ready to be practical, contact us and we'll be more than happy to help. Now, follow me out of the building." You ride the long elevator down to the lobby and are shown the door. As you leave, another employee follows you out. As he passes you, he quietly says, "Meet me in the spaceport."`
	"CN-1559" `	"That's fantastic news! The Skadenga will need transport to Asgard."`
	"CN-1560" `	"They need to go to Asgard."`
	"CN-1561" `	Kaiden beams. "Brilliant. Just brilliant. I was just telling my colleagues here about what a great place Asgard would be for this tribe. The publicity will be huge. The universities will probably want to run various studies. There will be all sorts of government programs and initiatives there to help them accept the proper Deep culture and become productive citizens like the rest of us."`
	"CN-1562" `	Grayden, Braiden and Kaiden all start shaking each others' hands and congratulating each other on being part of something so inspirational. After their celebration is over, Kaiden turns back to you. "Our transport fleet is at your disposal. They are being refitted at Mani in the Avior system."`
	"CN-1563" `	The three stand up in unison. Grayden and Braiden leave, and Kaiden turns from the door. "We are so happy you stopped by today and gave us this opportunity to really give back to the needy communities out in our neighborhood." With that, they are all gone, and your escort returns to lead you out.`
	"CN-1564" `Mani is a quiet, empty moon with only a few hubs of human activity. The Deep Security forces, Transport Union, and other semi-governmental fleets are all serviced here.`
	"CN-1565" `	A Transport Union executive meets you when you touch down. "It'll take a while for the ships to be ready, Captain <last>. We're primitive-proofing them so that those ice-savages from Nifel don't accidentally kill themselves. I'll send you a message when the ships are ready. It should take about three weeks," the executive explains as he skims through a time table displayed on his tablet.`
	"CN-1566" `	"When the ships return covered in hay, feces, and other low-tech trash, it'll take us weeks to get them in a usable state again," he mutters before promptly turning and leaving.`
	"CN-1567" `Your inbox blinks with a new message from the Transport Union:`
	"CN-1568" `	The fleet is ready for its inspirational journey. Please return to Mani.`
	"CN-1569" `				Jayden, Mani Administrator, Transport Union`
	"CN-1570" `You arrive at the spaceport to see a Union Executive overseeing the final preparations of his fleet. After a moment, the last crew members leave his side and board their ships. He walks over to you. "The fleet is ready to launch. Your mission is to escort them to Nifel, pick up as many as they can hold from there, and drop them off on Asgard. The fleet should be able to head back to Nifel and perform the rest of the resettlement trips from there, but please, try to keep all of them in one piece."`
	"CN-1571" `	"Let's get this over with."`
	"CN-1572" `	"Don't worry, your ships are in good hands."`
	"CN-1573" `	"It's time to take the Skadenga home."`
	"CN-1574" `	The ground you are standing on shakes as the ships begin to launch.`
	"CN-1575" `You have reached <planet>, but not all the Transport Union ships have arrived yet. You should take off and wait for them to catch up with you.`
	"CN-1576" `The fleet touches down just outside the over-crowded village of Udainsakr. The landscape is filled with the gathered Skadenga.`
	"CN-1577" `	The Ondurdis approaches you. "Leaving is difficult, but all winters must come to end." As her people board the ships, she adds, "I will be going on first trip to Asgard, but I must rejoin my folk. Thank you for this, and we shall speak again at our new home."`
	"CN-1578" `For the occasion of the first of the Skadenga arrivals, Helsingor has remade itself into a mad circus. There are impromptu bands playing, random, unplanned parades, teeming crowds of excited neighbors holding up signs welcoming the Skadenga into the 31st century. There is also every kind of emergency and civil personnel available here. Firemen, police, doctors, social workers; all claiming, testing, prodding, and questioning the dazed immigrants. The Ondurdis finds you in the chaos and lets you know she wishes to see the God-Stone.`
	"CN-1579" `	Together, you travel to the mall, and you explain to her how the structure was built around it, using it as an accent wall to the various posh establishments within.`
	"CN-1580" `	Upon seeing this, the old and overwhelmed matron falls to her knees in tears. "These folk are lost," she says. "We are lost."`
	"CN-1581" `	The Ondurdis looks at you with her tear-wrecked face and says, "You are instrument of Skade. I saw it. But why? Why this? Why to us?"`
	"CN-1582" `	After that, she will say no more to you. She lifts her eyes to the sky and begins to chant wildly. A few Skadenga who have made it this far join her. Various news outlets swarm around them to record the Ondurdis' breakdown.`
	"CN-1583" `	You back away slowly and bump into someone. You turn to see the real-estate agent Carla Von Hausen smiling at you. "Well done, Captain <last>. I've been authorized to tell you that my superiors have deposited 850,000 credits into your account, as was agreed upon earlier."`
	"CN-1584" `	"Your superiors!?"`
	"CN-1585" `	Carla grins. "The Census and Culture Bureau. I am one of their field agents. They are most pleased with how you handled this. Helping the Skadenga reintegrate into our culture is a big win for both the Bureau and the Skadenga.`
	"CN-1586" `	"Anyways, I just wanted to pass that on. I have lots of work to do, thanks to you." She winks and wanders into the crowd.`
	"CN-1587" `	You return to your ship to count your money as you hear the Transport Union ships engage their engines to pick up another load of the Skadenga.`
	"CN-1588" `There is a new message in your inbox from Hjlod, one of the Skadenga you helped relocate to <planet>.`
	"CN-1589" `	"<first>, we need your help. Come to <planet>, and have space for 52 souls."`
	"CN-1590" `The Asgard spaceport hums with a thousand indecipherable conversations. It is a landscape overburdened with kinetic humanity. You spend hours wandering through the crowds for a glimpse of Hjlod. Exhausted, you are ready to throw in the towel when you feel a strong hand grab your arm. You turn to see a familiar tattooed face. Her eyes are dark and dull, her hair thin and unkept, her face creased with unhappiness.`
	"CN-1591" `	"Not a vord." Hjlod says as you walk toward a portion of the spaceport that is marked "Closed - Under Construction." She draws you along. It's strange to see her so changed over such a short period of time. It's only been a year since you brought her here.`
	"CN-1592" `	She ushers you past various barriers meant to keep a compliant public out. Finally, she leads you into a long hallway filled with the detritus of life: empty food containers, dirty blankets, other less savory items. People are also here - dirty, clumped together, wretched-looking.`
	"CN-1593" `	Hjlod turns back to you. "It safe to talk novhere. But ve must, so here must do."`
	"CN-1594" `	"What do you want from me?"`
	"CN-1595" `	"Who are these people?"`
	"CN-1596" `	Hjlod glares at you. "From you? Everything. For that is vhat you took from us.`
	"CN-1597" `	"I do not know vhy you did it. Vhy you brought us here. If Skade really let us down. Or if you ignored her," she growls. "But it does not matter. All that matters is that ve leave, and that is vhy ve need you."`
	"CN-1598" `	Hjlod laughs and tears run down her cheeks. "Do you not recognize us? Our great savior? Ve are the Skadenga, and this is your handivwork."`
	"CN-1599" `	She looks away from you and continues. "The rest are not dead, no. But they have left us. Most are happy; happy to be fed, happy to be entertained, happy to forget who they are, happy to be Skadenga in name, but not in practice. But those here cannot accept that. Ve refuse to become them.`
	"CN-1600" `	"Ve hide now. From the social workers, from the service providers, from the government. They can still find us, they know ve are here, but vhat they don't know is that ve can leave. That you can take us avay from here."`
	"CN-1601" `	Hjlod takes a deep, calming breath. "I call because you are our only hope. They vill not let us leave. They vill not let us be. They vill steal our souls." She points a shaky finger at you. "Take us back to Nifel. All those who are left. Take us home. Ve know the cold vill get us eventually. But better to live on a dying vorld as Skadenga than to live here as nothing."`
	"CN-1602" `	"I will help you."`
	"CN-1603" `	"I need to think about it."`
	"CN-1604" `	Hjlod grimaces. "Once they know you are here, they vill collect us. Come back here in an hour. Any longer than that, and ve vill be gone." She slumps down on the ground as you exit the dark, dirty tunnel where the remaining Skadenga cling to their fleeting identity.`
	"CN-1605" `	Alone, you have a decision to make. You can return to help them escape this world. Or you can find Clara Von Hausen, the Census and Culture Bureau undercover agent, and report to her what is going on. She would probably pay you well for the information.`
	"CN-1606" `	(Return to Hjlod and help the Skadenga.)`
	"CN-1607" `	(Find Carla.)`
	"CN-1608" `	You leave Hjlod and her gang of stubborn savages behind, and return to the active parts of the thrumming spaceport. Carla's contact information, as an alleged real estate agent, is easy to find, and in a few minutes you have her on call. "Captain <last>, it is a pleasure to hear from you again. What-so-ever can I help you with?" she says with believable cheerfulness.`
	"CN-1609" `	You tell her about the Skadenga hiding in the spaceport and their plans to escape to Nifel.`
	"CN-1610" `	"Oh dear!" Carla says. "How terrible. Those poor, foolish simpletons would surely suffer on that terrible frozen world. How misguided of them. We are aware that some have struggled to assimilate. It's quite tragic, but we will handle things from here. Hopefully, we can convince them to integrate eventually. It really is for the best. I wish their old leader could have seen that before she died. It would have been easier for everyone.`
	"CN-1611" `	"As always, we appreciate your valuable contributions. I'll authorize a generous sum of credits to be transferred to your account. I need to get some approvals so it may take a couple of days to come through. Thank you, and buh-bye!"`
	"CN-1612" `	You return to Hjlod, who is surprised that you came back at all, and let her know that you going to help them.`
	"CN-1613" `	Hearing this, the slumped and depressed dredges in the hall stir and rise from their stupor. Hurriedly, some gather items while others race off further into the dark, unused parts of the spaceport.`
	"CN-1614" `	"Ve have 52 people that need off this vorld right now." Hjlod hesitates a moment, and then adds, "I know how much you like money. Ve have pooled all our savings together and vill pay you <payment> for this job." She grabs a ragged duffle bag and a group gather around her. "The rest vill meet us at your ship. Ve move now."`
	"CN-1615" `	(Follow Hjlod.)`
	"CN-1616" `	Once you're back in the operational spaceport, you and your group move quickly, while drawing occasional glances from curious on-lookers. A large group of disheveled Skaldenga are waiting for you when you reach your ship. "Everyone on, quickly!" Hjlod barks at her people.`
	"CN-1617" `	A few moments later, they are all on board. "Asdis, headcount!" Hjlod orders. As you're waiting, two more dirty and gaunt Skadenga show up. Asdis adds them to her count and then addresses Hjlod. "Ondurdis, 48 total."`
	"CN-1618" `	Hjlod frowns. "It's Arnson's family isn't it? I told him he vas too far."`
	"CN-1619" `	A commotion boils up from a few terminals down, and you see some civil servants and local police officers heading your way. Asdis is also watching. "They could still be coming."`
	"CN-1620" `	"It's too late for them." Hjlod shuts the hatch. "<first>, if ever ve vere friends. Take off, now."`
	"CN-1621" `	(Take off.)`
	"CN-1622" `	(Power down the ship and open the hatch.)`
	"CN-1623" `	You turn off your ship's ignition, pop open the hatch before Hjlod can react, and jump out. Carla Von Hausen, at least two civil service workers, and a squad of police officers arrive within seconds. Carla gives you a tight smile. "Decided to do the right thing in the end? We appreciate it."`
	"CN-1624" `	The police officers enter your ship and start restraining and removing the Skadenga aboard it.`
	"CN-1625" `	"As always, we appreciate your help and value our continued working relationship. Expect a payment for your aid in the next couple days, after I've gotten it approved." Carla steps back to assess the Skadenga, most of which are sullen and reserved. One, however, is screaming, kicking, and biting.`
	"CN-1626" `	The unruly Skadenga is dragged past you, and spit splashes against your cheek. "I'll kill you, <first>. If ever ve meet again I'll kill you. You've killed me. You've killed me." Hjlod's red and tear-stained face recedes as officers drag her away.`
	"CN-1627" `	"Misguided girl," Carla says sadly. "We'll take it from here. Have a wonderful day, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-1628" `	You punch it, and your ship burns for the stars. Hjlod visibly relaxes when the thrust kicks in. She closes her tired eyes and slumps to the floor. "Thank Skade," is all she says.`
	"CN-1629" `Your ship touches down just outside the abandoned village of Udainskar. Silently, your passengers disembark and drift into the world they once knew and thought never to see again. The village appears to have weathered its abandonment well, and it appears the people here will not have too much trouble picking up where they left off.`
	"CN-1630" `	Hjlod lingers besides your ship for just a moment. "The credits are in hard-drive on your ship's console. I hope it makes you happy.`
	"CN-1631" `	"I do not know vhy you sent us to that place. But I am happy to be home. So go, and maybe one day I vill not hate to see you again."`
	"CN-1632" `You receive a message from your bank that <payment> have been deposited into your account from the Census and Culture Bureau of The Deep. The following memo is attached:`
	"CN-1633" `	"For heroic and selfless service to the ideals and prosperity of The Deep."`
	"CN-1634" `A familiar woman is waiting for you outside your ship. Although it's been more than seven years since you've last seen her, you recognize Hjlod instantly. Her eyes are brighter than when last you parted, and she has the same lopsided grin that you remember. "<first>, I saw your ship landing, and thought I vould say hello."`
	"CN-1635" `	You ask her how she has been, and she tells you that the small community of Skadenga have rebuilt and thrived here. That there has even been a small amount of immigration to their tiny town. That word had gotten out about their desperate escape from Asgard.`
	"CN-1636" `	She tells you that she forgives your past actions, and hopes you find whatever it is you are looking for among the stars. She even hugs you before she leaves.`
	"CN-1637" `You receive a message from the Census and Culture Bureau of the Deep. The Deep Citizen known as Hjlod has died. The cause of death appeared to be related to heavy substance abuse. The Bureau has determined that you are her closest relation and has forwarded you her entire inheritance: <payment>.`
	"CN-1638" `The Transport Union employee is waiting for you near the entrance. He's wearing a wide-brimmed hat, a bulky scarf, a long coat with an up-turned collar, and sunglasses. You worry his over-the-top efforts to look nondescript will only draw more attention.`
	"CN-1639" `	"Can't speak long," he says. "It's too dangerous. I can't afford to be seen with you."`
	"CN-1640" `	You ask him what this is all about.`
	"CN-1641" `	"I don't agree with what the Union or the Deep are doing. I was raised in a small town where we still respected our past, and I couldn't just sit around and do nothing. So listen: with the Union against you, there's no transport company that will pick up your contract, with one exception. There's a bold renegade mineral baron on <planet>. He hates the Union, and may be willing to do what you ask."`
	"CN-1642" `	"How do I find him?"`
	"CN-1643" `	The Union employee begins moving away from you. "Name's Hroar. You can usually find him in the Red Rock Saloon, inside the Muspel Spaceport."`
	"CN-1644" `	The disgruntled Union employee then says, quite loudly, "I do not know where the bracelet shop is, please stop asking me!" and hurries away from you.`
	"CN-1645" `You've arrived at the rusty-hued world that is Muspel. You should head into the spaceport to see if you can find Hroar.`
	"CN-1646" `The floor of the spaceport is covered in the dirty red dust of hundreds of shuffling feet. Prospectors, miners, drillers, and all their attendant associates are intermixed here, gossiping about the latest finds, accidents, and hauls. Every person, either saturated in red earth or immaculately clean, creates a visual aid to boundaries of class, paycheck, and leadership.`
	"CN-1647" `	The Red Rock Saloon is located deep in the trade-craft section of the spaceport, far enough from the tourist areas to discourage anyone but the locals and those with business to enter.`
	"CN-1648" `	(Enter the Red Rock Saloon.)`
	"CN-1649" `	The doors swing open, revealing a dimly lit room filled with rough unsavory people. Piano music is playing on a cheap speaker, and the eyes of the patrons slide to get a good look at you without turning their heads. There is an expectant pause. You get the feeling they are waiting for you to either announce something or leave.`
	"CN-1650" `	"I'm looking for Hroar."`
	"CN-1651" `	For a moment nothing happens, and then a gruff voice spirals out from a dark corner. "Back here."`
	"CN-1652" `	You walk to the back of the saloon and find a gruff man in a long reddish-brown jacket seated with his back against the wall, and a bottle of whiskey on his otherwise empty table. "Have a seat," he says.`
	"CN-1653" `	After you sit, he places a gun on the table. "So the Allen boys think they can send some greenhorn killer to take me out?" Hroar barks a laugh. "Not likely." With his free hand, he takes a swig of his whiskey. "Here's what's going to happen. I am not going to kill you. Only maim you, a bit. And you tell the Allen boys that the next person they send will come back even worse. We had a deal, and I expect them to keep it."`
	"CN-1654" `	"You got the wrong person. I don't even know who the Allen boys are."`
	"CN-1655" `	"I was not sent by the Allen whoevers, and if you even touch me, I will burn this entire planet to ash."`
	"CN-1656" `	Hroar breaks into uproarious laughter. People sitting the booth over, who were obviously listening, also start laughing. "Don't make threats you can't back up. Or you're gonna be a messenger in a bodybag.`
	"CN-1657" `	"If it wasn't the Allen boys who sent you, who do you work for? The Leshinskis? Mad Mikkel's Gang? Or maybe the Hanovarian?" Hroar pauses. "Nah, not his style. So who?"`
	"CN-1658" `	Hesitation flickers on Hroar's face, and he lifts his hand away from his gun. "No need to be making threats like that. We're all friends here."`
	"CN-1659" `	His expression shifts as he changes the subject. "I doubt the Allen boys could afford someone like you, so why exactly are you here?"`
	"CN-1660" `	(Explain the situation.)`
	"CN-1661" `	After you finish your explanation, Hroar frowns. "This is some kind of pickle you've gotten yourself into. And humanitarian or not, I ain't a man who is known for working for free. But what you heard is correct: if you need people moved and the Union won't do it, I'm your best bet in the Deep.`
	"CN-1662" `	"It would be something to give the Union a black eye like this. And I would generate some good will - I could probably even recoup most the costs in tax-write offs and government grants. But still..." He drifts off, then looks at you hard for a moment. "Tell you what. I'll do it, for free, if you promise to owe me a favor in the future. A favor for a favor. What'dya say?"`
	"CN-1663" `	"Deal."`
	"CN-1664" `	"What kind of favor?"`
	"CN-1665" `	"No deal."`
	"CN-1666" `	"Oh, I don't know. Something always needs doin' around here. I went from rags to riches, you know, and a journey like that leaves lots of disgruntled folk in your wake. Plus business at times requires a certain sort of captain. Whatever it will be, I'll have you know I run a legitimate - well, mostly legitimate - organization, and you won't be asked to do anything too illegal."`
	"CN-1667" `	He grins. "So, what do you say? Deal?"`
	"CN-1668" `	Hroar leans back. "Friend, listen up. If the Union won't do it, and I won't do it, then no one will. You'll either have to get those 2,200 bunks yourself, or it just ain't happenin'. I promise I won't ask anything of you too illegal. So, you sure you want to say no?"`
	"CN-1669" `	"I'm in. Deal."`
	"CN-1670" `	"I'm out. No deal."`
	"CN-1671" `	Hroar smirks. "Alright. You're out. Get outta my booth, and good luck on your little charity adventure." Hroar goes back to drinking his whiskey as the saloon's swinging door hits you on your way out.`
	"CN-1672" `	"Good. Good. People making deals. That's what society is all about, ya know? Alright, listen up: it'll take me about two weeks to get my fleet ready to transport your friends. Will take a good handful of trips too, but you only need to guide us for the first one. So, come back here then and we'll get this show on the road."`
	"CN-1673" `Your inbox blinks with a new message from Hroar on <planet>.`
	"CN-1674" `	Everything is ready. Get back here.`
	"CN-1675" `				Hroar`
	"CN-1676" `			CEO of Hardy Hroar's Haulers`
	"CN-1677" `			We're an unstoppable force that has never met an immovable object!`
	"CN-1678" `The <origin> spaceport is filled with crews doing final checks on their various haulers. You find Hroar near a cluster of captains.`
	"CN-1679" `	"<first>!" Hroar calls out as you near. "Glad you got here in time! Word is the Union boys are furious about this. Undermines their authority and what not; it's great." He claps you on your back. "My captains are ready. How about we get this rodeo started?"`
	"CN-1680" `	"Yee-haw!"`
	"CN-1681" `	"It's about time."`
	"CN-1682" `	Launch sirens blare as the crews all load up in their ships and the fleet takes off!`
	"CN-1683" `You have reached <planet>, but the Hardy Hroar's Hauler ships have not all arrived yet. You should take off and wait for them to catch up with you.`
	"CN-1684" `The reserved and limited government of Windblain pays neither you nor your fleet any heed as you make your way down to the outskirts of Hrithfjall. An empty, windswept landscape beneath gray clouds and a small group of weathered fishermen are waiting for you outside your ship.`
	"CN-1685" `	"I thought I'd be seeing you again," Aldfrith says at the front of his small delegation. "I dreamt that ice rained down upon the seas, and that Ran was glad of it." The creases in his face bunch up as he smiles at the memory, and then his eyes wander to the disembarking Skadenga. A moment later, the Ondurdis joins you.`
	"CN-1686" `	"So, you are the ice that falls from the stars?" asks Aldfrith with a hint of mirth in his eyes.`
	"CN-1687" `	"We are Skadenga, daughters of Skade. Mistresses of ice, mountain, and cold. But, I think now, she sends us to her sister Ran." The Ondurdis replies.`
	"CN-1688" `	Aldfrith nods slowly. "We are the folk of Ran; the offspring of the surf, the students of the wind, and the watchers of the storm. We welcome you and your people here. Though there are few here at present, many more of our number can be found out amongst the surging seas." He glances at the growing number of Skadenga. "If you follow me, I will escort you to our village and show you what buildings you may use. Though I fear we can not house so many."`
	"CN-1689" `	The Ondurdis smiles. "We thank you for your hospitality. It is good to find others who remember the old ways. Fear not, though; we are resourceful lot." Turning to you, she continues, "Meet me near the ships at makeshift spaceport in a few hours. I have much to do at moment." She and many others then follow Aldfrith and his group to the halls of Hrithfjall.`
	"CN-1690" `	As you watch them leave, you hear the sound of Hroar's fleet taking off and heading back to Nifel to pick up the rest of the Skadenga.`
	"CN-1691" `The fleet touches down just outside the crowded village of Udainsakr. The landscape is filled with the gathered Skadenga.`
	"CN-1692" `	The Ondurdis approaches you. "Leaving is difficult, but all winters must come to end." She watches as her people climb aboard the fleet. "I will be taking first trip to Windblain, but I must rejoin my folk. Thank you for this, and we shall speak again at our new home."`
	"CN-1693" `	She leaves you with a warm smile in the wintry village.`
	"CN-1694" `Your fleet touches down just outside of the crowded village of Udainsakr. The landscape is filled with the gathered Skadenga.`
	"CN-1695" `	The Ondurdis approaches you. "Leaving is difficult, but all winters must come to end." She looks curiously at your fleet. "This I did not expect. These are not Transport Union. These are yours? You brought your own fleet to help us?"`
	"CN-1696" `	You smile and shrug, letting her know that sometimes you just have to do things yourself. She shakes her head. "You are full of surprises, <first>. Perhaps I'll surprise you someday as well."`
	"CN-1697" `	Her eyes wander to her people who are busy embarking. "I must rejoin my folk. But thank you for this, and we shall speak again at our new home." The Ondurdis leaves you with a warm smile in the wintry village.`
	"CN-1698" `You have reached <planet>, but your ships have not all arrived yet. You should take off and wait for them to catch up with you.`
	"CN-1699" `The Ondurdis bows to you when you arrive. "You have chosen good home for us."`
	"CN-1700" `	She has a small, wooden box with inlaid runes that looks very similar to the one you saw at Asgard. She opens the box to reveal a blue glowing stone with a single rune inscribed on it. "We call these Tears of Skade. We found few of them buried around Goddess-Stone of Nifel. They are always cold, and may be useful in warm ship." She hands you the box.`
	"CN-1701" `	"You honor me. Thank you."`
	"CN-1702" `	"A glowing stone? After all I did? Where's the money?"`
	"CN-1703" `	The Ondurdis shakes her head sadly. "I have given you something more valuable than any amount of money. Yet, you spurn it. There is value here, in this happy community, in our story, that is worth more than credits. Take this sacred stone, for you have earned it, and in time I hope you learn what I have failed to teach."`
	"CN-1704" `	She leaves you to her happy community and new home, with the strange stone and a lonely silence of your own making.`
	"CN-1705" `	"No, it is you who honor us. We will not forget this. Now, I told you when we met I would answer question. What would you like to know?"`
	"CN-1706" `	"How old are you?"`
	"CN-1707" `	"Who were the elves?"`
	"CN-1708" `	"Why were the Skadenga making amends?"`
	"CN-1709" `	"This Tear of Skade, I've seen something like it before. Might you know more about these enigmatic stones?"`
	"CN-1710" `	"No. I am done here."`
	"CN-1711" `	The Ondurdis' eyes sparkle mischievously. "Too old. Suffice to say, my name is Eymani, and I was Pathfinder who discovered cure to Rigellian plague. As to how I am so old, or all that I have seen: I cannot say more, for it is not my story to tell."`
	"CN-1712" `	"Elves is broad term. Many creatures over long ages have been called elves. But, here, in Deep, I believe there are two kinds. First, there are alfar, known by many. They were ones who transported us here from Earth. I do not know why they did this, but I do know that it was not out of kindness. They are devious, and they are opaque."`
	"CN-1713" `	The Ondurdis lowers her voice and leans in. "But there is another kind of elf here. The Hudulfolk, the Hidden. They served makers of God-Stones. They are rare, and mostly dormant. I do not think even alfar are aware of them. They cannot be trusted, for no alien can be, but are not devious. Each Hidden is different, but all are connected to natural world. When Skadenga were new upon Nifel, we had some small dealing with them before they returned to sleep of eons."`
	"CN-1714" `	The Ondurdis nods slowly. "On Earth, before alfar, or elves, came to us, we had forsaken Skade. Men of Book had persuaded us to abandon old ways and embrace their new religion. We deserted our temples, forsook our trees, and thought ourselves the better for it."`
	"CN-1715" `	Her old face scrunches up in anger at the memory. "When we were brought to Deep, when we saw Goddess-Stone, we realized our folly. We would atone, and we would be strong." She looks up at you, her eyes bright and her face firm. "And strong we have been."`
	"CN-1716" `	"Less than I would like," she says softly. "Longer I live, more I learn how little I know. Before ships came, when we knew only ways of stone, there was different kind of power here. Fragile, gentle, stone-magic. Then came endless colonists, men from stars with ships that sailed night. Stone-magic failed and secret ways shut."`
	"CN-1717" `	She looks at you sadly. "These stones are relics from lost age. Stolen age." She pauses. "More I cannot tell, but if you bring me such stone I will look for you, and see if more I might know."`
	"CN-1718" `	"That is enough whispering of old secrets." She straightens up and smooths her dress. "I have much to do, and I imagine so do you. Take care, <first>. May Skade protect you." The leader of the Skadenga returns to her people on the windswept hills of the small, picturesque town of Hrithfjall.`
	"CN-1719" `	With the conversation concluded, you wander back toward your ship as the sun sets. You hear the hustle and bustle all around you of eager people pursuing a new and exciting life. The promise of a new beginning is almost as intoxicating as the faint hint of sea-salt on the cool breeze that ruffles your clothes.`
	"CN-1720" `	You wonder if you're forgetting anything - if you should find Hjlod and speak with her. But she is nowhere in sight, and you realize there will be time to see her again. You climb aboard your ship and leave these people to their new home, and you wonder: in all the bright stars and warm worlds, where might your home be?`
	"CN-1721" `The familiar sight of <origin> brings up old memories. It's been more than a year since you helped the Skadenga settle <origin>, and you wonder if you should check in on them.`
	"CN-1722" `	(Visit Hrithfjall.)`
	"CN-1723" `	(Don't visit Hrithfjall.)`
	"CN-1724" `	It's a short journey to the outskirts of Hrithfjall. You are evidently spotted from afar, as someone is waiting for you.`
	"CN-1725" `	Hjlod's lopsided smile is warm and refreshing. "<first>!" She says with genuine joy. "You did not say goodbye! How can I forgive?" You hug her. You walk together along the shore toward Hrithfjall. She tells you all about the growing village - how the Skadenga are thriving here, and how they've gotten along with the Ranfolk.`
	"CN-1726" `	She points to a small wooden craft up ahead. "I built her," she says with pride. "No more Ice-Crawler for Hjlod. I am sailor now. I take curious tourist out now and again. Much safer than Ice-Crawler, except when we capsize." She shrugs and grins. "Perhaps someday you'll be my tourist again. This time, I promise no accidents. Also, there are no Ice-Slugs to worry about." She pauses for a moment. "There are Shark-Kraken though. But don't worry. Hjlod vill take care of you."`
	"CN-1727" `	You spend the afternoon in Hrithfjall, where you are treated like a guest of honor. The Ondurdis seems younger than you remember, and also appears quite fond of old Aldfrith. You eat strange fish, listen to unlikely stories, and laugh at outrageous jokes.`
	"CN-1728" `	As the sun sinks in the sky, you announce that you should be heading back. "Wait," the Ondurdis says. "I have task for you. If you are interested."`
	"CN-1729" `	"Sure; I'd do anything for you guys."`
	"CN-1730" `	"Hard pass."`
	"CN-1731" `	You explain you've already done enough for them and are needed elsewhere. They graciously accept your excuses, and you leave back to your ship.`
	"CN-1732" `	The Ondurdis smiles. "I knew you would accept.`
	"CN-1733" `	"We have folk here who have died over last year. Mostly old, a few in accidents, nothing out of ordinary. But each Skadenga carries with them life-stone, upon which they carve their memories. When Skadenga dies, these stones must be returned to their Family-Cairns by their nearest relative or closest friend. But, all our Family-Cairns are on <planet>."`
	"CN-1734" `	She then nods at you. "If you could transport family members of deceased to return their stones, it would mean much to everyone here. We would pay you <payment>."`
	"CN-1735" `	"I'll do it for free."`
	"CN-1736" `	You explain to them you have more pressing matters to attend to and cannot be a taxi service for their grieving. They graciously accept your excuses, and you leave back to your ship.`
	"CN-1737" `	The Ondurdis shakes her head. "You have already done too much for us for too little pay. We can afford to pay you, and we will."`
	"CN-1738" `	"The five Stone-Bearers will accompany you back to your ship. They will pay you <payment> for transport to <planet>. May Skade and Ran watch over your journey." The Ondurdis turns this into a toast, which everyone gladly participates in.`
	"CN-1739" `	Hjlod walks with you and your passengers back to your ship. "Be well, <first>."`
	"CN-1740" `The abandoned village of Udainsakr is cold, dark, and half-buried in unrelenting snow. Everything feels colder than you remember, and you wonder how long before this planet is a perpetual snowball.`
	"CN-1741" `	The five Skadenga you brought are polite and circumspect. Upon landing, they hand you <payment>, leave your ship and head for the Goddess-Stone of Skade with its attendant piles of stones. They each navigate their way to a specific cairn, stand there for a moment, speaking or chanting, and then place their stone upon it. Solemnly, they return to you with their task complete. There is nothing else for them to do here, and they request you take them home.`
	"CN-1742" `The Skadenga are gladdened to be home. Something about being on <planet> lifts their spirits, and they thank you for your help.`
	"CN-1743" `A group of eight Skadenga approach you. They ask if you'd be willing to take them to <stopovers> so that they can return their loved-one's stones to their Family-Cairns, offering <payment> for their transportation.`
	"CN-1744" `The eight Skadenga solmenly make their way off your ship and into the icy lands of Nifel. After a few hours they return, cold, and eager to return home to Windblain.`
	"CN-1745" `The Skadenga are happy to be home. The churning seas of <planet> lift their spirits, and they head out into the sea-sweet air after paying you <payment>.`
	"CN-1746" `You're surprised to see the Ondurdis walking toward you.`
	"CN-1747" `	She nods politely before speaking. "<first>, I just wanted to thank you for ferrying our Stone-Bearers to Nifel and back. I have added this task to the job board so you can more easily assist in the future. I've also let them know they need enough money to pay for a return trip." The Ondurdis touches your shoulder, and then walks away.`
	"CN-1748" `The mourners take their small stones and head off to visit the cairns of their ancestors. After some time they return to your ship, happy to see the frozen-wastes of Nifel left behind.`
	"CN-1749" `The Skadenga hand you <payment> as they disembark and return to their lives on Windblain.`
	"CN-1750" `Your inbox hums with a new message from <planet>:`
	"CN-1751" `Dear <first>,`
	"CN-1752" `	I never properly thanked you for saving my life on Nifel all those years ago. If you're ever in the neighborhood, please stop by <planet>.`
	"CN-1753" `				Signed, Hjlod`
	"CN-1754" `Hjlod is waiting for you when you land. She looks healthy, strong, and happy - less gaunt and stressed then you recall her looking on Nifel when you first met. She gives you a hug. "Alvays good to see you, <first>. I have been thinking, vith all that vent on and needed to be done, I never had chance to thank you for saving me from cold."`
	"CN-1755" `	She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a small pouch. "I have stone that has long been in my family. I wish to give it to you. Keep you cold in hot ship, remind you of Hjlod in far-off galaxy."`
	"CN-1756" `	Hjlod gives you a glowing blue Tear of Skade, just like the one The Ondurdis gave you sometime before.`
	"CN-1757" `	"How many of these are there?" you ask.`
	"CN-1758" `	"Only few," she answers. "They were found around the Goddess-Stone in the early days. Passed from Skadenga mother to Skadenga daughter. I have no daughter, but I have you, so this is now yours."`
	"CN-1759" `	You thank her and spend the rest of the day with her, talking, laughing and walking upon the friendly earth of <planet>.`
	"CN-1760" `Your inbox hums with a new message from Nifel.`
	"CN-1761" `	I never properly thanked you for saving my life all those years ago. If you're ever in the neighborhood, please stop by <planet>.`
	"CN-1762" `Nifel is colder than you remember. The snow is deeper, and the ice harder. Despite this, the small recolonized settlement of Udainsakr appears to be thriving. Although it started with less than 50 Skadenga, thanks to the steady flow of pilgrims, the village population now numbers over a thousand.`
	"CN-1763" `	Hjlod finds you and gives you a small smile. "I am glad you came."`
	"CN-1764" `	She reaches into her pocket and pulls out a small wooden box, similar to the one you saw displayed at Asgard years ago. "I have been thinking," Hjlod says. "Maybe all this vas vill of Skade. Maybe you took us to Asgard to make us stronger, to make us better. It is bitter lesson, but I understand it now."`
	"CN-1765" `	She holds out the box. "This is Tear of Skade. Only few ever found, and this I give to you. For saving my life, for bringing us back here, for making us stronger."`
	"CN-1766" `	The box opens, displaying a small, blue glowing rock. "Alvays makes cold. Alvays. Useful on hot ship. Keep this vith you, and know Skadenga vith you too," Hjlod says, handing it to you.`
	"CN-1767" `	Her eyes water, and she wipes them. "Your story is forever chiseled on our stones."`
	"CN-1768" `	She turns and leaves you there, holding a Tear of Skade, and shivering in Nifel's unforgiving cold.`
	"CN-1769" `As you wander through the spaceport, something catches your eye at a kiosk selling gifts, trinkets, and other odds and ends.`
	"CN-1770" `	There's an old-style book there, bound up in an ice-blue cover, titled: "The Skadenga Saga: Against All Odds, by Hjlod Hrimnirsdottir."`
	"CN-1771" `	(Ignore the book and move on.)`
	"CN-1772" `	(Pick the book up.)`
	"CN-1773" `	The book feels solid in your hands, and you scan through it. There are chapters about near death survival on Nifel, the subtle hostility of Asgard, the sudden death of the old Ondurdis, who you learn was named Eymani, and the triumph of Hjlod and the survivors on Nifel.`
	"CN-1774" `	The book feels solid in your hands, and you scan through it. There are chapters about near death survival on Nifel, corrupt Deep officials, the colorful haulers on Muspel, and the ultimate triumph on Windblain.`
	"CN-1775" `	The book feels solid in your hands, and you scan through it. There are chapters about near death survival on Nifel, corrupt Deep officials, and the ultimate triumph on Windblain.`
	"CN-1776" `	You place the book back on its stand as the attendant notices you. "It's pretty popular, that one. I hear it started this whole 'back-to-nature' primalism cult." He shrugs. "Whatever sells, ya know. Anyways, you buying?"`
	"CN-1777" `	You decline. You already know that story.`
	"CN-1778" `	You keep walking. You already know that story.`
	"CN-1779" `You can't help noticing that the freighter parked next to the <ship> is in very bad shape, its hull pockmarked with blaster scars, as well as larger dents that may be from missiles. The crew and a number of men in militia uniforms are busy welding new hull plating onto it; the captain is having an animated conversation with a young female militia officer.`
	"CN-1780" `	(Approach them and find out what happened.)`
	"CN-1781" `	You overhear enough of the conversation to figure out that the freighter was attacked by pirates, and the militia are helping to get it in working condition again. "A little spit shine and it'll look as good as new," the officer says, but the captain of the ship doesn't look convinced and walks up to his ship to work on it alongside the crew.`
	"CN-1782" `	The militia officer glances over her shoulder and, having spotted you listening in, waves you over. "No need to be shy," she says. "I'm guessing you're not from around here."`
	"CN-1783" `	"How can you tell?"`
	"CN-1784" `	"Are the pirates rough around these parts?"`
	"CN-1785" `	"Because captains from around here don't rubberneck at an every-day occurrence. After seeing your first dozen or so damaged ships, you eventually get used to seeing them and just move on."`
	"CN-1786" `	"Are the pirates rough around these parts?" you ask.`
	"CN-1787" `	"Rougher than you're probably used to if you're from farther up north. The Navy doesn't patrol these parts, not unless there's some high profile warlord that's on their radar. Because of that, pirates have more free rein to terrorize us down here." She pauses for a moment while turning back to the freighter. "And the pirate fleets keep getting stronger every year," she says with concern.`
	"CN-1788" `	"Is there something I can do to help?"`
	"CN-1789" `	"I wish I could help, but my ship is not a warship."`
	"CN-1790" `	"There is indeed," she says. "Have you heard of the Southern Mutual Defense Pact?"`
	"CN-1791" `	"There are other ways you could help us," she says. "Have you heard of the Southern Mutual Defense Pact?"`
	"CN-1792" `	"No. What is it?"`
	"CN-1793" `	She says, "We're a collection of worlds that have decided that since the Navy doesn't patrol this part of the galaxy anymore, it's up to us to keep the pirates in check. The idea is that if the pirates ever try something big, like capturing an entire planet, that planet can call on the entire Pact to assist them. And, as you can see, we also do our fair share of helping out the local merchants where we can."`
	"CN-1794" `	"Sounds like a good idea," you say.`
	"CN-1795" `	"The Pact is launching a new initiative, led by myself," she says. "We're calling it the 'Thousand Eyes.' We're asking merchant ship captains to let us access their scanner logs, basically using merchants as a surveillance network. You don't have to fight the pirates, just let us know if you see them. Interested?"`
	"CN-1796" `	"Sure, I would be glad to help."`
	"CN-1797" `	"Sorry, sounds too risky."`
	"CN-1798" `	"Great!" she says. "Right now, we need more eyes on a few systems on the edge of Southern space. All you need to do is fly through those systems, then report to our base on <destination>. I'll mark the target systems on your ship's map for you. And by the way, the name's Freya Winters."`
	"CN-1799" `	"<first> <last>," you respond, shaking her hand.`
	"CN-1800" `	"Nice to meet you, Captain <last>. Glad to have another helping hand. I'll be heading to <planet> after I've finished my business on <origin>, so see you there."`
	"CN-1801" `As you complete the usual landing documents with the Navy inspector outside your ship, another officer, a middle-aged man in the same uniform, walks up from behind him. As he passes by he gives a curt nod to the inspector, who suddenly walks away swiftly without saying anything, not even a "good day" to you or this new officer. He must have some sort of seniority over the inspector.`
	"CN-1802" `	Once the inspector is out of the way, the new officer turns to you and says, "Excuse me, Captain <last>. I would like to speak with you for a few minutes."`
	"CN-1803" `	"Okay."`
	"CN-1804" `	"Sorry, I'm really busy right now."`
	"CN-1805" `	"Unfortunately, this cannot wait," he responds.`
	"CN-1806" `	"Am I correct that you have been assisting the Southern Mutual Defense Pact?"`
	"CN-1807" `	"Am I correct that you performed some missions for the Southern Mutual Defense Pact, back before they became the Free Worlds?"`
	"CN-1808" `	His voice is very friendly, and he is not armed or accompanied by any other officers that you can see, so it doesn't seem like you are in trouble or in danger of being arrested - especially since your work for the Pact was perfectly legal.`
	"CN-1809" `	"I don't know what you are talking about."`
	"CN-1810" `	"I did take a few jobs helping out the local militias, yes."`
	"CN-1811" `	"Yes, I ran several missions for the Pact."`
	"CN-1812" `	"I'm sorry, but I don't want to talk to you about that."`
	"CN-1813" `	He has been looking intently into your eye, and when you lie to him, he frowns. "It really isn't necessary to lie to me," he says. You are not sure what to say in response, so you remain quiet.`
	"CN-1814" `	"Tell me," he says, "was there one particular militia officer who you reported to, or was it someone different every time?" As he is speaking, you look for clues of who he is or why he is questioning you, and you notice something very odd. The Navy inspector before, and all Navy personnel you have encountered in the past, had a name badge on their lapel and rank insignia on their collar. But this officer's uniform is entirely blank.`
	"CN-1815" `	"I don't remember anyone's name in particular."`
	"CN-1816" `	"I would rather not name any names."`
	"CN-1817" `	"I usually reported to an officer named Freya Winters."`
	"CN-1818" `	"I don't want to talk about this. I'm leaving."`
	"CN-1819" `	"Oh well," he says, "it was worth asking. Would you at least be willing to tell me the nature of the missions you were performing?"`
	"CN-1820" `	"Ah yes, Miss Winters," he says. "A very capable woman, although she's more skilled as an engineer than as a leader. Can you tell me what sort of work you were performing for her?"`
	"CN-1821" `	"I'd rather not say."`
	"CN-1822" `	"Who are you? Why are you asking me these questions?"`
	"CN-1823" `	"Reconnaissance missions, tracking pirate movements."`
	"CN-1824" `	"Sorry, I'm done talking to you."`
	"CN-1825" `	"Are you certain your reconnaissance was only targeted at pirates?" he asks. "Did they collect only your logs on pirate ships, or on every ship you saw?"`
	"CN-1826" `	"I honestly don't know."`
	"CN-1827" `	"I think it was only the pirate ships."`
	"CN-1828" `	"I just gave them all my logs. I'm not sure what parts of them they ended up using."`
	"CN-1829" `	"I see," he says. "I wonder why they didn't share more of the details of their work with you."`
	"CN-1830" `	"Why are you asking me all these questions?" you say.`
	"CN-1831" `	"I'm just collecting information," he says. "Anything you tell me is interesting to me." Then, with a mischievous grin, he adds, "Anything you refuse to tell me is also interesting. Anyway, I won't detain you any longer. Thank you for your time." He smiles and walks away, leaving you with no idea of what is going on.`
	"CN-1832" `	"Understood," he says. "Thank you for your time." He makes no effort to detain you, and walks away in the direction of the Navy garrison.`
	"CN-1833" `A man approaches you in the spaceport. "Hello. Would you be able to give me a lift to <destination>? I'd be able to pay you <payment>." You notice that he is dressed in a militia uniform.`
	"CN-1834" `	"Sure, I'd be glad to help!"`
	"CN-1835" `	"Sorry, I'm busy with something else right now."`
	"CN-1836" `	"Are you connected to the Free Worlds?"`
	"CN-1837" `	"Yes, I'm an officer in their militia." The man takes a half step back. "Is that a problem?"`
	"CN-1838" `	"No problem at all. I'd be glad to help with your cause!"`
	"CN-1839" `	"Not a problem, but I'm afraid I don't have space for you right now."`
	"CN-1840" `	"I don't help rebels. Find someone else."`
	"CN-1841" `When you walk into the spaceport bar, a man in a militia uniform flags you down, and says, "Captain <last>. One of my officers told me to keep an eye out for you. Would you be willing to do another small service for the Free Worlds?"`
	"CN-1842" `	"Perhaps. What do you want me to do?"`
	"CN-1843" `	"I only agreed to a transport job. I want no part in your rebellion."`
	"CN-1844" `	"It's a rather simple matter," he says. "Most of the Republic ships that have come through this system seem to be outfitted for surveillance, not combat. But there is one in orbit right now, the <npc>, that seems to be equipped as a warship. Would you be willing to scan its outfits and report to us what you find? The outfitter stocks scanners if you don't have one, though you might want to install a few of them to improve performance. We will pay <payment>."`
	"CN-1845" `	"Sure, that sounds simple enough."`
	"CN-1846" `	"Why can't you scan the ship yourself?"`
	"CN-1847" `	"I'm sure you understand the... tensions between the Free Worlds and the Republic at the moment. We're just trying to look out for ourselves, but we don't want to provoke anything with the Navy. It'd be much simpler if we could get a sympathetic merchant to scan the ship for us."`
	"CN-1848" `	"Sounds reasonable enough. I'll do it."`
	"CN-1849" `	"If shady jobs like this are what constitute 'helping the Free Worlds,' then count me out."`
	"CN-1850" `As soon as you scan the <npc> its captain hails you. "Excuse me, captain," he says, "can I assist you with something?"`
	"CN-1851" `	"I was just wondering what sort of engines you've got that let you move so fast."`
	"CN-1852" `	"Never mind sir, I was just admiring your... impressive equipment."`
	"CN-1853" `	"Nice, aren't they?" he says. "Atomic engines, the very latest in propulsion technology from Deep Sky. They're so smooth and responsive, I feel like I'm back piloting a shuttlecraft again."`
	"CN-1854" `	He pauses, then adds, "They pay me a thousand credits every time I say that."`
	"CN-1855" `	He looks awfully pleased with himself. "Yes, I suppose a ship like this is sure to turn a few heads. Next time we're on the same planet, stop by my berth and I'd be glad to give you a... private tour." He winks at you.`
	"CN-1856" `	You cut the commlink and breathe a sigh of relief that the conversation is over.`
	"CN-1857" `You meet up with the militia captain in the spaceport bar. "Glad you showed up," he says, "I'm Jean-Jacques, by the way, but you can call me JJ."`
	"CN-1858" `	You introduce yourself in return, and he continues. "Here's the deal. I'm the commander of the militia on Glaze. So far, we and the Navy are not shooting at each other, because no one wants to fire the first shot. But if they're getting ready to change that, they'll start refitting their Cruisers with heavy weaponry instead of surveillance equipment. So, I need to know how many more of their ships are equipped like the one you just scanned."`
	"CN-1859" `	He continues, "I'd like you to go to <waypoints>, where our reports say there's a build-up of Navy ships. Scan any ships you think match the Cruiser we just saw, then bring your scanner logs back here for me to look at."`
	"CN-1860" `	"Sure, I'd be glad to do that."`
	"CN-1861" `	"Sorry. After the way the last captain responded to me scanning him, I'm not risking my head for the Free Worlds again."`
	"CN-1862" `You meet JJ again in the bar. "I have one more reconnaissance mission for you," he says. "The Navy is building a base on New Wales, adjacent to the existing spaceport. From what I understand, they're employing thousands of locals to build it, so one more worker walking around would not seem out of place. I need you to walk around the base, take notes on the number and size of the landing pads and hangars, take pictures if you can, and report back to me. What do you say?"`
	"CN-1863" `	"What if they arrest me?"`
	"CN-1864" `	"From what I understand," says JJ, "the base is not actually closed off to civilians. So as long as you keep out of any areas that are marked off limits, you won't be committing any crime."`
	"CN-1865" `	"Okay, I'll do it."`
	"CN-1866" `	"This is too far. I'm not trespassing on Navy property for you."`
	"CN-1867" `	"I'm really sorry to hear that," says JJ. "We had high hopes for you." He leaves the bar.`
	"CN-1868" `You walk through the new section of the spaceport that the Navy is building, trying to look inconspicuous. When it seems that no one is watching, you snap a few photographs. You count seven hangars large enough to house a Carrier, and workers are clearing and blasting level surfaces for many more. An entire new village of identical prefabricated houses has sprung up nearby. And every few minutes, a warship flies overhead with a roar that shakes the entire mountain. It is an intimidating sight.`
	"CN-1869" `	As you are heading back to your ship after taking note of everything you think JJ would be interested in, two officers walk past you and you overhear one saying to the other, "Secret message from fleet command."`
	"CN-1870" `	You stop to tie your shoe and try to listen in. "What's the message?" asks the other.`
	"CN-1871" `	"I can't tell you here," says the first, and they duck behind one of the storage sheds.`
	"CN-1872" `	(Ignore them and return to my ship.)`
	"CN-1873" `	(Follow them and listen in.)`
	"CN-1874" `	You follow the officers into a supply yard and hide behind a large stack of crates. "Lieutenant," says one of them, "we just received word that the Free Worlds have contracted with someone to spy on this facility."`
	"CN-1875" `	"A professional, sir?"`
	"CN-1876" `	"Hardly. My grandmother would make a better spy. It's a merchant captain, clearly an amateur." They are both speaking quite loudly; you are having no trouble listening in.`
	"CN-1877" `	"What are we going to do, sir?" asks the lieutenant.`
	"CN-1878" `	"Nothing. If gawking at our ships were a crime, we'd have half the local population in prison by now. But if this captain should accept any further assignments, we may have to take action."`
	"CN-1879" `	"Should we at least inform this individual that those crates make terrible cover?" asks the lieutenant, grinning.`
	"CN-1880" `	"Now, now," says the other officer, "no need to be spiteful." They walk off, leaving you thoroughly embarrassed.`
	"CN-1881" `JJ meets you as soon as you land. "Good job evading that Navy Gunboat," he says.`
	"CN-1882" `	"Gunboat? What Gunboat?"`
	"CN-1883" `	"I knew I had a feeling that I was being followed."`
	"CN-1884" `	"You didn't notice? I have scouts that report that you were being followed by a Gunboat by the name of the <npc> ever since you left <origin>. Keeping an eye on where you were going, no doubt.`
	"CN-1885" `	"They knew I was gathering information on the base. It's no wonder they had someone following me."`
	"CN-1886" `	"How did they know I was involved with you?"`
	"CN-1887" `	"The Republic's intelligence gathering capabilities are vast, far beyond anything we can muster. I can only guess how they knew you were involved and kept an eye on you."`
	"CN-1888" `	"What should I do now that the Republic is watching me?"`
	"CN-1889" `	"Knowing that, how can you possibly expect to stand up against the Republic?"`
	"CN-1890" `	"Keep your head low. You're compromised, so I can't ask you to do any more recon work for us. So long as you don't cause them any trouble, they'll likely eventually leave you alone. We have a great number of merchants helping us, and as capable as the Republic is, they can only keep a close eye on so many people at a time."`
	"CN-1891" `	"I pray that we don't have to," JJ responds. "We're currently attempting to prove our innocence for the bombings on Geminus and Martini. But should it come to war, if we get continued help from merchants such as yourself, then, God willing, we might just stand a chance. While the Republic may be strong, they're not omnipotent."`
	"CN-1892" `	JJ takes the information and photos you gathered and pays you <payment> in return. "I'll be sure to let the rest of the Free Worlds Council know how helpful you have been."`
	"CN-1893" `	"Thank you."`
	"CN-1894" `	"What are you going to do with this information?"`
	"CN-1895" `	"Free Worlds Council? What's that?"`
	"CN-1896" `	"Full of questions, aren't we?" JJ chuckles. "We will not attack this naval base, so you don't need to worry about anyone being hurt by your actions today. But should the Free Worlds and the Republic go to war, information will be a vital resource, including the information that you've provided me, so thank you for that.`
	"CN-1897" `	"Full of questions, aren't we?" JJ chuckles. "The Council is a collection of leaders born out of what used to be the Southern Mutual Defense Pact. It includes myself and a few others. We are currently responsible for commanding the militias of the Free Worlds, and should it come to it, we will be the commanding officers in a war with the Republic.`
	"CN-1898" `	"Now if you'll excuse me, Captain, I have other work to attend to," JJ says. "If you wish to continue helping us, I'm sure there are others who could call upon you if you go looking for them."`
	"CN-1899" `As you are walking through the spaceport, a man in a militia uniform approaches you. Judging by the markings on his uniform, you suspect that he is very highly ranked within the militia.`
	"CN-1900" `	"Captain <last>?" he asks. You nod. "Glad to finally meet you. I'm Tomek Voigt, commanding officer of the Free militias. I have officers and friends who have spoken very highly of you. They tell me that you've gone to great lengths to help us. I thank you for that."`
	"CN-1901" `	"Oh, it was nothing. Just helping people out where I can."`
	"CN-1902" `	"I've gone to great lengths because I believe you have a great cause."`
	"CN-1903" `	"I'm just looking to get paid, and the Free Worlds pays well."`
	"CN-1904" `	Tomek raises an eyebrow. "A no nonsense captain, I see. Well if it's pay you're looking for, I have another job for you on behalf of the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-1905" `	Tomek smiles. "A humble captain, I see. Well, if you're just looking to help people out, I have another job for you on behalf of the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-1906" `	Tomek grins. "Ah, a fellow freedom fighter. Always glad to see more captains earnestly joining the cause. I have another job for you on behalf of the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-1907" `	"We're looking for ships to help escort a freighter convoy that is traveling to Tarazed to pick up supplies. Our last few convoys have been attacked by pirates, and we suspect this one will be as well. We already have a few captains on the job, but we could always use more help. Are you interested?"`
	"CN-1908" `	"Sure, I'd be glad to assist in the escort."`
	"CN-1909" `	"What sort of supplies?"`
	"CN-1910" `	"Sorry, but that's not the type of work I'm looking for."`
	"CN-1911" `	"Outfits, weapons, and other miscellaneous materials needed for the manufacturing of new ships. The Free Worlds are looking to bolster its forces, and we're already using as much of our local industry as we can, so we've begun importing materials from companies that aren't concerned with dealing with what the Republic labels a 'terrorist organization,'" Tomek says with a smirk.`
	"CN-1912" `	"Well, then I'd be glad to help."`
	"CN-1913" `	"Great!" he says. "The convoy will start from <destination> once all the escorts have arrived. I suggest you head there immediately."`
	"CN-1914" `You meet up with the convoy on <origin> in the spaceport: six freighters with an escort of... seven interceptors. Given how prevalent piracy is in this region and how strong some pirate fleets can be, you would have expected a larger escort, but it seems that this is all the Free Worlds are capable of mustering at the moment. It's no wonder they're asking merchant captains such as yourself to lend a hand.`
	"CN-1915" `	Shortly after you arrive, the convoy is ready to go and charts a course for <destination>.`
	"CN-1916" `Your convoy of freighters reaches <origin> intact, despite numerous encounters with pirates. The escort of interceptors was just enough to hold them off. The merchant captains sell their trade goods and stock up with weapons and ship outfits that will be used to build new ships for the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-1917" `	Before you leave, a Free Worlds militia officer who you didn't arrive with approaches you, saying that he's finished doing business with the Tarazed Corporation and will join the convoy back to <planet>. The officer is commanding a Falcon, a much more formidable warship than your group of interceptors. Which is good, since, now that the freighters are carrying much more valuable cargo, the pirate attacks are likely to get even worse...`
	"CN-1918" `Tomek is waiting in <origin>'s spaceport to receive the freighters. After double-checking that the cargo is all intact, he turns to you and the rest of the escort captains and says, "All of you have done a great service for the Free Worlds." He walks over and personally presents a credit chip to each captain.`
	"CN-1919" `	After handing over your payment, Tomek announces, "The convoy is heading back to <planet> immediately. Same deal as before: 400,000 credits for the safe return of the freighters, their crew, and their cargo. And I swear your courage will never be forgotten by the Council or the Free Worlds. If you're willing to volunteer a second time, please stay here."`
	"CN-1920" `	Tomek leaves, presumably to gather replacements for the captains who have already run off.`
	"CN-1921" `	(Volunteer.)`
	"CN-1922" `	(Ditch the escort group.)`
	"CN-1923" `	You stick around with a few of the other escort pilots and watch as most of the others wander away. Soon Tomek returns, luckily with some new faces in tow. "You know the drill," he says. "We can't afford to lose any of these freighters. Good luck to all of you, and I pray to see you all safely back here in a couple of weeks."`
	"CN-1924" `Once again, the convoy stocks up on weapons and outfits and begins preparing for the return journey. But unfortunately, there's no militia officer with a warship here to reinforce you this time. You can't help worrying that the longer these convoys keep running, the more pirates will discover their route and begin setting ambushes for them.`
	"CN-1925" `Once again, Tomek Voigt meets you and the rest of the convoy at the spaceport, thanks you all for your courage and dedication, and pays you each 400,000 credits. Afterwards, he pulls you aside and says, "Captain <last>, please follow me."`
	"CN-1926" `	Tomek brings you to one of the spaceport bars, exchanging greetings with the patrons before sitting at the counter. "Here's the deal," he says. "One of our freighters, the <npc>, was just disabled in the <waypoints> system. We need you to fly there immediately, repair it, and bring it back here before it can be captured by pirates. Do you think you're up to the task?"`
	"CN-1927" `	"Sure!"`
	"CN-1928" `	"Sorry, no. I'm a merchant captain with bills to pay. I'm not going to go search for your missing ships in the middle of nowhere."`
	"CN-1929" `	"Glad to hear it," he says. "The crew of that freighter is depending on you. I know I don't have to tell you what will happen to them if pirates board them before you get there, so get moving quickly."`
	"CN-1930" `Tomek is immensely relieved to see the <npc> returned safely home. "You have done us a great service today, Captain," he says, as he hands you credit chips for <payment>. "I'll be sure to let the rest of the Council know how helpful you have been, and I pray we can call on you in the future."`
	"CN-1931" `	"I'll be ready to answer the call whenever it comes."`
	"CN-1932" `	"What exactly is the Council?"`
	"CN-1933" `	Tomek pauses to think for a moment. "Before there was the Free Worlds, there was the Southern Mutual Defense Pact, little more than a defense agreement between the worlds that now comprise the Free Worlds. Any group needs leadership, and the Council is what was once the leadership of the Pact.`
	"CN-1934" `	"We've retained all our powers that we held under the Pact, being the organizers and commanding officers of the various militias of the Free Worlds. With the Free Worlds having declared itself as a formal government and with tensions with the Republic so high, however, the militias are now obligated to answer to the Council as an emergency power, as opposed to the prior agreement where worlds could refuse to answer to the Pact if, for whatever reason, they chose not to.`
	"CN-1935" `	"But the Council is only a transitional organization; upon the establishment of the Free Worlds Senate, which is already in the works, the Council will be dissolved and all its responsibilities moved to the Senate.`
	"CN-1936" `	"Does that answer your question?" Tomek asks.`
	"CN-1937" `	"It does," you say. "Thank you."`
	"CN-1938" `Soon after you exit your ship a man approaches you. "Captain <last>?" he asks. You nod. "My name is Alondo," he says. "I'm a member of the Free Worlds Council. Katya speaks so highly of you that I would like to see you officially join us as a part of the Free Worlds militia, even though you messed up that escort mission that was given to you."`
	"CN-1939" `	"Yes, I'm very sorry about that."`
	"CN-1940" `	"Sorry, but I decided I don't want to assist the Free Worlds anyway."`
	"CN-1941" `	"I'm sure," he says, "but I'm not the one you need to say that to. Right now Tomek is refusing to let us offer you a job, but if you speak with him in person, he might change his mind. Or he might not. But if you really want to work for us, you should visit him on <planet>, take full responsibility for what happened, and apologize. Just a suggestion." He walks off.`
	"CN-1942" `Nervously, you contact Tomek and ask if he would be willing to meet with you. After a long pause, he says, "Okay. Meet me at the cantina in fifteen minutes." You wait for about twenty minutes before he finally shows up and says, without preamble, "Now, what do you have to say for yourself?"`
	"CN-1943" `	"I take full responsibility for the loss of that freighter. I'm sorry."`
	"CN-1944" `	"There was really nothing I could have done against so many pirates."`
	"CN-1945" `	"I'm sorry for what happened. It won't happen again."`
	"CN-1946" `	He doesn't look entirely satisfied with that response. "I had to write letters to five different families telling them why their son or daughter or husband had been killed on a routine cargo mission. You promised to keep them safe, and you failed. You understand that, right?"`
	"CN-1947" `	"Well, space is a dangerous place. Bad things happen. I can't stop that."`
	"CN-1948" `	"Yes, I know that I failed, and I'm very sorry for their loss."`
	"CN-1949" `	"That is not an appropriate response," he says. "If we offer you a mission, we have to be able to trust that you will complete it, with no excuses. I'm sorry, but I have no interest in working with you in the future. Goodbye, Captain." He walks away.`
	"CN-1950" `	"If we offer you a mission in the future," he says, "we have to be able to trust that you will complete it. No excuses, no second tries. Do you understand?" You nod. "Fine," he says, with a long sigh. "Katya said she trusts you, so I'll give you a second chance this one time. But please try to be more responsible in the future, okay?"`
	"CN-1951" `	"I will. Thank you for giving me a second chance, sir."`
	"CN-1952" `	"I'll try my best."`
	"CN-1953" `	He shakes your hand and leaves, without ordering anything to drink. You get the feeling that he still does not think very highly of you.`
	"CN-1954" `As you walk through the spaceport, a woman in a militia uniform approaches you. "Are you Captain <last>?" she asks. You nod. "I'm a commander of the local militia," she says. "There's a pirate fleet that has attacked freighters in this sector several times in the last few months, but now it seems they've moved outside of Free space. I'd like to strike at them before they return and do more damage here, but right now the Free Worlds Council won't allow militia ships to be used for preemptive attacks, so instead we're looking to enlist the help of a merchant captain, and I was told that you're a formidable pilot."`
	"CN-1955" `	"Well, I'd be glad to destroy them for you."`
	"CN-1956" `	"How powerful of a fleet do these pirates have?"`
	"CN-1957" `	"How much will you be paying me to take out this fleet?"`
	"CN-1958" `	"I don't want to have anything to do with the Free Worlds."`
	"CN-1959" `	"Well they aren't exactly a powerful fleet. They're just a collection of interceptors, but they're numerous and swift enough that we've had trouble taking them down before they can run or swarm our larger ships. We can pay you <payment> if you can take them out."`
	"CN-1960" `	"Just a group of interceptors? That should be no problem for me to destroy."`
	"CN-1961" `	"If you can't take them out then I don't know how I will. You're on your own."`
	"CN-1962" `	"Since these pirates have been particularly troublesome, we've placed a bounty of <payment> on their heads. Take them out for us and those credits are all yours."`
	"CN-1963" `	"That sounds reasonable enough. Okay, I'll destroy them for you."`
	"CN-1964" `	"Only <payment>? You're going to need to find someone else for the job."`
	"CN-1965" `	"Excellent," she says. "They call themselves the 'Rat Pack,' and you'll recognize them because most of their ships are named after various vermin, although for some unknown reason their flagship is just named 'Cluny.' They were last seen in the Seginus system, just northeast of Free space, so they'll probably be within a jump or two of there. Thank you in advance for your help."`
	"CN-1966" `A Free Worlds officer waves to you as you are walking through the spaceport. "Hello Captain <last>," he says. "I've heard you've helped us in the past to deal with pirate threats. Interested in another bounty hunting mission?"`
	"CN-1967" `	"What will it be this time?"`
	"CN-1968" `	"Sure, I do love destroying pirates!"`
	"CN-1969" `	"Sorry, I'm way too busy right now."`
	"CN-1970" `	"There's a retrofitted heavy freighter by the name of <npc> that has been stealing large amounts of cargo from our supply convoys. It was last seen in the Delta Sagittarii system. Be warned that this ship is a tough one, fitted with more Heavy Lasers than I've ever seen anyone install on a single ship, but it's slow as a sloth, so you might be able to hit it from afar. The bounty on it is <payment>."`
	"CN-1971" `	"Sounds like this shouldn't be too difficult. I'm in."`
	"CN-1972" `	"I could handle a group of interceptors, but this sounds like too much for me. You'll have to find someone else."`
	"CN-1973" `	He grins. "Glad to hear you're on board. Good luck, Captain."`
	"CN-1974" `	He grins. "Your target is a retrofitted heavy freighter by the name of <npc> that has been stealing large amounts of cargo from our supply convoys. It was last seen in the Delta Sagittarii system. Be warned that this ship is a tough one, fitted with more Heavy Lasers than I've ever seen anyone install on a single ship, but it's slow as a sloth, so you might be able to hit it from afar. Good luck, Captain."`
	"CN-1975" `Once again, as you are walking through the spaceport a Free Worlds officer flags you down. "We've got another bounty hunting mission for you," he says. "This one is a bit more dangerous; this pirate ship has weapons we've never seen before, that may be alien in origin. Interested in helping us to destroy it?"`
	"CN-1976" `	"Yes, I'm sure my ship will be up to the challenge."`
	"CN-1977" `	"Alien in origin? What sort of weapons does it have?"`
	"CN-1978" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested in giving the Free Worlds more assistance."`
	"CN-1979" `	"It has a pair of strange cannons that seem to interfere with a ship's electrical systems, draining its power and causing its weapons to malfunction. It's similar to those lasers the Quarg have, which is why we think the weapons are alien technology."`
	"CN-1980" `	"Well you came to the right person. I'll take it out for you."`
	"CN-1981" `	"Sorry, but that sounds like a job for someone else."`
	"CN-1982" `	"Great," he says. "Your target is named the <npc>. After we nearly destroyed it, we think it went to the Shaula system to hide out, which means that you'll probably have to deal with other pirates at the same time. Good luck, Captain."`
	"CN-1983" `Wandering through the spaceport, you have stopped for a moment to read the menu posted in front of a restaurant, when your thoughts are interrupted by the click of a gun being cocked right behind your head, and a woman's voice saying, "Think fast, Captain."`
	"CN-1984" `	(Do this karate move I saw in a video one time.)`
	"CN-1985" `	(Raise my hands slowly into the air and find out what she wants.)`
	"CN-1986" `	"Good choice," she says. "Now, turn around, slowly, and don't try any funny business. I've got a semiautomatic pistol pointed right at your head."`
	"CN-1987" `	(Now, try that karate move.)`
	"CN-1988" `	(Turn around slowly.)`
	"CN-1989" `	You turn around and find yourself facing a woman in a Free Worlds uniform. The chevrons on her collar mark her as some sort of officer. She is grinning at you. "Beautifully done, Captain," she says. "Such restraint. Such remarkable levelheadedness. Not something I often see around here. If this thing were loaded, quite a few backcountry rubes in the last few months would've had their brains blown open before I could even get around to recruiting them." She lowers the gun.`
	"CN-1990" `	"You mean this was some sort of test? You're not trying to mug me?"`
	"CN-1991" `	(Try that karate move, just for kicks.)`
	"CN-1992" `	You make a grab for the gun. A second later she's got your arm twisted behind your back, using just enough force to make it clear that things could get really painful if you continue to struggle. "Smart, and playful too," she says, "I like that. But, it'll be a cold day in hell before a kid like you gets the drop on me. Now, shall we talk?" She lets go of you, and you shake out your arm gingerly.`
	"CN-1993" `	"I need a civilian for some courier work," she says. "Nothing illegal, at least nothing the Republic can pin on you. It just needs to be done by a ship that isn't flying our colors, and by a captain who isn't going to scream, 'Death to all tyrants!' and go in with guns blazing the first time your cargo gets scanned. What do you say?"`
	"CN-1994" `	"I'm not sure I'm ready to pick sides in this war, yet."`
	"CN-1995" `	"Why would I help a group of terrorists?"`
	"CN-1996" `	"Okay, tell me more."`
	"CN-1997" `	"Look, kid," she says. "When I ask you to pick sides, when I offer you a mission that's gonna burn some bridges for you, I won't be sneaky about it. I'll tell you exactly what you're signing up for. What I'm offering you now is just a chance to get to know us, and let us get to know you, with no expectations. Heck, you can even run missions for the Reps at the same time."`
	"CN-1998" `	"That sounds fair. I'll hear you out."`
	"CN-1999" `	"I don't like working with people who start conversations by pointing guns at my head. Even unloaded guns. Find someone else to do this job for you."`
	"CN-2000" `	"Look, kid," she says. "I know the situation looks bad, but I'm telling the truth when I say that the Free Worlds aren't the ones who dropped those nukes, and we don't know who did, either. So I'll proudly be called treasonous for separating from the Republic, but I will not tolerate being called a terrorist."`
	"CN-2001" `	"And what reason do I have to believe you?"`
	"CN-2002" `	"I'm not convinced. You'll need to find some other sucker to do your dirty work for you."`
	"CN-2003" `	She pauses for a moment. "You don't have a reason," she says with a sigh. "Sometimes you just need to take things on faith."`
	"CN-2004" `	"Alright, I'm willing to hear you out."`
	"CN-2005" `	"Well I don't have a lot of faith in people who start conversations by pointing guns at my head. Even unloaded guns. Find someone else to do this job for you."`
	"CN-2006" `	"Okay, here's the deal. We need some cargo carried from <planet> to Skymoot. It's just medical supplies - no bombs, no contraband. But we'll load it onto your ship in the dead of night, trying our best to avoid any notice. But the Reps have the sharpest eyes in the galaxy, so you'll get noticed anyway. And since anything done in the dead of night is likely to arouse their suspicions, you'll get boarded and searched. Meanwhile, the real cargo will have been loaded onto one of our ships in broad daylight, and will pass through Republic space entirely unnoticed."`
	"CN-2007" `	"I like the way you think. Count me in."`
	"CN-2008" `	"Sorry, it sounds a bit too shady for my liking. Please don't offer me any work in the future."`
	"CN-2009" `	"Shucks," she says, "I liked you. I was looking forward to having you on my team." She looks genuinely crestfallen. "But fair is fair. You're free to go, and I'll tell my colleagues that you're not interested in working for us."`
	"CN-2010" `	"Great," she says, grinning even more broadly. "My name's Katya Reynolds, by the way. Glad we'll be working together." She starts to walk away, then seems to remember something. "One last thing - some friends of mine on <planet>, tourists, need a lift off that rock, and I owe them a favor. Would you mind saving two bunks for them?"`
	"CN-2011" `	"Sure, no problem."`
	"CN-2012" `	"Excellent. I'm looking forward to doing business with you, Captain."`
	"CN-2013" `	You dodge sideways and spin quickly. As you do so you hear a loud click, but the gun does not fire. With one hand you knock aside the gun. With the other you land a karate chop which, if you had studied karate, would've shattered her collarbone and left her reeling in pain. But since you have not studied karate, instead your blow bounces harmlessly off her surprisingly muscular shoulder.`
	"CN-2014" `	Your assailant turns out to be wearing a Free Worlds uniform and a disappointed expression. "Well aren't you a dumb reckless bastard!" she says, "I'd hoped for something better from you. First of all, if this gun were loaded, your brains would be splattered all over the sidewalk. And second, you fight like a girl. I have no use for hotheads like you." She stalks off, leaving you very confused. It would appear that you've just failed some sort of test.`
	"CN-2015" `	(Let her go.)`
	"CN-2016" `	"Oh yeah? Well you ARE a girl!"`
	"CN-2017" `	She turns back around, with a fearsome gleam in her eyes, and walks up to you until your faces are only inches apart. "Yeah, but I don't fight like one," she says. "I... fight like a she-badger."`
	"CN-2018" `	"A she... badger?"`
	"CN-2019" `	"Fearsome creatures." She walks away, leaving you even more confused.`
	"CN-2020" `Soon after you land, a middle-aged tourist couple approach you and ask if you'd be willing to take them to Skymoot, "to see the dragons. Katerina recommended you." You tell them you would be glad to.`
	"CN-2021" `	The man, who is wearing floral print shorts and carrying an absurdly large camera, introduces himself as Marty. "And this is my wife, Sarah," he adds. "Would you mind taking a picture of us?" They pose in front of your ship. "Better take two pictures in case she blinks," says Marty. As you help them bring their oversized suitcases on board, you can't help wondering why Katya would be friends with such a quintessential pair of rich, uncultured buffoons.`
	"CN-2022" `	Much later that night, as planned, three shadowy figures load a set of unmarked crates into your cargo bay. Katya assured you that the contents are harmless, just intended to distract the Republic security officers, but you can't help feeling like you're getting involved in something shady.`
	"CN-2023" `When you land on <planet>, before your engines have even had a chance to cool, Katya comes aboard your ship. When she sees your passengers, she breaks into a wide grin. "Lynn!" she says, running up and hugging the woman who introduced herself as "Sarah." Then she turns to "Marty" and says, "And Henry! So good to see you both. Captain <last>, allow me to introduce you to Professor Lynn Anderson, one of the galaxy's premier planetary scientists, and her husband Henry, a former Navy intelligence officer."`
	"CN-2024" `	"Pleased to meet you both. Why the deception?"`
	"CN-2025" `	"Wait a minute... were they the secret cargo?"`
	"CN-2026" `	Katya explains, "The Andersons are defecting to the Free Worlds. Their dream is to make terraforming a public service, supported by government funds, rather than a luxury available only to the richest of planets. We worked for years to get Parliament to accept that idea, but with no luck. And because of Henry's background and knowledge about the intelligence community, the Republic would have stopped them if they knew they were defecting."`
	"CN-2027" `	She adds, "The real secret cargo, which arrived several days ago via a faster ship, was their personal possessions and Lynn's lab equipment and instruments, which were loaded onto a ship supposedly bound for Hestia."`
	"CN-2028" `	"We had just rented a cottage there," says Henry, "saying we were downsizing. We'll lose the security deposit, of course, but it gave us an excuse to pack up and move."`
	"CN-2029" `	Katya says, "You might not guess it from the outfit he's wearing, but Henry is an absolute mastermind at subtlety and misdirection. He planned the whole thing." She hands you a credit chip for <payment>. "Thanks so much for your help. If you're willing to continue helping the Free Worlds, meet me in the spaceport bar in half an hour."`
	"CN-2030" `When you land on <origin> and open your ship's main hatch, you find yourself facing a Navy officer with several armed guards in tow. He says, "Sorry captain, but you've been selected for a random cargo screening."`
	"CN-2031" `	(Let them in.)`
	"CN-2032" `	(Attack them.)`
	"CN-2033" `	(Shut the hatch and escape into space.)`
	"CN-2034" `	You draw your gun while screaming "Death to all tyrants!" The officer shouts in alarm and dives out of the way. His companions, who turn out to be wearing body armor, open fire. You die quickly. Katya will be very disappointed.`
	"CN-2035" `	You slam the hatch shut in their faces, quickly fire up your engines, and flee for the sky. Before you have even broken out of the atmosphere, your communicator picks up a broadcast message marking you as a wanted criminal. Also, your radar informs you that several Navy vessels are on your tail.`
	"CN-2036" `	You let the officer and his companions into your cargo bay. They immediately zero in on the crates that were loaded up during the night. One of the guards runs a quick scan and says, "No explosives, no radiation."`
	"CN-2037" `	The Navy officer says, "Would you mind telling us what's in these crates?"`
	"CN-2038" `	"Just medical supplies. Surgical gear, mostly."`
	"CN-2039" `	"Just some secret illegal things."`
	"CN-2040" `	"I've never seen those crates before in my life. I don't know where they came from."`
	"CN-2041" `	"Any biological material or restricted medications?" he asks.`
	"CN-2042" `	"No, sir," you say.`
	"CN-2043" `	He laughs. "Sorry," he says, "you probably think we're just being paranoid, but rules are rules." Clearly he took what you said as a joke.`
	"CN-2044" `	He frowns. "We're going to have to frisk you," he says. One of the guards pats you down and takes your gun and your pocketknife. "Have a seat," says the officer. They force you to sit on the ground, and one of the guards points a very large gun at you.`
	"CN-2045" `	He says, "I'm afraid we're going to have to search these crates." The guards grab a couple of crowbars and begin prying the lids off them. The contents turn out to be relatively innocuous, although one box full of scalpels and other surgical implements gives them pause. As they open crate after crate without finding anything incriminating, you can tell the officer is getting more and more frustrated and uncomfortable. When the last crate turns out to contain nothing but bandages and gauze pads, his frustration turns to embarrassment. They re-pack the crates and nail the lids back on.`
	"CN-2046" `	"I'm sorry," says the officer, "we must have been responding to a bad tip. I'm very sorry for this invasion of your privacy, Captain."`
	"CN-2047" `	"Never mind, I know you're just doing your job."`
	"CN-2048" `	"Since when has the Republic gotten so heavy handed about searching civilian ships?"`
	"CN-2049" `	"You are very gracious, Captain. We will not detain you any longer." They leave.`
	"CN-2050" `	"I am sorry, Captain. Since the terrorist attacks everyone has been on edge. I hope you won't think badly of us." They leave.`
	"CN-2051" `As you are walking through the spaceport, someone calls out, "Captain <last>!" A Free Worlds officer is approaching you; you recognize her as the same woman who pulled a gun on you earlier as a way to "test" you. "I apologize for pulling that trick on you before," she says. "My name is Katya Reynolds. I've heard really good things about you from some other members of the Free Worlds Council, and I'm hoping you'd reconsider working with me."`
	"CN-2052" `	"Okay, as long as you don't point any more guns at me."`
	"CN-2053" `	"No. I just don't like you. Or the Free Worlds."`
	"CN-2054" `	"Great," she says. "Here's the deal. I have a friend named Mr. Eyes, who needs a lift from <destination>. For his safety, I'd rather not tell you anything about his work, but I assure you he's an upstanding citizen. A little unpopular with big corporations and certain corrupt local governments, though. Can you give him a lift?"`
	"CN-2055" `	"Sure, I would be glad to."`
	"CN-2056" `	"This sounds too shady. Find someone else to help you."`
	"CN-2057" `When you enter the bar, Katya waves you over to her table. "I've got another friend who needs to be transported," she says. "This one is on a boondock planet near the Core right now."`
	"CN-2058" `	"Sure, I'd be glad to transport him."`
	"CN-2059" `	"Sorry, but I've decided working for the Free Worlds just isn't worth the risk."`
	"CN-2060" `	"Great!" she says. "His name is Mr. Eyes, and he'll meet you on <destination>. For his safety, I'd rather not tell you anything about his work, but I assure you he's an upstanding citizen. A little unpopular with big corporations and certain corrupt planetary governments, though."`
	"CN-2061" `As soon as you land and open your ship's hatch, a man wearing sunglasses and a ridiculous hat and carrying a large metal suitcase runs past you and into your ship, casting a quick furtive glance behind him to see if anyone is following.`
	"CN-2062" `	(Draw my weapon to defend myself against him.)`
	"CN-2063" `	(Quickly shut the hatch and find out if he is okay.)`
	"CN-2064" `	You shut the hatch to keep anyone else from boarding your ship uninvited, then confront him. "Who are you and what are you doing on my ship?" you ask.`
	"CN-2065" `	You shut the hatch to keep anyone else from boarding your ship, then turn around to find out who your visitor is. "My name is <first>," you say. "How can I help you?"`
	"CN-2066" `	"I'm Ijs Springborn," he says, pronouncing the name like "Eyes." He takes off the glasses and hat. "Councilor Reynolds told me to meet you here."`
	"CN-2067" `	"Wait, 'Councilor' Reynolds? You mean Katya is in Parliament?"`
	"CN-2068" `	He looks genuinely shocked. "You didn't know? That woman is a legend. Did two terms representing the Dirt Belt. Defender of small worlds and the common people. In some circles her work has made her almost as unpopular as me. But she got tired of working for reform and decided to create her own government instead."`
	"CN-2069" `	"And what do you do for work?" you ask.`
	"CN-2070" `	"Vigilante nuclear power plant inspector," he says, nonchalantly.`
	"CN-2071" `	"Um... what?"`
	"CN-2072" `	"How does that even work?"`
	"CN-2073" `	"Is that even legal?"`
	"CN-2074" `	"I go from world to world checking out plant emissions, to see if they're leaking isotopes into the air, the sea, or the groundwater. And if they are I sic the Department of Atomic Safety on them. The Syndicate hates my guts right now."`
	"CN-2075" `	"So, what has Katya asked you to do for the Free Worlds?" you ask.`
	"CN-2076" `	"Isn't it obvious?" he says. "We're going to hunt down certain naughty people who have been developing nuclear weapons, and the Free Worlds will turn them over to the Republic. Then the Republic will know that the Free Worlds weren't behind the attacks, and we'll stop this whole mess before it devolves into a civil war."`
	"CN-2077" `	"So, you're convinced that the Free Worlds are innocent?"`
	"CN-2078" `	"Okay, what's our plan to do that?"`
	"CN-2079" `	"Absolutely," he says. "It makes no sense. First of all, that attack hurt their cause more than it helped it. And second, I've known Katerina and her friends in the Free Worlds for a long time. There's no way they would agree to such a thing. So, whoever is responsible is out there somewhere, and the Free Worlds will bring them to justice."`
	"CN-2080" `	"Well, then, what's our plan?"`
	"CN-2081" `	"First," he says, "we need to go to Geminus, where the attack happened. I can explain more when we get there. In the meantime, I should also warn you that I seem to have terrible luck with pirates showing up wherever I go. It's almost like someone has put a price on my head." He grins.`
	"CN-2082" `It turns out that the suitcase Mr. Eyes is carrying is full of portable sensors. He fires them up while explaining to you what he is doing. "Each world, and even each mine, has a slightly different mix of isotopes in their fissionable elements," he explains. "So what I'm doing right now is almost like taking a fingerprint. Once we've got it, we can try to find a match on another planet. I'd be willing to bet the material just came from a civilian reactor core, so tracking it back to the mine wouldn't necessarily incriminate anyone. But developing nukes is tricky, so they probably did tests. And if we can find the test site, that may lead us to the perpetrators."`
	"CN-2083" `	A few minutes later, his measurements are done. "Got it," he says. "Time to start hunting. Katya said to meet up with her on <planet>. It's not our best bet, but it's on the list of suspects."`
	"CN-2084" `As soon as you land, Mr. Eyes fires up his sensors and begins collecting data. A few minutes later, Katya shows up. "Eyes!" she says. "It's great to see you again."`
	"CN-2085" `	"You too, Councilor," he says.`
	"CN-2086" `	Katya hands you a credit chip for another <payment>. "Thanks again, Captain. Did Eyes explain the plan to you?" You nod. "Well," she says, "if you've got space for the two of us and want to be a part of seeing justice done, let's meet up in the spaceport once Eyes is done analyzing his data."`
	"CN-2087" `You find Eyes and Katya sitting in the shade of one of the few trees in the port, drinking some sort of frozen milkshakes while they stare out at the desert and talk in hushed voices. When you join them, Katya says, "I was just filling Eyes in on the Navy's recent fleet mobilization. Half the Dirt Belt is swarming with Cruisers and surveillance drones right now. It's hard to believe that we can find the attackers before they do, unless they're somewhere the Navy hasn't thought to look."`
	"CN-2088" `	"Agreed," says Eyes, "and to make matters worse, their sensors are probably much better than mine."`
	"CN-2089" `	Katya appears to be struck by a sudden idea. "The sensors on their drones," she says, "their unmanned drones..."`
	"CN-2090" `	Eyes glances at her, sees her expression, and says, "No, Councilor, don't even think of it. That's a horrible idea."`
	"CN-2091" `	"No," she says, "it's brilliant. Captain <last>, are you familiar with the Dereliction and Salvage Act of 2976?"`
	"CN-2092" `	"No, I've never heard of it."`
	"CN-2093" `	"Of course. I read parliamentary proceedings every night when I'm trying to fall asleep."`
	"CN-2094" `	"Well then," she says, "you'll probably agree that legally speaking, Navy surveillance drones count as abandoned goods the moment their owners have left the system."`
	"CN-2095" `	"Well," she says, "it started when the Syndicate began experimenting with fully automated mining facilities on uninhabitable planets. Pirates started raiding the mines to steal equipment, and the Syndicate claimed that these installations were 'colonies' and it was the Navy's job to defend them. The Act was Parliament's response, stating that taking goods from a human being is piracy, but if the owner or some living representative of theirs is not present in the system, taking those goods is a legal salvage operation. The point was to keep the Navy from being obligated to defend every equipment cache or abandoned station in the galaxy. But by the same law, those Navy surveillance drones become abandoned goods the moment their motherships leave the system."`
	"CN-2096" `	"Yup. That makes perfect sense to me."`
	"CN-2097" `	"So first you have me smuggling people across the galaxy, and now you want me to attack Navy ships? Next you'll ask me to start taking prisoners."`
	"CN-2098" `	"That sounds like a terrible idea."`
	"CN-2099" `	Eyes laughs, spitting out his milkshake in the process. "We won't be asking you to do anything of that sort," Katya responds somewhat aggressively. "Look, if we want to track down who dropped those bombs then we need to get our hands on better scanning equipment, equipment that the Navy has on their unmanned surveillance drones, and you're the one with a ship unconnected to the Free Worlds. All you need to do is find a lone surveillance drone to plunder. Legally the Navy can't do anything about it, and no one will be hurt in the process. If we succeed in finding who's responsible for the bombings, we could prevent war between the Republic and the Free Worlds, saving thousands or even potentially millions of lives. So are you with us or not?"`
	"CN-2100" `	"Are you saying we're going to need to find a different captain to work with?" says Katya. "If we want to track down who dropped those bombs then we need to get our hands on better scanning equipment, equipment that the Navy has on their unmanned surveillance drones. All you need to do is find a lone surveillance drone to plunder. Legally the Navy can't do anything about it, and no one will be hurt in the process. If we succeed in finding who's responsible for the bombings, we could prevent war between the Republic and the Free Worlds, saving thousands or even potentially millions of lives. So are you with us or not?"`
	"CN-2101" `	"Fine, I'll do it. But I still think it's an unwise idea."`
	"CN-2102" `	"Even still, that doesn't justify destroying Navy property. Count me out."`
	"CN-2103" `	"If this is the sort of reasoning the Free Worlds runs on, then you can kiss goodbye to working with me ever again."`
	"CN-2104" `	"Great!" says Katya. "All we have to do is disable a drone, board it, yank out the surveillance equipment, and bring it back here to test it out."`
	"CN-2105" `	Ijs says, "Captain, we should warn you: when you attack a drone, any Republic folks in that system will get mad at you. But once you jump out of the system, they'll calm down again."`
	"CN-2106" `You hand over the "salvaged" equipment to Mr. Eyes and Katya. Eyes begins fiddling with it, and soon discovers how to work the atmospheric scanner. "This is really nice stuff!" he says, enthusiastically.`
	"CN-2107" `	Katya says, "We found a halfway decent restaurant in the spaceport village. If you want to keep working with us, meet us there this evening."`
	"CN-2108" `You join Katya and Mr. Eyes in the restaurant, and order your meals. They are both in high spirits. While you are waiting for the food to arrive, Mr. Eyes raises his glass of wine and says, "A toast, to Captain <last> and our marvelous new toy. May it bring us good information and swift justice."`
	"CN-2109" `	"We're thinking that while we're in the area, we should stop on <planet> next," says Katya, "and then work our way toward the Rim."`
	"CN-2110" `	Your meals arrive. The food is excellent, and you spend a relaxed evening sharing stories of your childhoods. Katya turns out to be a Dirt Belt native<dirt belt origin> from a planet named Hope. "No longer settled," she explains. "Supervolcano. It was a cold planet to start out with, and the eruption sent it into an ice age that could last for millennia. My home town is under thirty meters of glacier by now."`
	"CN-2111" `	"Was anyone killed?"`
	"CN-2112" `	"How did you escape?"`
	"CN-2113" `	"The eruption was on the other continent," she explains, "so no one was killed in the blast. It was a slow-moving disaster. We had six months or so to move two million settlers off-world before the temperatures would drop too low to be livable. More than half of the Navy was mobilized to ferry our people to other planets."`
	"CN-2114" `	"Here's the best part," says Eyes. "The Navy operates with a certain amount of autonomy. Turns out when they found out about the disaster, they mobilized without even waiting to clear it with Parliament. Which was technically within their mandate, this being a natural disaster. But the Navy is funded by taxes, and the Paradise Planets pay ten times as much in taxes as the Dirt Belt."`
	"CN-2115" `	"The Paradise Planets viewed the Navy as their own private security force," says Katya, "so they got really mad when half the Navy suddenly vanished to assist some dirty refugees. Because those admirals gave the order to assist us, millions of lives were saved. And then Parliament fired them."`
	"CN-2116" `	"You're making the Navy sound like heroes. I thought they were your enemies."`
	"CN-2117" `	"You've almost convinced me to join the Navy."`
	"CN-2118" `	"Our fight isn't with the Navy," says Katya. "Most of them are good people. I'm sure they don't want war any more than we do. They're like police officers who are suddenly being asked to fight against the very people they swore to protect and serve."`
	"CN-2119" `	"I was a child on Vinci while this was happening," says Eyes. "A Paradise World. I would listen to the news and could never understand why all the adults around me were so very, very angry that the Navy had gone off to rescue two million people from freezing to death. But they told me that we lived in one little island of safety in a dangerous galaxy, and that without the Navy protecting us the pirates or even maybe aliens would sweep in and destroy our homes and take our money. That it was us against the whole galaxy."`
	"CN-2120" `	"I'd hate to be rich," says Katya. "So much to fear."`
	"CN-2121" `	You finish your meal (Katya pays the tab), and agree to take off for <planet> first thing in the morning.`
	"CN-2122" `You land on <origin>, and Mr. Eyes fires up the new Navy surveillance equipment to make atmospheric measurements. "Nothing here," he says after a few minutes. "Guess we should move on."`
	"CN-2123" `	"Are we just going to search every planet in this sector? Won't that take months?"`
	"CN-2124" `	"Are there any other ships helping us search, or is it just us?"`
	"CN-2125" `	"You've got a point," says Eyes. "And we don't even know for sure that the terrorists originated from around here. Without any additional information, we're looking for a needle in a galaxy-sized haystack."`
	"CN-2126" `	"No," says Eyes, "we've tried to keep this search a secret so the terrorists won't know we're looking for them. Any group with the resources to develop nuclear weapons likely has the resources to also cover their tracks, and if they know we're coming for them, they could make our job even harder than it already is."`
	"CN-2127" `	Katya says, "What we need is some leads to follow. I bet we could buy information on Greenrock. Whenever anyone is doing something illegal in this sector, there's a good chance the pirates are helping them."`
	"CN-2128" `	Mr. Eyes says, "Unless you've got boatloads of money to give the pirates, we need someone who's friendly with them, who can convince them to talk for free. We should go to the Brothers on Harmony."`
	"CN-2129" `	"That's not a bad idea," says Katya, "as long as they don't make me sit through one of their church services. I'm usually all for service, but theirs always makes me fall asleep."`
	"CN-2130" `	"What do you say, Captain?" asks Eyes. "Want to visit a monastery?"`
	"CN-2131" `	"Sure, sounds like fun."`
	"CN-2132" `	"You guys have interesting friends. How do you know these monks?"`
	"CN-2133" `	"Sounds boring. Can't we go shoot down more surveillance drones instead?"`
	"CN-2134" `	"When I grew up and left the Paradise sector, as a young idealist," says Eyes, "I decided I wanted to take a vow of poverty, so I came to live with the Brothers. But it turns out they also wanted me to take a vow of obedience. And chastity. Not so much my cup of tea." He winks at Katya.`
	"CN-2135" `	"Are the monks really as boring as Katya says?" you ask.`
	"CN-2136" `	"Sorry kid," says Eyes. "Take it from me, working for justice is not always exciting."`
	"CN-2137" `	"Fine, I'm in."`
	"CN-2138" `	"Sorry, but I think I'm done with helping the Free Worlds. I'd rather strike out on my own."`
	"CN-2139" `Katya and Eyes lead you to the monastery. As you are approaching, you meet a monk who is wearing a long black robe and kneeling in a small vegetable garden, pulling weeds. When he looks up and sees you, he leaps to his feet and runs over. "Katya! And Ijs! Welcome back!" Then he turns to you. "I'm David," he says.`
	"CN-2140" `	"I'm <first>. Pleased to meet you."`
	"CN-2141" `	Katya asks, "Is Brother Greg here?"`
	"CN-2142" `	"He is," says David. "Come inside." The monastery building is a stone and brick structure that looks like pictures you have seen of ancient Earth. He leads you down a long hallway and into a sitting room with furniture that looks equally antique, then leaves.`
	"CN-2143" `	As you are waiting, Eyes explains, "Brother Greg is in charge of the monastery's outreach and ministry to pirate crew members."`
	"CN-2144" `	"That sounds even odder than being a vigilante nuclear inspector."`
	"CN-2145" `	"Why would anyone want to reach out to pirates?"`
	"CN-2146" `	Eyes laughs. "Yes, the monks were a big influence in helping me to think creatively about my own vocation."`
	"CN-2147" `	"Consider this," says Katya. "In the galactic south, the average age of a pirate crew member is seventeen years old. And many are much younger than that. They're more like street kids than like hardened criminals."`
	"CN-2148" `	Just then, Brother Greg walks in. Mr. Eyes introduces you to him and explains your situation. Greg frowns, thoughtfully. "What do we have to offer in exchange for that information?" he asks.`
	"CN-2149" `	Katya says, "Ever since the bombings, Southern space has been swarming not only with an increased militia presence, but with the whole Republic Navy. That must make it awfully hard to be a pirate. Seems like the pirates would be glad if the Navy got what they were looking for and went back up north."`
	"CN-2150" `	Brother Greg nods. "It's worth a try. Why don't you join us for dinner, and we'll depart for Greenrock in the morning. When we get there, just hail the planet and let me do the talking, and I can probably get permission to land for free."`
	"CN-2151" `	You join the brothers for a simple but delicious dinner, soup and salad made entirely from their own gardens. After dinner, Greg asks you, "Do you want to join us for evening prayer?"`
	"CN-2152" `	"Sure, I'd be glad to."`
	"CN-2153" `	"Sorry, I've got some other stuff to get done tonight."`
	"CN-2154" `	"No problem," he says. "See you in the morning."`
	"CN-2155" `	"Evening prayer" turns out to be a lengthy church service that apparently begins with the monks listing every bad thing they can possibly imagine and praying that it would not happen: "From lightning and tempest; from earthquake, fire, and flood; from plague, pestilence, and famine, good Lord, deliver us. From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, murder, and war; and from dying suddenly and unprepared, good Lord, deliver us..." It's very monotonous.`
	"CN-2156" `	At some point, they switch to praying for different people: for the Parliament of the Republic, and everyone in authority; for the governor of <origin>, their world; for the Quarg and all sentient species; for prisoners, for the homeless and poor, for orphans, for pregnant women and young children, for travelers, for starship crews and captains, for miners and oil crews, for mill and factory workers; for the abused; for the mentally ill; for pirates and street gangs; for all creatures and planets vulnerable to exploitation or ecological destruction. (Eyes, who is sitting next to you, responds to that last petition with a fervent "Amen!") The litany is so detailed and specific that you find it both exhausting and fascinating.`
	"CN-2157" `	When the service ends, the monks depart for their rooms in silence, and Eyes, with a brief nod to you, does the same.`
	"CN-2158" `	At breakfast in the monastery, Mr. Eyes tells you, "I'm going to be staying here until you get back. Greenrock is no place for a man with a price on his head. But Katya will be going with you." You bring Katya and Greg back to your ship and get ready to take off.`
	"CN-2159" `Brother Greg disappears for several hours to talk with his various contacts, then returns and reports to you and Katya. "No one has heard anything specific," he says, "and they say keeping a nuclear program secret would take an incredible amount of resources, or a very remote location with very good security."`
	"CN-2160" `	"Any hints on where we should look?" asks Katya.`
	"CN-2161" `	"A few. I talked to one friend who had done research into nuclear development 'for purely academic reasons,' and he said that only a fool would perform atmospheric tests; Intelligence would notice that immediately, no matter what world you were on. He said the ideal development location would be a sparsely populated planet with some abandoned deep underground mines."`
	"CN-2162" `	"Anything else?" you ask.`
	"CN-2163" `	"Just one more thing," says Greg. "Several people mentioned that they think the Navy itself may have a nuclear arsenal, and that a renegade may have stolen the weapons from them. Much easier than developing them yourself."`
	"CN-2164" `	"Well, let's head back to <planet> and see what Eyes thinks," says Katya, "but I can't imagine the Navy would have such an arsenal. Searching on mining planets sounds like our best bet for now."`
	"CN-2165" `When you land on <planet>, as Brother Greg is gathering his luggage, Katya hands you another credit chip for <payment>. "Thanks for risking your life with the pirates," she says. "You've got real guts."`
	"CN-2166" `	You return to the monastery and share your new information with Mr. Eyes. His reaction is the same as Katya's. "No way the Navy has nukes," he says. "Some other secret branch of the government, maybe, but not the Navy. That would offend their sense of honor."`
	"CN-2167" `	"Still," says Katya, "if there was such a program and the weapons were stolen from it, that would explain why Intelligence has not named a suspect yet. They would have to reveal the program's existence."`
	"CN-2168" `	Eyes shakes his head. "This isn't a productive line of investigation," he says. "If it was some local terrorists, we've got some hope of tracking them down. If it's some shadowy government organization, there's no way we can find them. So, the local terrorist angle is the only one worth pursuing."`
	"CN-2169" `	"Very well," says Katya. "Captain <last>, meet us in the spaceport if you're willing to continue working with us."`
	"CN-2170" `You find Katya and Mr. Eyes sitting at a table in the corner of a small cafe, talking in hushed voices and examining a galactic map that is spread out in front of them. Several of the nearby systems are circled. Katya says, "Hello again, Captain. We've picked three planets that we think are our best options: <planet>, Hopper, and New Iceland. It should only take a few weeks to visit all of them. What do you say?"`
	"CN-2171" `	"Sure, I definitely want to help solve this case!"`
	"CN-2172" `	"Why these worlds specifically? Why not check worlds in Free space if the Republic thinks you did it?"`
	"CN-2173" `	"I'm through with helping the Free Worlds. I don't think we have a chance of beating the Navy to the punch."`
	"CN-2174" `	"I suppose that showing a lack of evidence for nuclear testing done on Free planets would be circumstantial evidence for us," Eyes says, "but we're specifically hunting for the culprit, so these are our best bets as far as nearby mining worlds go. And searching these three worlds would be quicker than searching all of Free space."`
	"CN-2175" `	"Another thing we have to keep in mind is that we may not be able to operate outside of Free space forever," Katya responds. "I pray that we find answers before it comes to it, but war between the Free Worlds and Republic would cut us off from freely searching most of the galaxy."`
	"CN-2176" `	"Okay, I'll help you search these worlds."`
	"CN-2177" `	"I don't think this is the best course of action. You'll have to find someone else to help you with this."`
	"CN-2178" `	"Great!" says Katya. "We'll stop on <destination> first, then swing by Hopper and on to New Iceland. If we still haven't found anything by that point, we'll start working our way up the Rim."`
	"CN-2179" `Mr. Eyes fires up his instruments and looks at the results for a few minutes. "Nothing," he says. "Even underground testing would've thrown up a debris plume large enough to measure traces of it. But I'm picking up nothing."`
	"CN-2180" `	"No problem," says Katya. "Let's continue to <planet>."`
	"CN-2181" `Again, Eyes runs his tests, and again, nothing shows up. "One more planet to go," he says. "Time to try <planet>." You can tell that they are both starting to feel a bit discouraged, and you are overwhelmed by the thought of how many planets in this sector you may need to search unless you get a lucky break soon.`
	"CN-2182" `<origin> turns out no differently than the previous two. "We need a change in strategy," says Katya. "We've been talking about something while we were in transit."`
	"CN-2183" `	Eyes says, "It occurred to me that underwater testing might be even easier than underground: no need to dig or find a mine shaft. And, the Navy's sensors are for atmosphere, not oceans. But I've still got my old test kits with me for seawater."`
	"CN-2184" `	Katya says, "So then we wondered, what sort of world would you go to if you wanted rumblings in the ocean to go unnoticed? Either an unpopulated one, or one with lots of meteorite activity. And that leads us to... <planet>." She points out the system on your map. "Mild tidal surges on almost a weekly basis, due to impacts from all the asteroids in system. Perfect place to hide an undersea explosion."`
	"CN-2185" `	"Sounds like a good possibility. Let's give it a try!"`
	"CN-2186" `	"But <planet> is part of the Free Worlds. What happens if we do find evidence there?"`
	"CN-2187" `	"I've got other missions I need to run instead of continuing this wild goose chase."`
	"CN-2188" `	"The plan hasn't changed," Eyes responds. "We find where the testing occurred, and that will lead us to the culprits. Even if it turns out that someone connected to the Free Worlds are responsible, they'll be turned over to the Republic."`
	"CN-2189" `	"I pray that no one within the Free Worlds are a part of this, though," Katya says quietly. "I'm almost hoping we find nothing."`
	"CN-2190" `	"Fair enough. Let's give it a try."`
	"CN-2191" `	"The Free Worlds are looking guiltier the more we look. I'm out of here."`
	"CN-2192" `	"I appreciate your help, Captain <last>," says Katya. "Let's get going."`
	"CN-2193" `After landing, you go for a walk along the beach with Katya and Eyes. They both go barefoot, walking in the surf. Eyes is collecting pebbles and shells from under the water, and at one point instead of grabbing a pebble he surreptitiously reaches down and fills a small vial with seawater.`
	"CN-2194" `	Back at your ship he runs his tests, with you and Katya watching eagerly. He looks at the results, frowns, and then repeats the whole procedure with a second test kit. Finally he sighs. "Nothing," he says.`
	"CN-2195" `	Katya shouts in frustration and bangs her fists against the bulkheads. "We're never going to find anything," she says. "Forget it, I'm going for a walk." She leaves your ship.`
	"CN-2196" `	Mr. Eyes packs up his instruments, and then you walk outside and find her sitting on the landing pad near your ship, watching the moon rise over the ocean. She seems much calmer.`
	"CN-2197" `	(Sit down next to her and try to comfort her.)`
	"CN-2198" `	"What should we do now?"`
	"CN-2199" `	You sit on one side of her, and Eyes sits on the other. "It's really admirable, what you're doing," you say. "You're trying to work for peace, and for justice. It's valuable work. Don't lose heart."`
	"CN-2200" `	"One more try," she says. "One last world, and then we give up. I want you to take me... there." She points at the moon, hanging just above the horizon.`
	"CN-2201" `	Eyes says, "Mining world. Dusty atmosphere. Frequent meteorite impacts. You could set off a nuke on the far side of that world and the miners would probably sleep right through it."`
	"CN-2202" `	"Okay, I'll take you to this one last world, and then we're done."`
	"CN-2203" `	"Sorry, 'one more world' is what you said two planets ago. I'm done with this."`
	"CN-2204" `	"I promise it will be the last one," says Katya.`
	"CN-2205" `You land some distance from the mining settlement, and Mr. Eyes goes into the airlock in a pressure suit, cycling it to bring in some of the moon's thin atmosphere for him to test. "Firing up my instruments now," he says through the commlink. There is a long pause, and then he starts spouting a long string of creative profanity. Katya runs over to the airlock window to see what is happening.`
	"CN-2206" `	Finally, Eyes calms down enough to say, "It's a match! Not only has there been a recent test here, but the signature matches the one we took on Geminus. This is it."`
	"CN-2207" `	He cycles the airlock and comes back inside. "Let's fly around and see if we can find the site," he says. After a few hours of flying low over the surface and scanning for radiation signatures, you find a spot that looks like all the other meteorite craters but is full of radiation. Katya and Eyes look at the images of the surface almost in disbelief.`
	"CN-2208" `	"Based on the isotopic decay rates, this explosion happened in mid-June," says Eyes. "Just before the attacks happened."`
	"CN-2209" `	"It makes no sense," says Katya. "It's a blatant atmospheric test. No way the Navy hasn't found this. The Navy could act on this at any moment."`
	"CN-2210" `	"What do we do now that we've found the test site?"`
	"CN-2211" `	"So the Free Worlds are behind this! This is one of your planets!"`
	"CN-2212" `	"Yes, this a Free planet, but this evidence is far too blatant," Eyes responds. "Just because we found a match here doesn't mean this is where all the testing happened. I'm only detecting enough isotopes to account for one explosion, and you wouldn't just test once. If anything, this shows that the Free Worlds are being framed by someone, and they used one nuke here before bombing Geminus and Martini to make it look like it was the Free Worlds who did it."`
	"CN-2213" `	"I swear before God when I say that the Free Worlds have nothing to do with this, Captain," Katya says. "But we'll find whoever is responsible and bring them to justice."`
	"CN-2214" `	Katya thinks for a moment. "Captain, is the outpost reporting any job openings?"`
	"CN-2215" `	You check your computer. "One job opening, for a janitor in the mess hall."`
	"CN-2216" `	She grimaces. "Okay, it's better than nothing. I'll take the job to go undercover and see what I can find out. You take Eyes to <planet>, where he can get in touch with the Free Worlds Council. I'll find a way to send you a message once I've found the perpetrators."`
	"CN-2217" `	"Katerina," says Eyes, "this is way too dangerous. As I said, if we were able to detect this then so can the Navy, and they probably already have. They could decide to occupy Clink at any moment, and you'd be trapped here with no way out."`
	"CN-2218" `	"There's no other way," she says. "We have no time to lose. I'm willing to risk it."`
	"CN-2219" `	With deep reservations, you drop her off at the outpost. Katya ruffles her hair and rubs some moon dust onto her face to blend in while asking about the job, which she is quickly offered. "Not many folks care to work up here," says the foreman, "so your help would be much appreciated." You and Eyes return to your ship and get ready to travel to <planet> with the evidence.`
	"CN-2220" `Eyes has been really quiet for the whole journey; you're sure that he's worried about Katya. When you land, he hands you <payment> and says, "Thank you for all your help, Captain. I pray that this leads to justice being done."`
	"CN-2221" `	He starts to walk off, then comes back. "By the way, Katya wanted to keep this a secret, but I think you should know." He points to the credit chips he just handed you. "Katya's been funding this out of her own pocket. That's the last of her savings that she just paid you."`
	"CN-2222" `	"I had no idea."`
	"CN-2223" `	"Wow, she really is dedicated to this work, isn't she?"`
	"CN-2224" `	"She's a unique woman," says Eyes. "I hope we see her again soon. Goodbye for now, <first>."`
	"CN-2225" `Soon after you land, a courier arrives at your ship and hands you a formal looking letter. It reads:`
	"CN-2226" `Dear Captain <last>,`
	"CN-2227" `	The Free Worlds Council would like to thank you for the invaluable assistance you have rendered to us recently. We are prepared to offer you a position as an officer in our militia, remaining in command of your own ship. Your starting salary will be 1,100 credits per diem. If you want to join us, please report to our headquarters on Bourne at your earliest convenience.`
	"CN-2228" `	Sincerely,`
	"CN-2229" `				Tomek Voigt`
	"CN-2230" `				Jean-Jacques Soleau`
	"CN-2231" `				Freya Winters`
	"CN-2232" `				Alondo Gruyere`
	"CN-2233" `				Katerina Reynolds`
	"CN-2234" `	You notice that Katya's name is printed, instead of signed like the others; she must still be undercover on Clink.`
	"CN-2235" `You are on Bourne, the capital of the Free Worlds. Do you take them up on their job offer and volunteer to officially join them? With tensions between the Free Worlds and Republic so high, it's not unthinkable that they could go to war with one another, so it would be a good idea to have a warship and some spare funds before siding with the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-2236" `	(Yes.)`
	"CN-2237" `	(Not yet.)`
	"CN-2238" `	You find the Free Worlds offices and give your name to the person at the front desk. A few minutes later Tomek Voigt, who manages supplies and fleet movements for the Council, comes down the stairs to greet you. "I'm so glad you've agreed to join us, Captain <last>," he says.`
	"CN-2239" `	You find the Free Worlds offices and give your name to the person at the front desk. A few minutes later Tomek Voigt, who manages supplies and fleet movements for the Council, comes down the stairs to greet you. "Captain <last>," he says with a stern glare. "If it were up to me alone you would not be standing in front of me today, but it would appear that your continued help has earned you enough good will to surpass my mistrust of you.`
	"CN-2240" `	"But I'm a reasonable man," he continues, his expression changing to a smile. "If my friends trust you, then I will give you a second chance, even if it is against my better judgment. Now please, join us."`
	"CN-2241" `	That night you are introduced to the rest of the Council: Alondo Gruyere, the Council's chief diplomat, Freya Winters, an adept engineer and the Council's head of logistics, and Jean-Jacques "JJ" Soleau, an ex-Navy officer who now leads the training of the Free Worlds militias. Katya Reynolds, the final member of the Council, is not present.`
	"CN-2242" `	They take you out to dinner at a very fancy restaurant. Halfway through the third course of the meal, Tomek's communicator beeps. He reaches over to turn it off, then sees the message and turns pale. A hush falls over the table. "<system> has been captured by the Navy," he announces.`
	"CN-2243" `	After a long silence, JJ asks, "How many casualties?"`
	"CN-2244" `	"None," says Tomek. "The Navy claimed that <system> was the source of the terrorist attack, and after they showed the evidence to the militia commander on Deep he surrendered and yielded control of the system to them without a fight."`
	"CN-2245" `	"Was Katya still there? We need to rescue her!"`
	"CN-2246" `	"We can't allow them to do that. We should gather our fleets and attack."`
	"CN-2247" `	"Indeed," says Freya. "That should be our first priority."`
	"CN-2248" `	JJ says, "Calm down, Captain. Combat is our last option, not our first. And if their claim is correct, they were justified in taking the system."`
	"CN-2249" `	Freya says, "Uniting the militias could take weeks. A much more pressing issue is that Katya is still on Clink, unless anyone has heard otherwise from her."`
	"CN-2250" `	"Well," says Alondo, "it's a good thing we haven't yet publicly announced that Captain <last> is working for us. Captain, we have one final mission for you as an independent merchant captain. We need you to stop on Clink, locate Katya, and bring her safely to Longjump without being stopped by the Navy."`
	"CN-2251" `The mining outpost on Clink is swarming with Navy officers; you would guess that they in fact outnumber the miners. You are not sure how you are going to get in there and contact Katya without the Navy noticing.`
	"CN-2252" `	(Wait in my ship and see if she approaches.)`
	"CN-2253" `	(Check if she is waiting for me out by the test site.)`
	"CN-2254" `	(Make some excuse to enter the outpost.)`
	"CN-2255" `	You wait on the landing pad for several hours. Katya does not show up. Navy officers in pressure suits walk by your ship about every fifteen minutes, no doubt wondering what you are doing here.`
	"CN-2256" `	(Give up and report my failure to the Council.)`
	"CN-2257" `	You fly over the test site scanning for life signs or energy signatures, but there is nothing. And, there is little chance that Katya could be living out here for long, because she would need an oxygen source.`
	"CN-2258" `	(Wait on the landing pad and see if she approaches.)`
	"CN-2259" `	You put on a pressure suit, leave your ship, and approach the outpost. As soon as you step through the airlock you are stopped by a Navy officer. "What is your business here?" he asks.`
	"CN-2260" `	"My brother is a miner here," you say. "Our mother sent me to check on him."`
	"CN-2261" `	The officer says, "Don't worry, no one here has been hurt, and they will all be free to continue their work shortly. But for now, I'm going to have to ask you to leave this world." He calls over several guards who are wearing pressure suits; they escort you to your ship and command you to take off.`
	"CN-2262" `	You have no choice but to head back to <planet> without Katya. The Council is going to be very disappointed.`
	"CN-2263" `When you land on <planet>, you discover that Tomek has already found transportation here; he meets you almost as soon as your ship lands. When you step out of the hatch alone, without Katya, he turns away in grief. "I'm sorry," you say, "I couldn't locate her. The whole place is under guard."`
	"CN-2264" `	"Very well," he says, "we'll have to pray that she's still hidden there somewhere. In the meantime, we need to make your allegiance official so that you can fight alongside us if it comes to that."`
	"CN-2265" `	He is carrying a paintbrush and a very large can of green paint. "Would you like to do the honors?" he asks.`
	"CN-2266" `	"I can't just keep flying merchant colors?"`
	"CN-2267" `	"No," he says, "it would be dishonest, and if you were to fight alongside us you would be classified as a partisan, a criminal rather than an enemy combatant. Believe it or not, you're better off as an official prisoner of war than as a partisan, if you ever do get captured. So, time to start painting."`
	"CN-2268" `	You take the paintbrush, climb on top of your ship, and begin painting it in the green and gold of the Free Worlds. Suddenly you hear a cheer from one of the other ships parked nearby; someone has seen what you are doing and is shouting, "For freedom! Another ship for freedom!" Soon several other people see you, and before long it seems like everyone in the port has picked up the cheer.`
	"CN-2269" `	Tomek stands by, silently, until you finish, and then approaches you with an outstretched arm holding onto a license. "Here. You're going to need this. I'm sure your assistance will be invaluable to our cause," he says as you accept the militia license. "Now if you'll excuse me, I must gather the militia for the coming battle."`
	"CN-2270" `	(Let him go.)`
	"CN-2271" `	"I've never worked with another fleet in battle, what advice can you offer?"`
	"CN-2272" `	He stops his turn to leave. "Of course, you probably haven't spent much time in a militia fleet defending a planet or system." After a few moments of thought, he continues, "When fighting alongside a large fleet, it's usually best to work in groups, fire on the same targets as everyone else. You'll see the ships around you working together to disable a single target at a time, instead of everyone trying to run their own one-on-one fights. We don't expect you to defeat every Navy ship yourself. And, try not to get too close to their ships, either; you probably don't want a group all choosing to target you." He pauses for a moment. "Though, if you're feeling brave, you could try to get a large group of ships to follow you and lead them on a wild goose chase, leaving a smaller force for everyone else to deal with before moving on to your group. It'll be a short chase, however, if you can't stay out of their weapon range and evade their missiles. If it comes to defending this system in particular, the Navy may send additional ships after the initial wave. They will most likely arrive from Kornephoros, so being in their line of fire, on that side of the system, before they arrive is also something to avoid.`
	"CN-2273" `	"Now, I really do need to go get everyone else ready."`
	"CN-2274" `	You find that the militia are collecting at the spaceport bar. Some congratulate you on joining the Free Worlds, but most are standing around quietly, waiting for something to happen. More gather as time goes by, to the point that the bar becomes overcrowded and militia are waiting in the streets outside the building.`
	"CN-2275" `	An hour later, while standing outside the bar, you look up and notice the flashing lights of ship weapons fire off in the distance above the planet. Some militia begin running to their ships, but most stand there like a deer in headlights. Just then, Tomek returns with a megaphone and begins shouting orders. "The Navy has entered the system! We can't let them take it, or they'll have us completely bottled up. This is where it begins. We need to fight! Get to your ships, quickly! We have more reinforcements on their way from deeper in the Rim!`
	"CN-2276" `	"And if you can, disable their ships instead of destroying them. These are Navy ships, after all, and most of them don't want war any more than we do. Now go! Your worlds need you!" You hurry to join all the other ships taking off to defend the system.`
	"CN-2277" `The mood in the spaceport is solemn. No one has had time yet to count up the losses, on both sides of the battle, but it is likely that over a thousand lives were lost. And because the Navy is held in such high regard even here where Parliament and the Paradise Planets are viewed with disgust, many of the militia captains are almost as saddened by the loss of Navy lives as by the loss of some of their own.`
	"CN-2278" `	You find Tomek walking among the fleet, conversing with a large group of captains and crew members and assessing the damage they have suffered. When he sees you he says, "Captain <last>! How is <ship> holding together?"`
	"CN-2279" `	"She took a bit of a pounding, but I've patched her up."`
	"CN-2280" `	"Just fine. It'd take more than a few Carriers to destroy the <ship>."`
	"CN-2281" `	"Glad to hear it," he says before returning to the crowd. "Listen! We need to press our advantage before the Republic has time to call for reinforcements. If we strike quickly, we could be able to retake Kornephoros from them. It's important to break the blockade on that system for the sake of trade with the rest of the galaxy. And on top of that, if you were not aware, Councilor Katya Reynolds was on Clink when the Navy took the system and needs to be rescued." You hear some chatter coming from the crowd as a result of this news; it seems like Katya's investigation on Clink was not public knowledge.`
	"CN-2282" `	"We have a large fleet of reinforcements coming in from the Rim," Tomek continues, "and a few ships here that are able to fight another battle. I need you all to take off, wait for the reinforcements to arrive, and then retake Kornephoros. If the Navy ships retreat, let them retreat. If they surrender, let them surrender. If they stay and fight, disable them if you can. Destroy them only if you must. Am I understood?"`
	"CN-2283" `	"Yes sir!" the captains respond in unison.`
	"CN-2284" `	"Then move out!" Tomek yells, prompting the captains and crew to scramble for their ships.`
	"CN-2285" `	Tomek returns to you after rousing the militia to action. "Still in this fight with us?"`
	"CN-2286" `	"Yes, sir. I'll move out immediately."`
	"CN-2287" `	"I wish it hadn't come to this."`
	"CN-2288" `	"We all do," he says. "No one wanted this. Not us, certainly not the Navy. But if they attack us to take our freedom, we must defend ourselves in order to keep it. Understood?"`
	"CN-2289" `	"Yes, sir. I'll prepare my ship for another battle."`
	"CN-2290" `The last of the Navy vessels in orbit has been subdued. As you land, you find that several Free Worlds troop transports have already set down in the spaceport and corralled the remaining Navy officers into a small circle. You would estimate that there are several hundred Navy prisoners. Another transport lands, carrying more prisoners: the Navy troops who had been guarding the mines on Clink.`
	"CN-2291" `	For several hours, nothing changes: the Navy troops are huddled into a small circle, surrounded by guards. When lunchtime comes, some of the guards go to the market and fetch some of the vendors who sell meals out of carts there; they return with the carts and hand out food to the prisoners. Then, another transport lands and Tomek steps out.`
	"CN-2292" `	He pulls you aside and asks you, "How are things going here?"`
	"CN-2293" `	"Very quiet. They haven't given us any trouble."`
	"CN-2294" `	"The battle was brutal. I hope we don't have to keep doing that."`
	"CN-2295" `	"Glad to hear it," he says.`
	"CN-2296" `	"I hope so too," he says. "Maybe we can make a start in that direction right now."`
	"CN-2297" `	Tomek climbs up onto the hull of a nearby ship and addresses the prisoners. "Hello," he says. A few of the Navy officers respond, warily. "My name is Tomek Voigt. Our militia is very loosely organized, but I'm the one in charge of organizing it." That gets a few laughs from the Free Worlds guards. "As such, I am responsible for deciding your fate."`
	"CN-2298" `	At that, a hush falls over the crowd. "The Council has decided," he continues, "that any of you who gives us your parole, swearing to take no further part in fighting the Free Worlds, will be returned to Republic space. You will give us your word of honor that you will either seek reassignment in another part of the galaxy, or resign your commission."`
	"CN-2299" `	A few of the Free Worlds guards shout, "What?" But only a surprising few. The rest are nodding, seemingly pleased with the Council's choice. Tomek climbs down from the hull and approaches the prisoners, and you notice Alondo and Freya have joined him.`
	"CN-2300" `	One of the Navy officers stands up. "I'll take that oath," he says, "if you'll honor your part of it."`
	"CN-2301" `	Tomek takes the man's hands, looks him in the eyes, and asks, "Do you swear before God and these witnesses to take no further part in military actions against the Free Worlds?"`
	"CN-2302" `	"I do," says the officer. Several of the other prisoners stand up, and before long all but a handful have sworn the oath.`
	"CN-2303" `	After they finish, Tomek turns to you and a few other captains. "Emily, Marco, <first>, Sarah, please meet me in the spaceport cafe when you are ready." He walks off.`
	"CN-2304" `When you have all gathered in the cafe, Tomek explains the situation to you. "Alondo has arranged for a one-week ceasefire to return the prisoners who have given us their parole," he says. "That gives you just enough time to transport them to New Tibet and return here. If you encounter Republic ships, do not engage them. Just drop off the prisoners and return. Any questions?"`
	"CN-2305" `	"No, I'm ready to go."`
	"CN-2306" `	"What should we do if they attack us?"`
	"CN-2307" `	"What will be done with the soldiers who didn't swear the oath?"`
	"CN-2308" `	"If you can, return here without engaging them. No point in losing more lives. Besides, the Navy are honorable and will respect the ceasefire, I have no doubt about that. Only if you linger will things become difficult for you. Now get going. Time is limited."`
	"CN-2309" `	"They will be transported to a penal facility on Bourne and cared for well, and if at any point they change their minds, they will be allowed to leave. Now get going. Time is limited."`
	"CN-2310" `Tomek seems very relieved to see you all back in one piece. "Thank you for your service," he says. "Please report to your local militia commanders for your next orders. Captain <last>, remain here."`
	"CN-2311" `	After everyone else has left the room, he tells you, "I'm sorry, but I've got some bad news for you. We've searched the entire outpost on Clink. No sign of Katya. The miners don't know what happened to her, but I'd say it's a safe bet that she's either dead, or a prisoner."`
	"CN-2312" `	"So, what do we do now?"`
	"CN-2313" `	"I wish we'd known that a few days earlier. We could have arranged a prisoner exchange."`
	"CN-2314" `	"I know," he says. "That's what a lot of our people are saying now. But what we did, a pure good-faith gesture with nothing demanded in return - we may come to be glad of that. My hope was to set a precedent, to shape the character of whatever conflict comes out of this, and I still think that was the right thing to do."`
	"CN-2315" `	"So, what do we do now?" you ask.`
	"CN-2316" `	"The Navy has had two crushing defeats," he says. "They will be hesitant to attack again until their numbers are much stronger. That gives us some time for diplomacy, to strengthen our position, and to look for allies, or at least sympathizers. Which is where you come in. I'm going to ask you to transport Alondo for a set of diplomatic missions. Meet us in the spaceport when you are ready."`
	"CN-2317" `When you land on <origin>, it seems that everyone in the spaceport is talking about a recent news story: the Navy has just announced the formation of a new regiment, called the Oathkeepers. This regiment is staffed mostly by prisoners you paroled from Kornephoros, who want to honor their oath to take no further part in the conflict against the Free Worlds. They will be headquartered on Farpoint, in the far north, to defend that region of space against pirate incursions.`
	"CN-2318" `	Furthermore, the leader of the Oathkeepers will be Admiral Danforth, an elderly admiral who is something of a folk hero and is spoken of with admiration and respect even here in Free space. Although he was not one of the paroled prisoners, he has become an outspoken advocate for a diplomatic solution to the Free Worlds conflict.`
	"CN-2319" `	It's heartening news, but you also can't help noticing how many people in the spaceport are talking now about how the Navy really is full of "decent" and "honorable" people, and it's a shame that the Free Worlds had to fight them. By responding to your generous gesture with one of their own, the Navy has won a definite political victory, and given that they needed to defend the North anyway, it is a victory that cost them very little.`
	"CN-2320" `You meet Tomek and Alondo in the spaceport. "We've decided that now would be a good time for diplomatic missions," says Alondo. "We've proven that we are a force to reckon with, but also that we are open to working for peace. We'll start with the Syndicate, as a relationship with them would be a significant advantage for us."`
	"CN-2321" `	"Do you think they will fight on our side?"`
	"CN-2322" `	"Wait, isn't the Syndicate an evil megacorporation?"`
	"CN-2323" `	"Certainly not," says Alondo. "Unlike us, the Syndicate has few grievances with the Republic. While the Navy does not patrol the Core, the Syndicate funds their own private security for the region. I don't see what they'd gain from joining the fight on our side. But they are very interested in maximizing their profits, so I pray we can arrange to purchase ship materials from them. And if nothing else, I pray they at least will promise not to hire out their security forces as mercenaries to the Republic."`
	"CN-2324" `	"Well, they do have a long record of environmental and human rights violations. But they are also the single largest employer in the galaxy, and a main reason for the stability the Republic has enjoyed for the last few centuries. The Syndicate is also not a monolith. There are at least some good people within the Syndicate. I... used to know one," Alondo says with some apprehension. "So, I wouldn't call the Syndicate 'evil.' It's more complicated than that."`
	"CN-2325" `	"Reaching Syndicate space could be difficult once the Navy has time to regroup," says Tomek. "This may be the last window of opportunity we get for a while to meet with them in person."`
	"CN-2326" `	"I have plenty of contacts in the Dirt Belt," says Alondo, "so if a planet won't let us land, we can just hail them and I should be able to negotiate with them. In fact, I'm hoping that a side effect of this trip will be to judge how much sympathy we have in the surrounding systems."`
	"CN-2327" `	"Sounds good! Let's do it!"`
	"CN-2328" `	"Why meet in person? How do we know this isn't a trap?"`
	"CN-2329" `	"What should we do if we encounter Navy ships?"`
	"CN-2330" `	"While data moves through the hyperspace network faster than ships, having any substantial back and forth would take longer than if we simply showed up in person. The Syndicate is also often driven by greed, and we're worth more as customers of the Syndicate than as prisoners of the Republic. If nothing else, showing up in person is a sign of good faith. It puts our trust in the Syndicate, trust that they'd be unlikely to betray given the risk they'd see us taking simply to meet with them."`
	"CN-2331" `	"I hope you're right! Let's get going."`
	"CN-2332" `	"I would suggest evading them," Alondo says. "From a diplomatic perspective, I'd rather let them live, but Tomek might think otherwise."`
	"CN-2333" `	"No," Tomek responds. "I agree. Just as you say there are good people within the Syndicate, there are good people within the Navy as well. It's one thing to fight during a battle, but we're not looking to invade Republic territory, only pass through it. Save your energy and only defend yourself if you must."`
	"CN-2334" `	"Okay. Let's get going!"`
	"CN-2335" `As you land, Alondo says to you, "Let me do the talking, please." You are met almost immediately by two men in suits, who escort you to a room in the Syndicate headquarters. Six men are sitting on one side of a large mahogany conference table; they gesture for the two of you to be seated on the other side.`
	"CN-2336" `	You introduce yourselves. "Thank you for meeting with us," says Alondo.`
	"CN-2337" `	A man who appears much younger than the others introduces himself as Samuel Remington and responds. "Hearing that representatives of the Free Worlds were on their way was certainly a surprise. I apologize that CEO Korban could not meet with us today. He sent me in his stead to ensure that this meeting was handled with the utmost delicacy. So, what might it be that brings you here?"`
	"CN-2338" `	"We would like to secure the purchase of construction materials for new ships," says Alondo. "As well as ask that the Syndicate refrains from joining the war as mercenaries. Our grievance is with the Republic, not the Syndicate."`
	"CN-2339" `	"We are always open to new business opportunities," says another man, Lopez, "although negotiating with known terrorists is... distasteful." He leafs through a folder of papers, pulls one out, and slides it over to you. It is a picture of Katya, and the caption under it reads, "Terrorist ringleader captured in raid on Kornephoros system." It is dated a few days after the Navy's initial assault, before you retook the system from them.`
	"CN-2340" `	(Let Alondo handle this.)`
	"CN-2341" `	(Try to explain what Katya was doing in that system.)`
	"CN-2342" `	Alondo has turned very pale, but finally he says, "They have not announced this publicly."`
	"CN-2343" `	"No," says Lopez, "they have only shared it with certain... trusted friends of the Republic."`
	"CN-2344" `	Alondo says, "They haven't announced anything because they know she was innocent. She was hunting the terrorists, not helping them."`
	"CN-2345" `	"She was there trying to find the terrorists. She wasn't one of them," you say.`
	"CN-2346" `	Alondo side eyes you, looking very pale.`
	"CN-2347" `	"That may be true," says a third man, Badenoch. "I am willing to believe you were hunting the terrorists, because I am aware through my own sources that the Free Worlds secured the services of a certain Ijs Springborn, whose skills would be well suited to such a hunt. And who might not be in as safe a position today if you had not given him a reason to leave this sector of space, where he is... universally despised. Regardless, we cannot sell supplies to enemies of the Republic."`
	"CN-2348" `	"Piracy is on the rise in the Dirt Belt," says Alondo. "And I know you have customers there. Such as the Tarazed Corporation. If we can count you among our friends, we could ensure that your convoys reach Tarazed unmolested."`
	"CN-2349" `	"And you would no doubt immediately purchase said supplies from Tarazed," says Badenoch.`
	"CN-2350" `	A much older man sitting next to him, Akihito, says, "Of course, such weapons would end up being bought at a significant price markup." He is grinning.`
	"CN-2351" `	"No," Remington says, surprising some of the other men at the table. "No markups necessary." None of the other men argue with Remington over this.`
	"CN-2352" `	You speak for a while longer, but Alondo manages to hash out a deal where the Free Worlds will defend any Syndicate ships they encounter within the Dirt Belt in return for a promise that the Syndicate will not serve as Republic mercenaries and will not prevent you from purchasing their equipment indirectly through Tarazed. In addition, Remington suggested that you might find some "extra goodies" among the Syndicate convoys heading to Tarazed specifically. You thank the Syndicate leaders, and begin the trip back to your ship.`
	"CN-2353" `	Alondo is silent. As you're about to leave the spaceport for the landing pads, you hear someone shout behind you. "No need to be a stranger, Gruyere. Can't stick around for a drink?" You turn to look at who it is, but Alondo keeps walking. You find Samuel Remington approaching, paying you no mind. "Are you still mad at me, Gruyere?" he asks.`
	"CN-2354" `	(Stand in Remington's way.)`
	"CN-2355" `	(Don't engage.)`
	"CN-2356" `	Remington stops a few paces past you as Alondo boards your ship. Remington shakes his head before looking back to you. "I guess a guy can't talk to an old friend."`
	"CN-2357" `	You take a step into Remington's path as Alondo boards your ship. Remington stops face-to-face with you. "What, a guy can't talk to an old friend?" he says while looking over your shoulder.`
	"CN-2358" `	"He's clearly not interested."`
	"CN-2359" `	"You know Alondo?"`
	"CN-2360" `	"More than most," Remington says with a chuckle. "He was never one to show gratitude for gifts. I hope you enjoy the new toys in those shipments I just secured more than he does."`
	"CN-2361" `	"As if that's ever stopped me before," Remington says with a chuckle. "He was never one to show gratitude for gifts. I hope you enjoy the new toys in those shipments I just secured more than he does."`
	"CN-2362" `	"What new toys?" you ask.`
	"CN-2363" `	"You'll see," he says, turning back to the spaceport and leaving you.`
	"CN-2364" `	You join Alondo on your ship and find him solemnly staring out a window.`
	"CN-2365" `	"It seems like the negotiations went pretty well."`
	"CN-2366" `	"What was that all about?"`
	"CN-2367" `	"What do we do about Katya?"`
	"CN-2368" `	"Samuel and I have... a history. One I'd rather not discuss," Alondo responds. "Anyway, we must continue with our mission. Time for us to make a visit to Tarazed. Let's get going."`
	"CN-2369" `	"They did. Although it feels like it was almost too easy. Support from Samuel isn't too unexpected, but I'd have expected the others to fight him over squeezing us a bit more." Alondo pauses for a moment. "Anyway, we must continue with our mission. Time for us to make a visit to Tarazed."`
	"CN-2370" `	"I'll have to talk that over with the Council when we get back. But if she is a prisoner of the Intelligence Bureau, there is no way we can rescue her. Her only hope is that they will recognize her innocence. For now, we must continue with our mission. Time for us to make a visit to Tarazed."`
	"CN-2371" `When you arrive at <origin>, you find that there are already some Syndicate ships here unloading cargo that must have been sent ahead of you. You catch a glimpse of some of the crates and see large amounts of ship materials, as well as crates of blasters, Proton Guns, and other Syndicate products.`
	"CN-2372" `	Upon contacting the Tarazed Corporation, you and Alondo are led into the Tarazed board room, which is different from the Syndicate one in two respects. First, it is much less fancy. And second, there are women present: unlike the notoriously misogynistic Syndicate, Tarazed is currently run by a female CEO, Emily Lane.`
	"CN-2373" `	"I'm pleased to welcome you here," says Emily. "It's nice to finally speak with you directly, Alondo. Many of us are sympathetic to your cause."`
	"CN-2374" `	"Thank you," says Alondo, "although for the time being the best way to support us may be for you to remain neutral in this conflict." He explains the negotiations with the Syndicate and the idea of Tarazed being a go-between for Syndicate supplies.`
	"CN-2375" `	"I don't like dealing with the Syndicate," says Emily, "but like yourselves, we could not build ships without the systems they manufacture. Of course, the materials we receive from Free space are equally valuable. But if we remain nominally a part of the Republic, they will have full access to this system, including searching incoming and outgoing freighters."`
	"CN-2376" `	"You receive weapons and ship materials all the time. As long as they don't know it's going to us, they shouldn't care."`
	"CN-2377" `	(Let Alondo do the talking.)`
	"CN-2378" `	"True," says Alondo, "but a Navy fleet here would be vulnerable to being cut off from Republic space, so unless they occupy the whole Dirt Belt, I do not think they would risk it."`
	"CN-2379" `	"Perhaps so," Emily responds. "Although I must ask what sort of strings you pulled to manage what you have. Shortly before you arrived we began receiving Syndicate supplies that we never ordered. Quad Blaster Turrets. Proton guns. Anti-missile turrets. Even atomic thrusters from the Deep, which the Syndicate does not normally sell. Is this all for the Free Worlds?"`
	"CN-2380" `	Alondo pauses. "I have... an old friend within the Syndicate. He was a part of the negotiations, and mentioned that there would be 'extra goodies' within the coming convoys. We haven't been on speaking terms for years, and I suppose this is his attempt to get back on my good side."`
	"CN-2381" `	"I doubt that supplies in these amounts are just an attempt at old friends trying to get back together," says Emily. "The Syndicate does not play games like this without having something to gain from it. I would not think too highly of this gesture."`
	"CN-2382" `	They continue talking for a while, and you leave well convinced that Tarazed is willing to support you and that the best way they can do that for now is by remaining neutral. There were questions raised about the intentions of the Syndicate, though.`
	"CN-2383" `	"Now," says Alondo, "I'd like to make one more diplomatic visit. The planet <planet> has insisted on remaining loyal to the Republic, even though they are deep inside our space. I'd like to meet with their leaders and see if they will reconsider joining us."`
	"CN-2384" `As you are landing on Poisonwood, Alondo explains, "Three decades ago, this was a slave colony. The Navy was responsible for liberating them, and they still feel a deep debt to the Republic as a result. But even if they do not join us, we can maybe establish more friendly relations with them."`
	"CN-2385" `	Soon after you land, the governor of Poisonwood sends an aide to escort you to her office. The governor is probably in her late fifties, and as you are speaking the sunlight occasionally catches her face or arms at exactly the right angle to show the faint, criss-crossing lines of very old scars. She must have been one of the slaves who were freed by the Navy.`
	"CN-2386" `	As soon as you are seated, she says, "Now, I don't want to give you false hope. We will not be joining the Free Worlds."`
	"CN-2387" `	"Understood," says Alondo. "We've come primarily to assure you that the Free Worlds will never attempt to take control of a planet that has not willingly chosen to join us. But without our support, your world is isolated and vulnerable."`
	"CN-2388" `	"Indeed," she says, grimacing. They talk for a while, but it is clear she does not think her people would ever support even a treaty of neutrality with the "rebellion." Finally, she changes the subject. "Captain <last>," she says, "what do you believe is the greatest threat that humanity faces today?"`
	"CN-2389" `	"Corrupt government."`
	"CN-2390" `	"Powerful corporations and unbridled capitalism."`
	"CN-2391" `	"The return of the Alphas, or something like them."`
	"CN-2392" `	"Piracy and anarchy, like the pirates who dominated your world."`
	"CN-2393" `	"Alien invasion."`
	"CN-2394" `	She laughs. "A typical Free Worlds answer. I will confess, I am none too fond of Parliament, ordering the Navy to spend its time up in the paradise sector assisting snobby rich pilots who've run out of fuel instead of down here defending against the very real threats that lurk on the pirate worlds."`
	"CN-2395" `	"Since there is only one corporation in the galaxy that fits that description," she says, "I assume you are talking about the Syndicate. Any human organization can take on a life of its own, and act in ways that any of its individual members would consider immoral. That is a danger the Syndicate does face. but I find myself more concerned with certain threats that are closer to home."`
	"CN-2396" `	She seems surprised. "Not many in your generation would say that," she says. "Even here on Poisonwood, where we ought to know better, many of those who were born after the days of slavery think the Alphas are no more than a myth, a story that Parliament uses to justify maintaining such a large Navy."`
	"CN-2397" `	Alondo looks concerned. "I've heard the stories from the liberation of Poisonwood," he says, "but there was never any evidence. No photos, none of them captured. I thought it was just hype."`
	"CN-2398" `	She laughs. "Thugs. Children with no hope for the future. Petty criminals. The pirates are poorly organized, and their glory days are long past. But you are right, in a way, because those lawless worlds provide a hiding place for the few individuals who actually are a danger to our species. And that is the threat that weighs most heavily on my mind."`
	"CN-2399" `	She laughs. "You must watch far too many videos. The most powerful species in this galaxy are also the most peace-loving. Trust me, I should know. Here on the edge of human space, we receive... visitors, on occasion. They do not interfere in human events, but they came seeking information on a threat that concerns us both."`
	"CN-2400" `	"What sort of threat?" you ask.`
	"CN-2401" `	"Our world was enslaved for nearly a decade," she says. "Most of my childhood. We had been little more than an anarchist colony ourselves before that, though, so the Republic did nothing to aid us. Until the Disappearance."`
	"CN-2402" `	"What was the Disappearance?"`
	"CN-2403" `	"I was a teenage slave working in the factories at the time," she says. "Exactly the wrong age, as it turned out. One day the overseers informed us that all the eighteen-year-old girls had to have mandatory 'health checkups' that day. I won't describe what the 'checkup' involved, but it was bewildering and unpleasant. And nearly all those girls disappeared, that day. They never returned from the 'checkups.' Only a few of us were left behind. Most of the leftovers were girls who had been unlucky enough to already be pregnant at that age. Or lucky, as it turned out. But I didn't understand why they didn't take me."`
	"CN-2404" `	Alondo seems very disturbed by the story. "They were selling girls into prostitution?" he says.`
	"CN-2405" `	"That's what we assumed," she says, "but there were dozens of girls like me who were not taken, even though we were not pregnant. It didn't make sense. Anyway, somehow news of that event got off-world and not long after, the Navy came in massive numbers, destroyed the slaver fleets and liberated our planet. In the process, they tried to invade an underground facility up in the mountains, which is where they thought the girls were being kept. But the facility was rigged to self-destruct, and they never found out what had been going on inside the facility. No one inside it survived."`
	"CN-2406" `	"Did you ever find out why they let you go?"`
	"CN-2407" `	"My parents said it was because I was so willful and stubborn, too hard to control," she says. "But years later, we began to discover that all of us who were passed over had one thing in common. We were all infertile. Had been already, the day of the Disappearance. Which means that either a bunch of pirates had suddenly decided they wanted to leave behind their lives of crime and settle down and raise families... or those girls were being used as incubators."`
	"CN-2408" `	Alondo says, "I hear that was common during the Alpha wars. Alpha genetics were so unstable, they needed hundreds of test subjects to produce a handful of viable Alpha babies. Those were evil days."`
	"CN-2409" `	"Days that may yet return," she says. "Somewhere, maybe even nearby on Bloodsea or Greenrock or Albatross, the remnants of the Alphas may still be hiding. Creatures bred to be strong and clever and able to kill without a hint of remorse. And now that this sector of space is yours, the duty of defending against them becomes yours, as well. That is why I agreed to talk with you: to warn you of that reality."`
	"CN-2410" `	You and Alondo return to your ship with one more thing for the fledgling Free Worlds to worry about. "I guess now we should return to <planet> and report to the Council," he says.`
	"CN-2411" `You meet Tomek, Freya, and JJ at the spaceport, and the entire Council quickly convenes. Given that you were Alondo's transportation during his mission, you are included in the meeting. Alondo outlines the results of the diplomatic mission, which he believes has been a success. Upon hearing about the extra supplies heading to Tarazed, Tomek suggests increasing patrols in the Dirt Belt to the east to help defend Syndicate convoys while also moving supplies from Tarazed to various Free planets.`
	"CN-2412" `	"We're still healing from the last set of battles," says JJ. "An increased Free Worlds presence outside of our declared territory could be seen as a provocation."`
	"CN-2413" `	"No doubt it will, but we need to uphold our end of the bargain with the Syndicate if we want to keep them as a tentative ally," Tomek responds. "We also have our deal with Tarazed for them to begin selling some of their ships within our territory. Those ships won't do us much good if they're getting blasted to pieces by pirates before they even get here."`
	"CN-2414" `	"A deal with Tarazed for new ships? When did you make that?"`
	"CN-2415" `	"I'm willing to volunteer for escort duty."`
	"CN-2416" `	"No need," says JJ. "We have plenty of captains who are already assigned to escort duty. We may need you elsewhere."`
	"CN-2417" `	"Prior to when things went hot," says Tomek, "I saw to it that we could secure a supply line for new warships outside of our borders. Southbound may be a fine shipyard, but they alone can't supply us the warships we need, especially when the largest warship they build is the Bastion. Unfortunately, the Navy attacked before things could be finalized, and the outbreak of war has slowed things down, but Tarazed has assured us the deal is moving forward."`
	"CN-2418" `	"Don't forget that Tarazed is also our only supplier of fighters for Southbound's Type F Haulers," Freya adds. "Unless you count the Boxwing, but those don't help much in a fight."`
	"CN-2419" `	"There are a lot of moving parts at play in this conflict, Captain <last>," says JJ. "All we ask is that you stay focused on where we aim you, and you let us handle the finer details."`
	"CN-2420" `	After further discussion on the matter, the Council approves the increased patrols, although JJ remains somewhat apprehensive.`
	"CN-2421" `	"There is one other thing," Alondo says. "The Syndicate informed us that the Republic has Katya in custody, accused of terrorism."`
	"CN-2422" `	The news is a shock to everyone. "I had begun to worry that was the case," says Freya.`
	"CN-2423" `	"My contacts within the Navy have heard rumors, but I suppose this confirms it," says JJ.`
	"CN-2424" `	"Why have they not announced it publicly?" asks Tomek.`
	"CN-2425" `	"I suspect it's because they know she is innocent," says Alondo. "They say it is impossible to tell a lie to the Questioners, and in this case that will work in her favor."`
	"CN-2426" `	After further discussion, the Council eventually dismisses you as they move on to other topics that don't directly concern you.`
	"CN-2427" `	A while later, after the Council meeting is adjourned, Tomek approaches you and says, "Meet me in the spaceport when you are ready for your next assignment. Also," he gives you <payment>, "the Council has approved a bonus for you. Excellent work, Captain."`
	"CN-2428" `You meet up with Tomek and Freya, who are looking over a map of the nearby systems. "This is a choke point," says Freya, pointing to the Wei system. "Any attack on us will come either through Wei or Lesath, and Wei is much more likely. And that also means that if we can monitor what is happening there, we will have advance warning of any attack."`
	"CN-2429" `	"And with us strengthening our patrols to the east, we'll need any advance warning we can get, even if only a single day." says Tomek. "Now, as you may know, the planet Hope is in the Wei system. It's a former colony that is now an ice planet. Our plan is to deploy a sensor network on Hope, tracking every ship in system. Freya designed the equipment, so she can explain how to deploy it."`
	"CN-2430" `	Freya explains where on the planet each sensor should be installed, and how to cover them in insulative shielding so their heat and energy signatures will be difficult to detect. "Once the network is deployed," she says, "you will begin receiving telemetry. A good way to test it is to make sure it is picking up your own ship. Any questions?"`
	"CN-2431" `	"No, sounds good."`
	"CN-2432" `You land on Hope, place Freya's surveillance rigs in the locations she specified, and fire them up. Telemetry starts coming in, and you verify that your own ship is showing up in the scans. However, they are also picking up an unidentified heat signature on another part of Hope. Do you investigate?`
	"CN-2433" `	(Of course!)`
	"CN-2434" `	(No, sounds risky.)`
	"CN-2435" `	You approach the location, flying low to avoid detection, and come upon a Navy Gunboat, landed on the planet. Some distance away from the ship, several figures in thick snowsuits are setting up some sort of equipment with lots of antennae. It seems that the Navy had the same idea as Freya, of using this world as a listening post. Your sensors show that the Gunboat is powered down.`
	"CN-2436" `	The moment your ship comes over the horizon, they start running back toward the Gunboat. You destroy their equipment with a few well-placed shots, then train your guns on the crew members, who are still some distance from their ship. When they realize they cannot get back to it before being shot, they raise their hands in surrender.`
	"CN-2437" `	You count eight crew members in the group, which is the typical crew complement of a Gunboat. That may mean the Gunboat is uncrewed, and you could kill the crew and steal it. On the other hand, if there are more crew aboard the ship it would be better to destroy it first, then finish off the landing crew.`
	"CN-2438" `	(Destroy the ship, then finish off the crew.)`
	"CN-2439" `	(Kill the landing crew, then steal their ship.)`
	"CN-2440" `	(Accept the crew's surrender.)`
	"CN-2441" `	It turns out you made the right choice: someone is indeed onboard the Gunboat still, because the moment you open fire it raises shields and starts powering up its engines and weapons. But, your initial shots must have damaged some critical systems, because it only manages to fire a few shots at you and to lift off about thirty meters into the air before crashing back down onto the ice and exploding. You quickly pick off the landing crew as well; they have no place to hide on the broad, flat glacial expanse.`
	"CN-2442" `	Your own mission is complete, so it's time to return to <planet> and report to Freya.`
	"CN-2443" `	The landing crew has absolutely nowhere to hide in this glacial field; you pick them off easily. There is no response from the ship, so you land beside it and prepare to board it. But, the moment you open your hatch, the other ship roars to life, powering up its engines and beating a hasty retreat while firing a few parting shots at you from its turret. You fire up your own engines and pursue it...`
	"CN-2444" `	Most ships are equipped with external speakers for exactly this sort of situation. You target the ship, and your scanners identify it as the <npc>.`
	"CN-2445" `	"Crew of the <npc>, this is Captain <last> of the Free Worlds ship <ship>," you announce. "I accept your surrender, but will you each give me your word of honor that you will take no further part in fighting the Free Worlds?"`
	"CN-2446" `	The soldiers appear to think for a brief moment before one of them holds their hand high in front of them, giving you a thumbs-up sign. The rest of the soldiers quickly follow suit without any hesitation.`
	"CN-2447" `	"Thank you," you reply. "You may return to your ship and fly back to Republic space."`
	"CN-2448" `	The Navy soldiers exchange looks, apparently surprised, but they recover quickly. One of them snaps to attention and salutes you. You return the salute, and then, realizing their captain can't see you, flash your ship's external lights in acknowledgment. The <npc>'s crew fall into formation, march back to their ship, fire up their engines, and take off. Their weapon systems remain unarmed and inactive, as far as your sensors can tell.`
	"CN-2449" `	Your mission on this planet done, you launch into space too, monitoring the Navy ship.`
	"CN-2450" `You report back to Freya and Tomek. "I saw a weird sensor blip," you say, "but I was afraid to follow up on it. It may have been the Navy, planting sensors of their own, or doing something else on the planet."`
	"CN-2451" `You report back to Freya and Tomek. "The sensors are deployed," you say, "but I caught the Navy doing the same thing. I destroyed one of their installations, but there might be others."`
	"CN-2452" `	Tomek frowns. "What do you think, Freya?"`
	"CN-2453" `	"I'd say, live and let live. We have no plans to expand north, so it doesn't cost us anything for them to know what is happening in that system. And we don't have resources to spare on sweeping the planet for their sensors."`
	"CN-2454" `	"Makes sense to me."`
	"CN-2455" `	"Well, I'd rather not give them any advantage, no matter how slight."`
	"CN-2456" `	"Good," says Freya, "because I've got a much more interesting job for you to do next. The people at Kraz Cybernetics have a new toy they want to test out, and I volunteered you to help out. They're waiting for you on Rust, in the Kraz system."`
	"CN-2457" `	"It's up to you," says Tomek. "If you want to go back there, you can. But it'll just create more ill will, without gaining us any tactical advantage."`
	"CN-2458" `	"Also," says Freya, "I've got a much more interesting mission for you. The people at Kraz Cybernetics have a new toy they want to test out, and I volunteered you to help out. They're waiting for you on Rust, in the Kraz system."`
	"CN-2459" `	"Sorry, but I hate leaving a job unfinished. I want to destroy those sensors."`
	"CN-2460" `	"Okay, you've convinced me."`
	"CN-2461" `	"Fine," says Freya, "but report to Rust when you're done. And try not to get yourself killed." She's clearly disappointed in you.`
	"CN-2462" `You spend a while sweeping the planet and hoping that the Navy won't come after you. In all, you discover three more sensor installations. There is no way to be sure if you found them all, but it's time now for you to report for duty on Rust.`
	"CN-2463" `You are met in the spaceport by a junior engineer from Kraz Cybernetics, who leads you to their facility and introduces you to his boss, who is known as "Barmy Edward." Edward is wearing a set of thick welding glasses and smoking a cigarette. "Pleased to meet you," he says, extending a hand that is encased in a heavy leather glove.`
	"CN-2464" `	"Pleased to meet you, too, sir."`
	"CN-2465" `	"Same here."`
	"CN-2466" `	"Don't call me 'sir,'" he says. "I'm not wearing a suit."`
	"CN-2467" `	"Sorry," you say. "It's just all these militia habits I'm learning."`
	"CN-2468" `	"I've heard good things about your work," he says. "Assisting the Free Worlds and all. Not that I'm big on politics, but I do like blowing things up."`
	"CN-2469" `	"Me too."`
	"CN-2470" `	"Well, we try to only blow things up when strictly necessary."`
	"CN-2471" `	"Of course," he says. "Anyway, I bet you're wondering what new toys we're going to let you play with." You nod. He says, "We've been trying to come up with a weapon for our capital ships, something that's a match for one of the Navy's Heavy Laser Turrets. Something more elegant than those awful Quad Blaster Turrets the Syndicate makes. So I thought, why not take the biggest thing we've got, and then mount a pair of them on a turret?" He beckons for you to follow, and leads you through a door and into a hangar.`
	"CN-2472" `	In front of you is a turret. It is almost absurdly large: a pair of Plasma Cannons mounted on a massive rotating base. "Sixty tons," says Barmy Edward. "Draws more power than... well, than anything else, practically. Runs a little hot, too."`
	"CN-2473" `	"It's so... big!"`
	"CN-2474" `	"I want one!"`
	"CN-2475" `	"That's the ugliest turret I've ever seen."`
	"CN-2476" `	"Kind of mesmerizing, huh?" he says.`
	"CN-2477" `	"Well, you'll have to wait a month or two for us to work out the kinks," he says.`
	"CN-2478" `	"If you're looking for pretty," he says, "go buy one of those wussy guns that Lovelace Labs churn out. We don't do pretty here."`
	"CN-2479" `	"So, where do I come in?" you ask.`
	"CN-2480" `	"Well, the Council says no testing against the Navy... yet. No point in provoking a fight just to try out an untested weapon. So I asked them what other target they could suggest, and they mentioned this pirate ship by the name of Red Nile that's been haunting the <marks> system, sniping on merchants that take a wrong turn and end up there."`
	"CN-2481" `	With a grand gesture, he indicates an aging Tarazed Falcon parked in the far corner of the hangar. It's a little rusty, and the paint is flaking, but a Falcon is an impressive ship under any circumstances. "We packed four of our prototypes into our department's very own test ship, the Walloping Window-Blind. We can't let you fly her, of course," he says, "on account of she's dearer to us than our own children. So the plan is, the Window-Blind will accompany you to <marks>, and you fight the pirates together, taking careful note of how the guns perform. Sound like fun?"`
	"CN-2482" `	"You bet!"`
	"CN-2483" `	"What sort of ship is the Red Nile?"`
	"CN-2484" `	"One of those antiques from Betelgeuse," he says. "Shouldn't give you any bother. Meet us back here when you're done."`
	"CN-2485" `When you enter the hangar, the Window-Blind has just returned, and a team of engineers is looking it over. Barmy Edward puts down his work to come over and debrief you. "How did the turrets perform?" he asks.`
	"CN-2486" `	"Very impressive. I want a few of those on my own ship."`
	"CN-2487" `	"Well, I was a bit worried about the ship overheating, but otherwise they work well."`
	"CN-2488" `	"Yes," he said, "the team sent me some videos of the battle. First-rate carnage. I was very pleased. Any weak spots you noticed?"`
	"CN-2489" `	"Yes, it will require a lot of cooling," he says. "Any other weak spots?"`
	"CN-2490" `	"It seems like the only way to fit a gun this big into most ships is by leaving half the hardpoints empty. It's a bit impractical."`
	"CN-2491" `	"It worked well against a large ship, but I wonder how well the turrets could track fighters."`
	"CN-2492" `	"It's true," he says, "most ships are designed expecting to be equipped with a larger number of smaller guns. But we think this might open up some interesting new directions in ship design.`
	"CN-2493" `	"I guess we'll need to test it to find out," he says, "but our main goal was to have a weapon that could do serious damage to a Cruiser. Right now the Navy's heaviest ships have ours severely outgunned.`
	"CN-2494" `	"This is to thank you for your help." Barmy hands you <payment>. "To help you pay for your first Plasma Turret once we've got them on the market," he says.`
	"CN-2495" `	"When do you think that will be?" you ask.`
	"CN-2496" `	"A month or two. I'll send you a message when they're available. Oh, and as for your next assignment, you're escorting a supply convoy to the front. You can meet up with them in the spaceport."`
	"CN-2497" `When you land, a message pops up on your communicator from Barmy Edward. A photograph is enclosed as well. The message reads:`
	"CN-2498" `	Rejoice, Captain! The next time you are on Rust, you will be able to purchase Plasma Turrets for your very own.`
	"CN-2499" `				Regards,`
	"CN-2500" `						B. Edward Tivrusky`
	"CN-2501" `						Chief Offensive Engineer`
	"CN-2502" `						Kraz Cybernetics`
	"CN-2503" `In the spaceport, you meet up with a woman wearing a militia uniform and carrying a clipboard. "Are you Captain <last>?" she asks. You nod. "We have a large shipment of weapons and equipment that needs to go to the militia base on <planet>. Your job is to make sure none of these ships get... lost in transit." She points to a large landing pad where you count ten Star Barges lined up next to each other.`
	"CN-2504" `	"Isn't it risky to transport valuable cargo in such flimsy and vulnerable ships?"`
	"CN-2505" `	"Hey, I'm a starship captain, not a cattle herder!"`
	"CN-2506" `	"No problem. I'll see to it that they arrive safely."`
	"CN-2507" `	"It would be, except that our Free Worlds military presence has nearly, though not entirely, eliminated piracy in the Rim. So while we still need an escort, we're saving a lot of money on crew salaries by using ships that can be piloted by one person."`
	"CN-2508" `	"Okay, I hope you're right!"`
	"CN-2509" `	She grins. "Yes, I know it's not terribly glamorous work, and keeping track of a big fleet of slow ships is a pain. But, Bulk Freighters are just too expensive to use on internal cargo convoys. Just make sure you do a headcount when you arrive in each system."`
	"CN-2510" `	"Okay, whatever it takes to further the cause of freedom, I'll do it."`
	"CN-2511" `You find Tomek sitting at the spaceport bar with a galactic map. The map has notes written all over it, with lines marking the current Free Worlds and Republic territories. "Good to see you, <first>!" he says. "I pray whatever weapons Barmy Edward had you testing worked well. Most of his inventions are pure genius, but some are just bizarre and useless."`
	"CN-2512" `	You describe to him the impressive performance of the Plasma Turrets, and the challenge of finding a ship with enough size for them. "Excellent!" he says. "That opens up some interesting tactical possibilities. But now it's time to switch gears entirely."`
	"CN-2513" `	He smooths out the map, sweeping a few stray peanuts and crumbs off it. Apparently he's been sitting here for quite a while. "Right now," he says, "the Navy is leaving us alone, and we have no good reason to attack them. So the Council has been turning its attention to other matters, namely the pirates. They're a big threat to our shipping, and every shipment lost to piracy is a dent in our war effort. Plus, if we could do something about them it would gain us a whole lot of support in the nearby Republic systems. If we can gain sympathy from Republic worlds, then we will lower the Republic's appetite for war."`
	"CN-2514" `	"Agreed."`
	"CN-2515" `	"But isn't the Navy still the bigger threat?"`
	"CN-2516" `	"They certainly are, but there's little we can do about them right now aside from prepare for their next move. We have absolutely no desire to take all of human space away from the Republic. All we want is the freedom to govern our own selves, here in our one corner of the galaxy. So attacking systems that the Republic holds right now would make absolutely no sense, and would likely only embolden the Republic, reinforcing their desire to see us conquered."`
	"CN-2517" `	"I suppose you're right," you say.`
	"CN-2518" `	"So, here's the plan," he says. "These four systems belong to the pirates." He points to them on the map. "We want you to scout out all four systems. Just a quick fly-through, no need to land on their planets. Then report back to us, and we'll decide what our next step will be."`
	"CN-2519" `	"Sounds good."`
	"CN-2520" `	"What about the pirate systems to the north of Men?"`
	"CN-2521" `	Tomek shrugs. "Simply put, those worlds aren't a threat to us right now. From what we can gather, most of the factions there are focused on internal power struggles at the moment rather than piracy in the Rim. Those CCOR guerrillas are more than enough to keep any pirate warlords there busy for the immediate future."`
	"CN-2522" `	"CCOR?"`
	"CN-2523" `	"Understood."`
	"CN-2524" `	Tomek looks surprised. "I assumed you knew. The Confederated Councils of the Outer Rim was a government that tried to practice its own particular flavor of communism outside of the Republic's influence. They fell around 50 years ago, and their former planets are now under the control of either pirate gangs or guerrilla groups trying to restore the CCOR. I wouldn't worry about the guerrillas too much - at this point, they're little more than a pirate gang themselves."`
	"CN-2525" `	As you are about to leave, he says, "Oh, one other thing: you've been approved for a salary raise to 2,100 credits. We figure that helping you maintain a slightly larger ship is a worthwhile investment. Congratulations, Captain."`
	"CN-2526" `Surprisingly, when you get back to <origin> you find that Tomek is no longer there. A courier hands you a short note: "Captain <last>: because the decision of how to deal with the pirates is of interest to all the Free Worlds, the Council has decided to convene the first session of the Free Worlds Senate ahead of schedule. I have already left for Bourne. You have been assigned to transport Senator Arianna Huygens of <planet>; please pick her up as soon as possible and bring her with you."`
	"CN-2527" `Senator Huygens turns out to be an attractive woman in her mid-fifties, with a dour expression on her face. "About time you showed up," is all she says when you introduce yourself.`
	"CN-2528" `	You take one of her suitcases and lead her into your ship to her room. Once you get there, she says, "I'm glad the Council relented and agreed to convene the Senate. I had begun to worry that the democracy we signed up for had become an oligarchy instead."`
	"CN-2529" `	"What do you mean?" you ask.`
	"CN-2530" `	"Don't play dumb. I mean the Council, deciding everything."`
	"CN-2531" `	"Don't worry, it was never their intention to hold on to power once each world had had sufficient time to elect their own representatives."`
	"CN-2532" `	"Hey, the Council has provided great leadership at a time when no one else was ready to take charge. Give them some respect."`
	"CN-2533" `	She looks angry for a minute, then her expression softens. "Oh, pardon me," she says. "I was treating you like another scheming politician, but now I realize you're way too clueless for that. Tell me, Captain, do you know what makes politics similar to piloting a ship?"`
	"CN-2534" `	"I have no idea."`
	"CN-2535" `	"Ummm... they both involve momentous decisions that have serious consequences?"`
	"CN-2536" `	"They both require someone skilled and decisive to be in command?"`
	"CN-2537" `	"The correct answer," she says, "was, 'nothing whatsoever; they are entirely different disciplines.' Now, hurry up, I hope to be on Bourne a week from now." You consider explaining to her that it's impossible to get there that fast, but decide against it.`
	"CN-2538" `	"The correct answer," she says, "was, 'nothing whatsoever; they are entirely different disciplines.' Now, hurry up, I hope to be on Bourne a week from now." You consider explaining to her that it's impossible to get there that fast using a hyperdrive, but decide against it.`
	"CN-2539" `	It's a good thing you have a jump drive.`
	"CN-2540" `You drop off Senator Huygens, who appears uncharacteristically pleased. "Good work Captain <last>, I see we made good time. It seems you're far more reliable than most captains I work with," she says before walking off.`
	"CN-2541" `You drop off Senator Huygens, who says nothing by way of acknowledging your help except, "It's about time we got here." She hurries off.`
	"CN-2542" `	A few minutes later, someone shouts, "Hello there, Captain <last>!" It's Ijs Springborn. "I'm glad to see you again," he says.`
	"CN-2543" `	"You too. What brings you to Bourne?"`
	"CN-2544" `	"You too. Did you hear what happened to Katya?"`
	"CN-2545" `	"I guess I'm sort of a lobbyist," he says, "here to make Katya's dream a reality."`
	"CN-2546" `	"Yes, that's why I'm here," he says, "to make sure her dream becomes a reality."`
	"CN-2547" `	"Which dream?" you ask.`
	"CN-2548" `	"Terraforming for the masses. A publicly funded university and research center. Are you familiar with the Free Worlds taxation model?"`
	"CN-2549" `	"Not really," you say.`
	"CN-2550" `	"It's brilliant. And probably totally unsustainable. Each world that joins us negotiates a certain yearly tax amount based on their population and resources. In return they gain access to our defense fleet and other shared resources. Twenty percent of each planet's tax payments are 'unrestricted,' money the Free Worlds can use for whatever we think is most important. But the rest of the taxes can be earmarked for whatever projects that world thinks are most important. Those taxes can also be in the form of a donation, such as supplying ships or crews for the common militia..."`
	"CN-2551" `	He continues talking for quite some time. You stop even trying to follow what he is saying. Finally he sees the blank expression on your face and stops babbling. "The point is," he says, "if we can convince enough worlds to pool their money, the Conservatory will become a reality. Our own public university."`
	"CN-2552" `	"So you're here to talk to the senators?"`
	"CN-2553" `	"Sounds like that could be a great public relations move for convincing more worlds to join us."`
	"CN-2554" `	"Indeed," he says. "Anyway, I'm off to a meeting, but meet me later in the spaceport if you've got room for some passengers."`
	"CN-2555" `A few minutes later, Tomek shows up at your ship. "Glad you made it," he says. "Sorry to disappear on you earlier."`
	"CN-2556" `	"Has the Senate decided anything about the pirates yet?"`
	"CN-2557" `	"It seems like some people are a little bit hostile toward the Council."`
	"CN-2558" `	"Not yet. This is why I wanted to get as much done as possible while we were still under a relatively agile leadership structure. Getting two dozen politicians to agree on any course of action is... difficult. What did your reconnaissance turn up?"`
	"CN-2559" `	"You mean Arianna? Don't worry, she's one of those people who by reflex opposes any idea that comes from someone other than her. Most people appreciate what the Council has done, and in fact before you even arrived the Senate voted to give us a continued advisory role, under the Senate's supervision."`
	"CN-2560" `	"They had that vote before she arrived?"`
	"CN-2561" `	"Yes, we already had a quorum. She was the last to get here, because of her transportation troubles. Sorry to give you a menial job like that, by the way. Now, what can you tell me about the pirates?"`
	"CN-2562" `	You show him your sensor logs. "I've been trying to decide what advice we should give the Senate," he says. "A shock and awe assault on Greenrock might bring all the pirate systems in this sector under our control overnight. But we might have fewer losses if we attack the smaller worlds first, then demand that Greenrock surrender. In any case, something must be done. Even though our biggest concern is the Republic, much of the animus toward them is as a result of their failure to get piracy in this region under control. We must succeed where they have failed, otherwise we'll be no better than they were. If confidence in this project falters, the Free Worlds will collapse, and we'll be back to square one, except with all our leadership, all those who got us this far, in prison."`
	"CN-2563" `	"I say we strike right at their heart, and launch a massive assault on Greenrock."`
	"CN-2564" `	"Why not start by clearing out the Antares system? It's not very well defended."`
	"CN-2565" `	"Occupying four pirate systems in perpetuity would be a huge drain on our resources. Why not try to negotiate with them, say by offering those worlds freedom from our interference as long as they stop supporting pirate fleets?"`
	"CN-2566" `	"That's definitely the fastest solution," he says, "although it would also be a difficult one. Defending an assault from the Navy was one thing, but subjugating the seat of pirate power in the region is another. It would be a great show of strength, though, not only to the pirates, but also to the Republic."`
	"CN-2567" `	"Sounds reasonable to me," he says. "We could probably do that with minimal loss of life. But the risk is that Greenrock would still refuse to surrender. Anyone could nip at the weakest member of the herd, but if we take down Greenrock first it would be a great show of strength, not only to the pirates, but also to the Republic."`
	"CN-2568" `	He frowns. "Negotiate with criminals?"`
	"CN-2569" `	"I'm told that only a small portion of the people on those worlds actually engage in piracy," you say, "and many of them are children pressed into service as crew members."`
	"CN-2570" `	"That may be," he says, "but their leaders are dangerous criminals, perhaps even more dangerous than the Navy, because they have no honor or morality. Every anarchist world is also a possible haven for other lawless individuals, including any of the Alphas who are still in hiding, so I say we need to capture and control those worlds. The heart of piracy in this region is at Greenrock, and if we take down Greenrock first it would be a great show of strength, not only to the pirates, but also to the Republic."`
	"CN-2571" `	"But I suppose we need to wait for the Senate to decide?" you ask.`
	"CN-2572" `	"Perhaps," he says. "In the meantime, I've got a related mission for you. While the Senate is deliberating, I'd like you to lead a patrol through our systems in the Southern Rim, to keep up enough of a presence to keep the pirates at bay. Once you've finished patrolling, bring the fleet back to <planet>. By then I should be back there, and we'll discuss our next steps."`
	"CN-2573" `When you updated your game, you were in the middle of a story arc in the Free Worlds campaign that has since been changed. In order to continue, you should go to <destination>.`
	"CN-2574" `Tomek meets you outside the spaceport bar and pulls you roughly aside into an alley. "Do you still think that an attack on the pirates is our best option?" he asks.`
	"CN-2575" `	"Yes, it's our best chance for eliminating the pirates."`
	"CN-2576" `	"Only if the Senate agrees. This is a democratic government, after all."`
	"CN-2577" `	"Why? What's going on?"`
	"CN-2578" `	"Those fools in the Senate want us to negotiate with the pirates," he says. "We need to save them from their own stupidity. I've rallied a battle fleet waiting for you on <planet>, brave captains who are willing to join an assault on Greenrock."`
	"CN-2579" `	"Then head to <planet> immediately. I've rallied some militia captains there who will join you in a battle fleet. Our target is Greenrock. It's now or never, before the Senate finishes their work of castrating our military."`
	"CN-2580" `	Just then, JJ walks out of the bar and sees you talking with Tomek. "Tomek," he says, "what are you doing? Freya and I are waiting inside." He beckons you into the bar.`
	"CN-2581" `	Inside, Freya and Alondo are sitting at a table looking at Tomek's battered galactic map. Tomek, JJ, and you sit down with them.`
	"CN-2582" `You find Tomek in the spaceport bar, talking with Freya, JJ, and Alondo around Tomek's battered galactic map. "Well, Captain," says Tomek, "you're going to be happy to hear this. The Senate recommended the same approach you did: negotiating with the pirates." He seems very upset at this.`
	"CN-2583" `	JJ explains, "We've been asked to deliver an ultimatum to each pirate world: the Free Worlds maintains the right to attack any ships engaged in piracy. Any world that continues to support piracy, slavery, or illegal weapons manufacture will be a valid military target for us. But first, we are to offer each world the opportunity to become truly autonomous and free from outside intervention, if they will pledge to cease those activities."`
	"CN-2584" `	Freya says, "The thing is, just like any other world, most people on the 'pirate' planets are just ordinary farmers, or factory workers, or whatever. The only difference is, they want no off-world government telling them how to live. So that's what we're going to offer them."`
	"CN-2585" `	"Our first mission will be to Thule in the Men system," Alondo says. "Although Thule is not the biggest hub of piracy in the region, it is the most populous with almost a billion people, a greater population than all the other pirate worlds in the region combined. We hope that by first coming to an agreement with the majority of the population of pirate worlds in the region, the rest will be easier to negotiate with. I will be leading the negotiations."`
	"CN-2586" `	"That's good news! I think the Senate made the right choice."`
	"CN-2587" `	"How do you negotiate with a billion anarchists? Sounds like that will take forever."`
	"CN-2588" `	"That doesn't make any sense. If we leave those pirate worlds alone, they'll stab us in the back some time in the future."`
	"CN-2589" `	"Well, I think the Senate has water flowing through their veins instead of blood," says Tomek, "and I think asking anarchists to make a binding diplomatic contract is an exercise in futility. We should speak with them in the only language they'll understand: violence."`
	"CN-2590" `	"Good question," Tomek remarks mockingly. "It's almost like this will be an exercise in futility. We should speak with them in the only language they'll understand: violence."`
	"CN-2591" `	"Absolutely," says Tomek. "The Senate doesn't know what's best for them. Perhaps we should save them from their own stupidity and make sure the right thing gets done. A world of anarchists will never come to a binding agreement. We should speak with them in the only language they'll understand: violence."`
	"CN-2592" `	"Tomek," says Freya, "this is a democracy. We follow the Senate's orders."`
	"CN-2593" `	"And what if those orders are wrong?" Tomek shouts, drawing attention from some patrons of the bar. "When has diplomacy ever worked with pirates? Did diplomacy work for the Republic in the 2800s when they sought to eliminate slave trades across the galaxy? Has diplomacy worked during the years of neglect that the Navy has shown us with the constant raids that the South has experienced? No, it didn't! It was the force of the Republic Navy that nearly eliminated the slave trade! It was the force of OUR militia which finally put an end to the constant raids against our people!"`
	"CN-2594" `	"Tomek, that's enough," Alondo says softly.`
	"CN-2595" `	JJ, ignoring Tomek's outbursts, says to you, "Captain <last>, the Senate wants you to travel to Thule and deliver their ultimatum. You will be given a single Falcon as an escort: not enough for a battle fleet, just enough to keep you safe. You are to avoid engaging any pirates you meet, if possible. Alondo will be aboard the Falcon and will negotiate with the locals once you arrive. Understood?"`
	"CN-2596" `	"So, we're not going to attack the pirates?"`
	"CN-2597" `	Tomek says, "No, we're just going to let them sit there waiting to stab us in the back at the first opportunity."`
	"CN-2598" `	Tomek looks at you in disbelief. "So you're just going to agree with them? You're just going to let the pirates stab us in the back at the first opportunity?"`
	"CN-2599" `	JJ puts a hand on his shoulder and says, a little more firmly than Alondo did, "Calm down, Tomek. We're obeying the orders of the Senate. We have to honor the democratic process even when we don't like the decisions they make."`
	"CN-2600" `	"Oh, the Senate. Of course. The Senate this, the Senate that," Tomek says mockingly while throwing his head back. "The Senate is in no position to be commanding this war. They do not have the military experience of JJ or myself. Do you think the Republic Parliament is busying themselves voting on every little fleet movement, or do you think they've put this in the hands of the Navy and told them to win this war? I made my reasons clear to you all many times why I didn't want to convene the Senate, because they would only hinder and handicap us from winning this war, and that's exactly what they're already doing!"`
	"CN-2601" `	"Tomek! That's enough!" JJ yells, which seems to draw even more surprise and attention than when Tomek yelled. "The Council decided that the Senate would convene, and so it did. It is only by the grace of the Senate that the Council even still exists."`
	"CN-2602" `	"And it'll be by the grace of God that we don't all end up dead because of it," Tomek responds.`
	"CN-2603" `	JJ turns to you and Alondo. "<first>. Alondo. I pray your mission to Thule is a success."`
	"CN-2604" `	"I'll introduce you to your escort," says Tomek, shaking off JJ's hand as he leads you out of the bar.`
	"CN-2605" `	Once you are outside, he pulls you aside and says, "If at any point you are attacked by pirates along the way or change your mind, head to <planet>. I've rallied a battle fleet waiting there, brave captains who are willing to join in an assault on Greenrock. If you join them, they should have enough firepower to take the system."`
	"CN-2606" `	"You're asking me to go against the Senate's decision?"`
	"CN-2607" `	"Never mind," he says, "I guess you're as weak-willed as the rest of them." He walks back into the bar and leaves you alone.`
	"CN-2608" `	Once you are outside, he pulls you aside and says, "Remember what we talked about, <first>." He walks back into the bar and leaves you alone.`
	"CN-2609" `When you land on <origin>, you find the fleet that Tomek mentioned: a few militia heavy and medium warships, a carrier, three squadrons of interceptors, and even four merchant ships of varying sizes. In total the fleet is nearly as large as one of the fleets that defended Sabik or Kornephoros, but as you survey the motley mix of grizzled militia veterans, young, naive interceptor pilots, and eager merchant captains, you can't help but wonder if a fleet of this size has a good chance against the strongest pirate world in Southern space.`
	"CN-2610" `	The Navy failed to conquer Longjump. Why would a fleet of a similar size be capable of conquering Greenrock? Perhaps the Senate was right in suggesting a diplomatic solution. Or perhaps luck will be in your favor.`
	"CN-2611" `	(Go ahead and attack Greenrock, disobeying the Senate's orders regardless of the consequences.)`
	"CN-2612" `	(Give up on Tomek's scheme and follow the Senate's orders to make a diplomatic visit to Thule.)`
	"CN-2613" `	You speak with some of the captains of the invasion fleet. Apparently Tomek has been busy visiting spaceports and giving rousing speeches about ending piracy and slavery once and for all in the South, hence the fleet being so large despite being unsanctioned by the Senate. That also explains the inclusion of a few merchant captains in the fleet, likely local captains who overheard the speeches and aren't interested in joining the Free Worlds to fight against the Navy, but are more than happy to make life easier for their freighters if this succeeds.`
	"CN-2614" `	You plan to leave after nightfall, which should hopefully mean that Alondo doesn't realize that you've left him behind until it's too late. Now all that remains is for you to travel to <system>, defeat whatever opposition you find, and land on <planet>. Or die trying.`
	"CN-2615" `As the remaining invasion fleet comes in for a landing on <origin>, you spot small pirate ships scattering from the spaceport, not into space, but instead into the far reaches of the Greenrock wilderness. When you reach the spaceport, there is a wild mix of emotions from the locals who remained. Some spit at you and curse you out. Others thank you for driving off the pirates, even if only temporarily. Others still thank you for freeing them and ask for transportation off-world before the slavers return; Greenrock is the hub of the underground slave trade in the galaxy, and it seems in the confusion and rush for some criminals to escape the spaceport, they left their slaves behind.`
	"CN-2616" `	In an attempt to not get yourselves assassinated by pirates looking for revenge, the fleet forms their ships into a circle just outside the spaceport and keeps an eye out for aggressors while waiting for Tomek, or anyone of authority within the Free Worlds for that matter, to show up and determine your next move.`
	"CN-2617" `	Hours later, Tomek's ship arrives, with even more ships in tow, likely to support a continued occupation. Tomek greets the invasion fleet, looking ecstatic. "Wonderful work, all of you. The people of the Free Worlds will be thanking you for generations." Tomek orders the members of the occupation fleet to sweep the spaceport, freeing any slaves they find and arresting any known criminals and warlords. "We can't possibly take in every criminal here, but if you find someone with a big name, we need to take this opportunity to arrest them."`
	"CN-2618" `	After Tomek is done giving orders and celebrating, he approaches you and gives your hand a firm shake. "Thank you for listening to reason, Captain <last>. I know I asked a lot of you when I asked you to directly disobey Senate orders."`
	"CN-2619" `	"What now?"`
	"CN-2620" `	"I'm sure we'll be getting in trouble for this."`
	"CN-2621" `	Tomek smiles. "Now we do what we can to rout the criminals and warlords out of this place while we have the advantage. The more damage we can do to them, the less innocent people within the Free Worlds will be hurt by piracy in the future. I've already ordered the men to sweep the spaceport, and we'll be leaving a fleet stationed here for some time to keep the peace. In time we may need to pull back to focus on the Navy again, but for now Greenrock is ours."`
	"CN-2622" `	"What about the Senate?" you ask. "We'll certainly be in trouble for this."`
	"CN-2623" `	"No good deed goes unpunished, I suppose," Tomek says. "Despite the great opportunity we've created for the Free Worlds, I have no doubt that the Senate will not be happy with the actions we took here. Should they attempt to punish us, let me take full responsibility for what was done here. They need me, so my punishment will not be too severe, and any punishment that is placed upon you should hopefully be minor by comparison. If asked, you were simply following the orders of a superior."`
	"CN-2624" `	Just then, you hear another ship coming in for a landing. You both look up to see a Falcon landing in the spaceport: Alondo's Falcon that you were supposed to escort to Thule. Tomek has a somber look on his face. "Let me speak with them first," he says to you. "Meet with us in the spaceport later. Hopefully I'll have smoothed things over by then."`
	"CN-2625" `When you return to the spaceport, you're pointed to a small tent staging area by a militia officer. Inside you find Tomek speaking with Freya and Alondo, both of whom look rather unhappy.`
	"CN-2626" `	"Do you not realize how weak of a position this puts us into?" Alondo says to Tomek. "If we want to keep Greenrock then it will be a perpetual resource drain that we cannot afford right now."`
	"CN-2627" `	"You're not seeing the bigger picture," Tomek responds. "Yes, we will need to spend resources keeping Greenrock under control, but we're already spending copious amounts of resources defending our planets, systems, and freighters from pirates as is. If we have Greenrock under our control and the other pirate worlds become afraid to act against us then that is one concentrated place that we need to focus on as opposed to being spread thin across our territory. In the end I imagine this will be a net positive for us."`
	"CN-2628" `	"That is yet to be seen," says Freya, "but right now we're in the red. Do you know how much we're going to need to spend on repairs as a result of this stunt of yours, not only in credits but in man-hours? A massive amount of our fleet is out of commission because of this. If the Navy attacked now we'd be practically defenseless."`
	"CN-2629" `	Tomek pauses as he notices you standing at the entryway to the tent. Freya and Alondo also look over to you. "Care to explain yourself?" Freya asks.`
	"CN-2630" `	"I was simply following the orders of a superior. This was Tomek's idea."`
	"CN-2631" `	"The orders of your superior were the orders from the Senate to escort me to Thule for a diplomatic mission," Alondo responds angrily. "Now that I'm late and word of this has spread quickly, the people of Thule are not interested in negotiating. I'm sure the Senate would love to hear your explanation. You know full well that you should not have come here, yet you did. You, Tomek, and every other captain here will be answering to the Senate shortly."`
	"CN-2632" `	Freya heaves a deep sigh and looks to the side for a moment before reaching to her hip, drawing her sidearm, and shooting you. You do not have an opportunity to react. You must have caught Freya on a particularly bad day. Try again.`
	"CN-2633" `	"Well maybe you'll be willing to explain yourself to the Senate," Alondo responds angrily. "Your orders were to escort me to Thule for a diplomatic mission, but now that I'm late and word of this has spread quickly, the people of Thule are not interested in negotiating. You know full well that you should not have come here, yet you did. You, Tomek, and every other captain who took part in this attack will be answering to the Senate shortly."`
	"CN-2634" `	Before anyone can continue arguing, JJ rushes into the tent. "Sorry to interrupt, but this little spat is going to need to wait. I just got word that our sensors on Hope have detected increased Navy fleet movements. It seems like they're getting ready for an assault."`
	"CN-2635" `	"Have they entered our space?" Alondo asks.`
	"CN-2636" `	"No, not yet. Not even a single scout," says JJ.`
	"CN-2637" `	"Leave a small fleet here to maintain our occupation, but move the rest of our available forces to <system>," Tomek says, taking charge of the situation. "Recall the eastern patrols. They might arrive late to any battle, but they can at least act as reinforcements if necessary."`
	"CN-2638" `	"You're in no position to be giving orders," Freya says, looking disgusted at Tomek. "You and <first> should both be placed under arrest for disobeying the Senate."`
	"CN-2639" `	"No," JJ says. "At least not yet. If the Navy is about to attack then we need everyone we can get. We'll resolve this matter once we have the time. And for now, Tomek is still a part of the Council. But if you won't listen to his orders, then I imagine you'll listen to mine, and I agree with Tomek, at least in this instance. Do what he says. Move our forces to <system> and recall any patrols."`
	"CN-2640" `	With that, JJ leaves the tent, hurrying off to a ship. Alondo too leaves without a word. As Freya begins to leave, she turns back to you and Tomek. "I'm very disappointed in you. Both of you." She exits the tent, leaving you and Tomek alone.`
	"CN-2641" `	"You should get going," Tomek says solemnly. "And don't get yourself killed in this battle just because of this little mess here. As disappointed as they might be, you still have a part to play. The Free Worlds still needs you. I can feel it." He pauses for a moment before saying, "See you on <planet>," and leaving.`
	"CN-2642" `One of the first people to step off the Falcon "Terebinth" when it lands is Alondo. You ask him what the plan is.`
	"CN-2643" `	"Well," he says, "the people I'll be meeting with here are tribal elders, of a sort. But the tribes are separated not so much by ethnicity, as by geography and ideology. I can't claim to understand all the intricacies, really, but in matters affecting the entire planet they have authority to make consensus decisions. Of course, there are hundreds of independent settlements and groups that may or may not abide by that decision. So I hate to say it, but Tomek is right that this will be difficult to pull off."`
	"CN-2644" `	"What do you think our odds are of a successful negotiation?"`
	"CN-2645" `	"What do we do if diplomacy doesn't work?"`
	"CN-2646" `	Before he has a chance to respond, the sky lights up with incoming particle beams, and you see one of the Terebinth's engines erupt in a gout of flames. "What the hell?" says Alondo.`
	"CN-2647" `	The captain of the Terebinth, who is standing next to you, stares slack-jawed at his ship for a second before jumping into action. "Captain <last>," he says, "fire up your ship immediately and go after whoever is attacking us. I'll call for backup, but you will need to keep the attackers distracted until they arrive."`
	"CN-2648" `A pall of smoke still hangs over the spaceport, and as you are coming in for a landing you fly over one landing pad where bodies draped in sheets have been laid out side by side: dozens of casualties. Several buildings are in ruins, some of them still smoldering.`
	"CN-2649" `	Alondo has survived, fortunately. He tells you, "While the fight was going on overhead, I met with the elders, and they agreed that now that the Free Worlds exist and opposing the pirates is a viable option, they will try to put an end to piracy in this system. But they have no interest whatsoever in joining the Free Worlds."`
	"CN-2650" `	"That's the best we had hoped for, right?"`
	"CN-2651" `	"While we've got our fleet here, why not just demand that they join us?"`
	"CN-2652" `	"You can't force people to join a democracy," he says. "Maybe some day they'll be ready, but in the meantime, any pressure we exert on them will turn them from an almost-ally into an enemy."`
	"CN-2653" `	"Indeed," he says, "I hate to say it, but that pirate attack actually helped our case. But only time will tell what will come of this experiment of letting worlds be 'independent.' If more worlds start wanting total independence, rather than joining us, our future may not be sustainable."`
	"CN-2654" `	"So, what do we do next?" you ask.`
	"CN-2655" `	"Well, the Terebinth is patched up, but they could use an escort back to <planet>. After that, you'll have to see what the Senate or the Council want you to do."`
	"CN-2656" `You arrive back on Longjump to a hero's welcome. People have heard of the battle you fought on Thule and the deal that was forged with the locals there. JJ and Freya greet you too, and congratulate you. But then Freya says, "We need to talk in private."`
	"CN-2657" `	You lead them into your ship, where Freya explains, "Soon after you left for Thule, Tomek took off on his own and raised a fleet for an attack on Greenrock. He thought the Senate's plan of making a deal with the pirate worlds was too cowardly, and that we needed a show of strength instead. Surprisingly, his stunt succeeded; Greenrock is now nominally under Free Worlds control."`
	"CN-2658" `	"This puts us in a rather difficult position," says JJ. "Much of Tomek's fleet didn't survive the assault, and those ships didn't come out of thin air; they were intended for defensive purposes in case the Navy attacks again. Word of this has spread quickly. Thule is already second guessing their deal with us, and if Thule has heard of this then there's no doubt in my mind that the Republic has as well."`
	"CN-2659" `	"And regardless of his success, an invasion of Greenrock was not approved by the Senate," says Freya. "Tomek was detained on Greenrock by some of our officers on order of the Senate, and he's currently being transported to Bourne for a hearing."`
	"CN-2660" `	"Why would Tomek do something like that? It's unthinkable!"`
	"CN-2661" `	"How can the Senate have him arrested? He's part of the Council!"`
	"CN-2662" `	"That's easy to answer," says Freya. "He didn't like the idea of taking orders from the Senate. He thought they should treat him like a hero and go along with whatever he thought best."`
	"CN-2663" `	"Is it really that easy?" says JJ softly. Freya raises an eyebrow, but doesn't respond to the question.`
	"CN-2664" `	JJ and Freya are both quiet for a minute, then Freya says, "You know, there are people in the Senate who worry that the Council could become the ruling authority in the Free Worlds, instead of a democratic Senate. It wouldn't be the first time a people's revolution turned into an oligarchy. We of the Council have to be careful not to let that happen."`
	"CN-2665" `	"So, what will happen to Tomek?" you ask.`
	"CN-2666" `	"That's for the Senate to decide," says JJ. "But he's a tactical genius. We'll need his advice, if this war turns worse."`
	"CN-2667" `	Just then, Alondo comes running onto your ship, looking particularly worried. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything too important, but I just received word that our sensors on Hope have detected increased Navy fleet movements. It seems like they're getting ready for an assault."`
	"CN-2668" `	"Have they entered our space?" JJ asks.`
	"CN-2669" `	"No, not yet. Not even a single scout," says Alondo.`
	"CN-2670" `	"We should head to <planet> before deciding our next move," says Freya.`
	"CN-2671" `	"About that," says Alondo. "It seems like Tomek is way ahead of us. The news that Tomek is under arrest by the Senate didn't spread quickly enough, and an officer gave him the news about the sensors. He argued that since his position in the Council hasn't yet been revoked, he still has the power to command the militia, and he already ordered all available forces to <system>, including recalling our patrols in the eastern Dirt Belt. The officers who were detaining him reluctantly agreed, given the situation, and released him."`
	"CN-2672" `	"What?" Freya says with disbelief. "Tomek is in no position to be giving orders! Let everyone know that he is not to be obeyed!"`
	"CN-2673" `	Freya doesn't argue with JJ. "We should get going," says Alondo. "The Terebinth has room for all of us. I'm sure Tomek will find his own way to <planet>."`
	"CN-2674" `When you arrive at the quartermaster's building in the spaceport where the militia are gathering, you find that the rest of the Council has already found Tomek and are arguing with him in front of a silent crowd of militia officers who look as though they're watching their parents fighting.`
	"CN-2675" `	Tomek pauses for a moment, allowing JJ to step in. "We can discuss the consequences of Tomek's actions later. For now we need to focus on the situation at hand."`
	"CN-2676" `You arrive at the quartermaster's building in the spaceport where the militia are gathering. The Council are standing outside, along with a silent crowd of militia officers who look as though they've just watched their parents fighting.`
	"CN-2677" `	"Let's get inside," Tomek says, motioning for a number of militia officers to follow. As they file in, he also motions to you.`
	"CN-2678" `	(Go inside.)`
	"CN-2679" `	On the inside there is a large table with a map of the region at its center, much nicer than Tomek's map that he was using on Longjump. "Officer Sullivan, please give us a sitrep," JJ says.`
	"CN-2680" `	"Yes, sir. As the quartermaster of Deep, I have been monitoring the results of the early warning sensors installed on Hope by Captain <last>. For months now we would receive only the occasional ping of Navy ships entering the system, presumably scout fleets or fleets passing through the system from the western Dirt Belt to the east.`
	"CN-2681" `	"But starting within the past week, the number of Navy ships passing through the system began to rapidly increase. We went from seeing a fleet every few days to multiple per day, and those fleets that did enter often lingered for a longer amount of time for an unknown reason."`
	"CN-2682" `	"Whatever we're capable of, they're capable of and then some," says JJ. "I wouldn't be surprised if they know about our sensors and are trying to use them against us."`
	"CN-2683" `	"Captain <last> discovered a Navy Gunboat planting sensors of their own onto Hope when we installed ours," JJ says. "Surely they suspect that we have some as well."`
	"CN-2684" `	"They're trying to bait us," Tomek says. "Or they're distracting us."`
	"CN-2685" `	"Distracting us from what?" Alondo asks.`
	"CN-2686" `	Tomek thinks for a moment. "Have any of the eastern patrols returned yet?"`
	"CN-2687" `	"None," says an officer. "Most of our patrols have been sticking close to Tarazed to stay out of reach of the Navy. It'll take a few more days for them to begin arriving."`
	"CN-2688" `	"We could sure use those ships that were lost attacking Greenrock," Freya snips.`
	"CN-2689" `	Tomek ignores her. "Alright, Captain <last>, I want you to scout <waypoints>. Simply enter the systems, look at what forces the Navy has there, then leave as soon as possible. We need to know what we're up against, if the Navy truly are moving to attack from Wei. If it turns out this is a distraction, hopefully we'll have intel from the returning patrol fleets by then."`
	"CN-2690" `When you return, you find Tomek and JJ speaking with captains of the eastern patrols. The rest of the Council has been moved off-world in case the Navy retakes Kornephoros.`
	"CN-2691" `	"Welcome back, Captain," says Tomek. "I pray that your scouting mission went well."`
	"CN-2692" `	"Yes. The Navy didn't give me too much trouble passing through their systems."`
	"CN-2693" `	"The Navy gave me some difficulty, but I was able to pull through."`
	"CN-2694" `	You recall the strength of the Navy fleets to Tomek and JJ, mentioning the small fleets in Wei as well as the larger fleets in Alioth, Alphecca, and Seginus. "I also spotted a few Protectors in Navy colors," you add. "They were a part of the Navy fleets."`
	"CN-2695" `	"I thought we had an agreement that the Syndicate would not act as mercenaries for the Republic," JJ says.`
	"CN-2696" `	"They never said anything about selling supplies to the Republic," says Tomek. "They're doing the same for us, after all."`
	"CN-2697" `	"What's our next move?"`
	"CN-2698" `	"Have we learned anything from the patrols?"`
	"CN-2699" `	"The patrols tell us that the Navy presence to the east dropped recently," says Tomek. "Most of them are still there, but it was a big enough drop for our patrols to notice."`
	"CN-2700" `	"Apparently the Navy patrols and militia patrols in the eastern Dirt Belt are on friendly terms," says JJ. "No information sharing, of course, but they're not shooting at one another. Neither side has found it advantageous to attack the other; Navy patrols outgun ours and so our patrols don't provoke them, but if the Navy patrols drew our attention then they'd be easily cut off. Given that, we've been able to keep accurate head counts of each other in the east."`
	"CN-2701" `	"Which means they'll have noticed our own drop in presence there," says Tomek. "They know that we know that they're making moves to our north. Hopefully baiting us into recalling our patrols wasn't a part of their plan."`
	"CN-2702" `	"Well if our patrols are already friendly, perhaps we can talk ourselves out of another battle," says JJ.`
	"CN-2703" `	"<planet> has become something of a neutral zone," one of the militia officers jumps in, presumably one from the eastern patrols. "Navy and militia patrols pass each other by in the spaceport without incident. People from the Republic and Free Worlds who know each other meet there often. We could arrange a meeting there."`
	"CN-2704" `	"I'll travel there to speak with the Navy. Captain <last> shall be my transport," says JJ. "Tomek shall remain here with the fleet." Tomek nods in agreement. "Meeting dismissed."`
	"CN-2705" `	After the officers shuffle out, just you, JJ, and Tomek remain. JJ tells you to wait outside. "I want to speak with Tomek in private for a moment."`
	"CN-2706" `	You move outside the building and stand next to the doorway. From inside you can hear the mumbling of Tomek and JJ speaking. You could probably press your ear to the door to hear what's going on.`
	"CN-2707" `	(Step away so I don't hear anything.)`
	"CN-2708" `	(Eavesdrop on them.)`
	"CN-2709" `	"You will go peacefully to the Senate when this situation is handled, right, Tomek?" JJ asks.`
	"CN-2710" `	"I did what I had to, and I will not fight the punishment I receive," Tomek responds. "But it's up to you to not squander the opportunity I've provided us."`
	"CN-2711" `	"I'll do what I can," says JJ.`
	"CN-2712" `	You hear JJ walking toward the door and step away as to not be seen eavesdropping. He exits the building.`
	"CN-2713" `	Once they are done speaking, JJ exits the building.`
	"CN-2714" `	"Alright, let's move quickly," he says. "There's no telling when the Navy could attack. Chart a course for <destination>. I'll contact the Navy and arrange the meeting on our way there."`
	"CN-2715" `When you arrive, you see that the local Navy and Free Worlds soldiers have already gathered in the spaceport, keeping their distance from one another. News of the meeting must have already spread through the ranks. You see some civilians continuing to go about their day, while others are standing around watching the soldiers, but even with all the soldiers and civilians, the streets feel empty; perhaps many of the civilians that would normally be here have sought out shelter in fear of violence.`
	"CN-2716" `	JJ speaks with a Navy officer, asking him who he'll be meeting to negotiate with. "Commander Ranulph Hines, sir." The officer responds, seeming to catch himself up on calling JJ "sir." JJ has a look of concern on his face, but you don't think it's because of the Navy officer calling him "sir."`
	"CN-2717" `	"Is something wrong?"`
	"CN-2718" `	"Nothing," JJ responds, then pauses before saying, "I fear this won't end well."`
	"CN-2719" `	The officer directs you and JJ to an outdoor seating area of one of the spaceport's restaurants, where you find Commander Ranulph Hines finishing what looks like a plate of salmon. JJ sits down across from him.`
	"CN-2720" `	"Lieutenant Commander Jean-Jacques Soleau, in the flesh before my very eyes," Hines says, wiping the edges of his mouth. "I never imagined I'd be seeing you again after you so unceremoniously left the Navy."`
	"CN-2721" `	"I'm not here to discuss the past, Commander," JJ responds. "I'm here to prevent more bloodshed in this pointless war."`
	"CN-2722" `	"As am I, Soleau, as am I. Although I might ask, were the lives lost in your attacks on Geminus and Martini pointless, or were those necessary losses."`
	"CN-2723" `	"The Free Worlds are not responsible for those bombings," says JJ, sounding somewhat shaken. "We maintain our innocence, and were seeking to uncover who was responsible before the Republic ordered the Navy to take Kornephoros from us."`
	"CN-2724" `	"There was no 'taking,' Soleau. Kornephoros is rightfully Republic territory. We were simply enacting a police action on one of our own worlds, and arresting the terrorists who-"`
	"CN-2725" `	"So did you only come here to insult me and the Free Worlds or are you here to discuss peace as I asked?" JJ says, cutting Hines off. "As I said, I'm here to prevent more bloodshed. The deaths of those on Geminus and Martini as well as those in Kornephoros and Sabik were enough already. Continued bloodshed will not satisfy either side in this war."`
	"CN-2726" `	"Continued bloodshed like what occurred on Greenrock only days ago?" Hines quips. "I'm sure you are aware that the Navy cannot bring its full force upon the 'Free Worlds.' We have borders to patrol and piracy to tend to. You, on the other hand, have just shattered the biggest hub of piracy in the region, and I have no doubt that this has freed up many resources. It would appear to me that you yourselves are consolidating your forces for an offensive and further bloodshed despite your insistence to the opposite."`
	"CN-2727" `	"The actions that were taken on Greenrock were unsanctioned by the Free Worlds Senate or Council," JJ responds. "It was the result of rogue elements that have been taken care of."`
	"CN-2728" `	"Rogue elements within your ranks? You certainly have a history of those if it was a rogue element within your insurgency that committed the terrorist acts that took the lives of thousands of Republic citizens. At least, I presume it was a rogue element, as I've never known the venerable Jean-Jacques Soleau to be a liar, so I certainly believe you when you tell me that your 'Free Worlds' wouldn't do that. Although I'm sure you would have also told me that your 'Free Worlds' would never subjugate the population of Greenrock, either."`
	"CN-2729" `	"This guy doesn't seem too interested in peace talks. We should go."`
	"CN-2730" `	(Let JJ handle the situation.)`
	"CN-2731" `	You whisper your concerns to JJ. "No," he responds. "I can handle this."`
	"CN-2732" `	"So it would seem that the answer to my question is no," JJ says, raising his voice. "You're not interested in peace talks."`
	"CN-2733" `	"I am afraid so, Soleau. The Republic does not wish to lower itself to negotiating with terrorists. As such, I am ordering the arrest of you and every captain and crew member of the so-called 'Free Worlds' here for acts of terrorism and treason against the Republic."`
	"CN-2734" `	Some of the militia watching begin to reach for their weapons or move away as some Navy soldiers step forward, but JJ raises his hand to motion them to stop. The militia notice and hold their ground, as do the Navy soldiers. "Where is the Navy honor that we've all heard so much about?" JJ shouts loud enough for everyone watching to hear. "We come here with open arms asking for peace talks and you move to arrest us?" You hear jeers coming from some of the civilians watching.`
	"CN-2735" `	Hines turns up his nose. "This is undoubtedly Republic territory you're standing on, Soleau, and therefore we have every right to arrest you."`
	"CN-2736" `	"I think your men disagree," JJ remarks. All of the Navy personnel have either remained in or returned to formation. "Remember that I myself was a part of the Navy once. A Navy that each and every one of your honored men surely remember, either because they lived it or because they grew up revering it. But a Navy that I left because of those like you. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but if we can't negotiate peace talks then we'll be leaving. I pray that you'll be wise enough to see the error in your ways and let us go." JJ stands up and begins walking off, leaving Hines to sulk in his chair.`
	"CN-2737" `	"Your days are numbered, Soleau," Hines shouts, but he remains in his chair and gives no orders to his soldiers.`
	"CN-2738" `	The Navy allows you to leave unmolested as you enter your ship with JJ. "Launch your ship immediately and return to <planet>," he says. "The only thing that rivals honor among the Navy is duty, and I don't want to be around when Hines starts whipping his men into his shape."`
	"CN-2739" `When you return, Tomek is busy preparing the fleet. It looks like most of the ships are ready to go, with some already starting their engines. "I take it the peace talks didn't work out," he says.`
	"CN-2740" `	"Not quite," says JJ. "Although I think we won a small victory in another way."`
	"CN-2741" `	"You'll have to tell me later," Tomek says, beginning to shout as ships around you begin to take off. "Captain <last>, get your ship ready for the air. Our sensors tell us there's a massive Navy fleet in <system>. They could jump in here any hour now. I've ordered a preemptive strike; we're going to rush into <system> and take them head on before they can reach our territory. Detain any surviving Navy personnel on <planet> and we'll send in transports to either ferry them back to the Republic if they agree to join the Oathkeepers, or to Bourne if they refuse. Now get going. We have no time to waste."`
	"CN-2742" `JJ and Freya meet you soon after you land on <origin>. "Great work in the battle, Captain," Freya says. "Unfortunately, we can't delay the outcome of your attack on Greenrock any longer."`
	"CN-2743" `	JJ says, "You have been suspended from your service to the Free Worlds by order of the Free Worlds Council, and are commanded to report to <planet> for a Senate hearing within the next two weeks. There, the Senate will decide your fate. If you do not report for your hearing, your service will be terminated."`
	"CN-2744" `	"It's been an honor serving with you."`
	"CN-2745" `	"What's happened to Tomek?"`
	"CN-2746" `	"You've been a good soldier," JJ says. "May you return to us in time. Goodbye, Captain."`
	"CN-2747" `	"Tomek is on his way to the Senate right now," Freya says. "He left as soon as the news of the victory arrived. I imagine his Senate hearing will have occurred by the time you reach <planet>." She pauses. "Goodbye, Captain."`
	"CN-2748" `With some trepidation, you enter the Senate building and introduce yourself to the receptionist. He says, "Please wait here. Someone will come for you when they are ready."`
	"CN-2749" `	Several hours pass. Finally, you are led into the Senate chamber, where several dozen senators sit, each with a name card identifying the world they represent. Senator Huygens of Mere asks the first question. "Captain <last>, is it true that you took part in a recent unauthorized attack on Greenrock in the Shaula system?"`
	"CN-2750" `	"Yes, that is correct."`
	"CN-2751" `	"I was following orders from Tomek, from the Council."`
	"CN-2752" `	"I didn't ask what your excuse is," she says. "I asked whether you took part in the attack."`
	"CN-2753" `	"Yes, I did," you say.`
	"CN-2754" `	"Were you aware at the time that you were going against the orders of the Senate?"`
	"CN-2755" `	"No, I was led to believe that I was following the Senate's orders."`
	"CN-2756" `	"Interesting," says Arianna. "That's not what Tomek told us. And JJ and Freya both said that you were well aware of the Senate's wishes."`
	"CN-2757" `	One of the other senators, an older man, asks, "Why did you choose to take part in the attack?"`
	"CN-2758" `	"I wanted to do something to end the pirate threat."`
	"CN-2759" `	"I trusted that Tomek would know the best strategy."`
	"CN-2760" `	"I guess I got too caught up in trying to be a hero."`
	"CN-2761" `	"And how did that work out?" says the old man. "Shortly after your attack on Greenrock, the Navy made moves to invade us once again, a plan that was no doubt helped by your actions."`
	"CN-2762" `	"Indeed," says the senator. "And I bet it wasn't long after the battle that you realized saving the galaxy isn't that easy."`
	"CN-2763" `	"I suppose so," you admit.`
	"CN-2764" `	A third senator speaks up, a woman whose name card identifies her as Sara, from Skymoot. "That will be all, Captain <last>. The Senate will confer and decide whether we want your continued services."`
	"CN-2765" `	You are led back out to the lobby, where you wait for what feels like another hour. During that time, you speak with someone else and learn that Tomek has been removed from the Council and put under house arrest. Although interestingly, despite Tomek disobeying orders, the Senate has decided to continue the occupation of Greenrock, at least for now, because it would "dishonor those who lost their lives doing what they believed to be right" to leave the planet so quickly.`
	"CN-2766" `	Finally, a messenger comes and hands you a small slip of paper. You open it. The message reads: "We have decided that you will be suspended without pay and stripped of your rank. When we are in need of your services again, we will contact you, and your rank will be reinstated as the Senate or Council sees fit." It looks like for now, you are back to being a simple merchant captain.`
	"CN-2767" `JJ and Freya meet you soon after you land on <origin>. "Great work in the battle, Captain," Freya says. "Unfortunately, we now need to turn our attention to cleaning up Tomek's mess."`
	"CN-2768" `	"The people of Thule became wary of our deal with them after Tomek's attack on Greenrock," JJ explains. "They feared that they would be next, and that our negotiations with them were just an attempt to get them to distance themselves from what would be their main line of defense."`
	"CN-2769" `	"We have to show them that our offer was genuine," Freya says.`
	"CN-2770" `	"How are we going to do that?"`
	"CN-2771" `	"So what happens to Tomek now?"`
	"CN-2772" `	"Tomek is on his way to Bourne right now," Freya says. "He left as soon as the news of the victory arrived. I imagine we'll know the outcome of his Senate hearing once you've returned from your mission."`
	"CN-2773" `	"What mission?" you ask.`
	"CN-2774" `	"Well, thanks to you, the Men system is no longer engaged in piracy," says JJ. "And that means the folks on Smuggler's Den are in need of new work. That station used to be a deuterium refinery. With a little work, it can be one, again."`
	"CN-2775" `	"A working refinery could bring more income to that system than piracy ever did, and helping to repair it would show the people of Thule that we mean them no harm," says Freya. "Only problem is, the replacement parts are rare, and hard to come by. The Syndicate agreed to sell us the parts, but only if we meet them halfway, on <planet>. That's in the <system> system. Just one jump away from one of the major new Navy bases."`
	"CN-2776" `	"We're going to take a supply convoy through Republic space?"`
	"CN-2777" `	"How do we know this isn't a trap?"`
	"CN-2778" `	"We don't," says Freya, "but the Syndicate has helped us before, and they are always willing to make deals. I don't think they're ready to give up on the chance to sell their wares to both sides in this war just yet."`
	"CN-2779" `	"Still, how do they expect us to get a convoy safely to Tundra?" you ask`
	"CN-2780" `	"Not a convoy," says JJ. "Just you, Captain. It's only ten tons of spare parts. Your job is to fly to Tundra, retrieve the parts, and return here."`
	"CN-2781" `	"I'll do my best."`
	"CN-2782" `	"I hope this doesn't turn out to be a suicide mission."`
	"CN-2783" `	"I hope so too," says Freya. "If your ship has enough fuel capacity, you might try flying over to the neutral territory of Dabih or Tarazed, and then up to Cebalrai from there, to avoid the worst of the Navy patrols. Good luck, Captain. If anyone can do it, you can."`
	"CN-2784" `Your landing site is an abandoned settlement a thousand kilometers from <origin>'s main spaceport. It's an old oil field that ran dry decades ago, and only a few of the landing pads are still usable. The Syndicate employees quickly load the cargo onto your ship, and say, "Now, take off quickly, before the Navy sees us doing business with a ship flying Free Worlds colors."`
	"CN-2785" `After unloading the supplies, you send Freya and JJ a message letting them know that you arrived safely with the refinery equipment. Locals work alongside Free Worlds militia members to throw out the old, rusted hardware and install the new equipment. It will likely take a few days for everything to get up and running again, but the people of this system seem eager to get back to more honest work.`
	"CN-2786" `	At the end of the day you receive a response from JJ. "Great work, Captain! This gesture will go a long way. With a great blow being dealt to the Navy, I doubt they'll come for us any time soon, and with our relationship with Thule repaired, I'm sure piracy will be at its lowest in years in this region. Thanks to our successes, we don't have any more work for you at the moment. We'll call upon you in the future when you're needed, but in the mean time you could help our officers with the occasional odd job. They've been posting on job boards around the Free Worlds looking for help from militia captains with spare time. Or you could just take time to relax if you need it. War can be taxing on the soul. Rest if you need to.`
	"CN-2787" `	"Before I sign off, I should also mention that I've just learned of the Senate's decision on Tomek. He's been removed from the Council and placed under house arrest until further notice. Furthermore, the Senate has decided that the occupation of Greenrock will continue, at least for now. Although they disagree with Tomek's disobedience, it seems he convinced the Senate during his hearing that holding Greenrock would provide a tactical advantage. Let's pray that this is the right decision to make.`
	"CN-2788" `	"Goodbye, Captain. Stay well."`
	"CN-2789" `	After months of just traveling around following other people's orders, it feels odd to be left to your own devices for a change.`
	"CN-2790" `After you land, you notice that a sizable crowd has gathered around a video screen near the edge of the <origin> spaceport. You approach to find out what's going on. You're about to ask someone what's happening when you overhear Tomek's voice coming from the screen. You look up to see a video of Tomek standing atop a Free Worlds warship and addressing an unseen crowd.`
	"CN-2791" `	"For generations we have been neglected by the Republic!" he shouts. "Our grievances were ignored! Our pain and suffering was ignored! Our needs were ignored! We cried out for help, and yet the Republic did nothing, allowing our planets to be ravaged by piracy while continuing to tax our credits for services we were not provided. And as the years have gone on the pirates have only become more and more emboldened.`
	"CN-2792" `	"We tried our best, even with the system stacked against us. Councilor Katya Reynolds and others like her spoke on the behalf of billions within the South, Rim, and Dirt Belt. On behalf of us. On behalf of our brothers and sisters, our fathers and mothers, our sons and daughters. And they spat in her face! And when they did that, they spat in our faces!`
	"CN-2793" `	"And so we banded together. Friends and family locked in arms, doing that which the Republic would not. We looked out for each other, and raised our own defenses against the piracy that we so feared. And then we stood up together and told the Republic that we would take their neglect no longer. We shouted that the system does not work, and so we will create our own! We, with the sweat, blood, and tears of generations, birthed these Free Worlds!`
	"CN-2794" `	"And how does the Republic respond to this? They have finally given us the attention we've asked, but not in the form we desired. They have attacked us! Waged war on us! And in doing so, Katya has become a prisoner of war, held for crimes she did not commit by a system that did not listen to her despite her greatest attempts to be heard."`
	"CN-2795" `	"Is this live?"`
	"CN-2796" `	"I don't know," a man next to you says. "It was playing the news like usual when suddenly this came on."`
	"CN-2797" `	You look back up to Tomek. "Yet even now our struggle does not end. Our new system is already beginning to fail us. I tell you now that the Free Worlds Senate has decided that instead of fighting piracy, they will negotiate with them instead! They will attempt to negotiate with those most known in this galaxy for lying and backstabbing and swindling. Those most known for not following the laws of the Republic, and who will undoubtedly refuse to follow the laws of these Free Worlds.`
	"CN-2798" `	"And so I make my plea to you, to those who fight for those who cannot, to join me in arms to give the pirates what they rightfully deserve! For inflicting so much pain upon us! For enslaving and killing our friends and family! For ruining our lives and businesses! For making us live in terror and fear! Who will join me to put an end to it all?"`
	"CN-2799" `	The crowd on the video can be heard cheering, and some of the crowd around you even cheers along with them.`
	"CN-2800" `	The screen then changes from the video of Tomek to a picture of a news clipping talking about Tomek's house arrest, with words flashing on the screen: "He fought for us, and for that they put him down." A symbol of three green wolves howling at a full moon appears, then the screen fades to black. A few seconds later the recording repeats, showing Tomek stepping up onto the top of a Free Worlds warship. "Captains and crew of the Free Worlds. Merchants of the Free Worlds. People of the Free Worlds. Please give me your attention. I have a plea, a cry for help that has gone unanswered.`
	"CN-2801" `	"For generations we have been neglected by the Republic! Our grievances..." The video continues as you saw it. You leave the crowd, not quite sure what to make of this situation.`
	"CN-2802" `As you are landing, you receive a message from JJ, on behalf of the Council. The message reads:`
	"CN-2803" `	Captain <last>, sorry that we have been out of contact. We need your help once again, to assist in a diplomatic mission. Please meet up with Alondo on <planet> as soon as possible. He will give you more information.`
	"CN-2804" `	Captain <last>. Your suspension from the Free Worlds has just ended. The Senate is still not happy with what you did, and has therefore not reinstated your pay, but they have allowed you to continue working for us. Don't cause any more issues and you'll regain your pay. Please meet up with Alondo on <planet> as soon as possible. He will give you more information.`
	"CN-2805" `			Sincerely,`
	"CN-2806" `				Jean-Jacques and Freya`
	"CN-2807" `You meet up with Alondo, who insists on not telling you anything until you are safely back aboard your own ship. Once you have brought him to his room, he says, "Here's the deal. The Senate has been secretly reaching out to other worlds, and four of them have decided to join us: Harmony, New Portland, Dancer, and New India."`
	"CN-2808" `	"That's great news!"`
	"CN-2809" `	"Why haven't I heard of this yet?"`
	"CN-2810" `	"Indeed it is," says Alondo. "Any worlds joining us would be reason to celebrate, but these four are particularly important because they are on the trade route to Tarazed. If we control those systems, our supply convoys will be much safer."`
	"CN-2811" `	"Why isn't this public knowledge yet?" you ask.`
	"CN-2812" `	"Well," says Alondo, "apparently the Senate was not being as secretive as they thought. Somehow word leaked out to the Republic that those worlds were defecting, and a massive Navy fleet moved to occupy those systems. Which means we're on the brink of another bloody battle."`
	"CN-2813" `	"Don't worry, I'm sure we can defeat them."`
	"CN-2814" `	"Is there any way to avoid a fight?"`
	"CN-2815" `	"I'm sure we can," says Alondo, "but with heavy loss of life on both sides. We want to avoid that if at all possible. That's where you come in."`
	"CN-2816" `	"That's what we're hoping," he says, "and that's where you come in."`
	"CN-2817" `	"How so?" you ask.`
	"CN-2818" `	He says, "We've arranged for you to be granted safe passage through Republic space for the next three weeks. That's enough time to bring me to Earth and back. If I can meet with Parliament in person, maybe I will be able to work something out."`
	"CN-2819" `	"Okay, let's go to Earth!"`
	"CN-2820" `	"How do we know this isn't a trap? You're willing to risk your life for this?"`
	"CN-2821" `	"If we can save thousands of lives from being lost in a needless battle, it's worth the risk," he says. "Now come on, the clock is ticking. We need to be safely back in Free space before your safe passage expires."`
	"CN-2822" `You drop off Alondo and wish him luck. Hours pass, and you begin to worry that he has been taken prisoner or killed. But finally he returns, looking very discouraged. "It makes no sense," he says. "The tax revenue they get from those four worlds doesn't come close to covering the cost of defending them. They should be glad to let them go."`
	"CN-2823" `	"So, Parliament won't give up those worlds without a fight?"`
	"CN-2824" `	"Maybe they're afraid of the precedent it would set if they give in to us."`
	"CN-2825" `	"That's right," he says. "Amazing how heedless they can be, sitting in their comfy Parliament house deciding the fates of others."`
	"CN-2826" `	"Yes, that seems to be what's at stake," he says. "But by now they should see the writing on the wall. Amazing how callous they can be about the lives of the Navy crews who are following their orders."`
	"CN-2827" `	"So, we just head home in defeat?" you ask.`
	"CN-2828" `	"Not quite," he says. "While we have the chance, I want to talk with the Navy leadership directly. Landing near the secret base on New Austria would be way too provocative, so I've arranged to meet with them on their base on <planet> instead."`
	"CN-2829" `	"Okay, if that's what it takes to avoid another bloody battle, I'll take you there."`
	"CN-2830" `	"Are you insane? Flying straight into the largest Navy base in the sector?"`
	"CN-2831" `	"Don't worry," he says. "The Navy takes honor very seriously. If they promise our safety, we'll be safe. At least until that grant of safe passage expires, that is." You have serious doubts, but you have no choice but to obey him.`
	"CN-2832" `When you land on <origin>, Alondo says, "You should join me for this meeting. You may find it eye-opening."`
	"CN-2833" `	Four of the Navy admirals who are stationed here have agreed to meet with you. You discover that one of them is from the Dirt Belt. Another grew up in the Rim, and admits to you that if he were not serving the Navy, he would be fighting for the Free Worlds. All four of them seem sympathetic to your cause, and express genuine regret not just for the Navy lives that have been lost, but for the Free Worlds losses as well.`
	"CN-2834" `	And all four of them state, without any hesitation or equivocation, that if Parliament orders them to continue to fight the Free Worlds, they will fight until all possibility of victory is gone.`
	"CN-2835" `	Alondo thanks them for their time and their honesty, and you return to your ship. "Well, it was worth a try. Now we just have to get home safely," he says.`
	"CN-2836" `Alondo and JJ are in a somber mood when you meet up with them in the bar. You can't help remembering that Tomek always used to be a part of these gatherings, before he turned against the Senate. And now it looks like your next major battle will be fought without Tomek's expert guidance.`
	"CN-2837" `	JJ says, "We've done all we can. Sooner or later we will have to fight the Navy for those star systems. So to start with, <first>, we'd like you to scout them out and report back to us on the Navy's presence there. Freya is on Trinket, gathering a fleet. Report to her there when you're done."`
	"CN-2838" `Freya thanks you for performing the scouting mission, and you give her a copy of your ship's logs to analyze. As she looks through them, almost immediately something catches her eye. "Looks like the Navy is fielding some new weapons," she says. "Some higher-yield torpedoes, and a beam weapon even more powerful than Heavy Lasers. Those beam weapons in particular worry me."`
	"CN-2839" `	"Yes, that kind of negates the advantage I was hoping we'd have due to our new plasma turrets."`
	"CN-2840" `	"Does that mean we're not going to attack them after all?"`
	"CN-2841" `	"Well," she says, "the Plasma Turrets weren't the only ace up our sleeve, but still, it's frustrating that the Navy still has such an advantage over us technologically."`
	"CN-2842" `	"What should we do?" you ask.`
	"CN-2843" `	"We're going to have to fight them eventually, but first we need as much information as we can get on their new weapon systems. I'd like you to find one of their Gunboats that has the new electron beams installed, steal one of them, and bring it back here. I imagine one of them can't be much bigger than twenty or thirty tons, so you ought to be able to find space for it. Think you can do that?"`
	"CN-2844" `	"How can I find a Gunboat that's all by itself? They're usually a part of a bigger fleet."`
	"CN-2845" `	"I already plundered one of these new guns previously. I can give it to you now."`
	"CN-2846" `	"I already plundered one of these new turrets previously. I can give it to you now."`
	"CN-2847" `	She thinks about that for a moment, then says, "The Navy has shifted most of their capital ships to the defecting systems in the south. That means that some of the systems up north will have lighter defenses. You might try Wei or Alnasl. Good luck, Captain."`
	"CN-2848" `	"Oh! That's great to hear. I'll get my team to take it off your hands right away."`
	"CN-2849" `	You hand off the weapon to Freya's science team once they arrive. Freya tells you that she'll be waiting for you in a cafe in the spaceport after she's had a chance to look at it more closely.`
	"CN-2850" `While refueling on <planet>, a Free Worlds captain approaches you. "Captain <last>, I hear you're on the search for one of those new lasers the Navy is using."`
	"CN-2851" `	"Yes, I am."`
	"CN-2852" `	"Do you have any information on them?"`
	"CN-2853" `	"Good, because we have some information that could help you.`
	"CN-2854" `	"We've had to stop all scouting parties into Republic space because of the strength of these new weapons, so we're flying in the dark on where the Navy is, but luckily we have received word from sympathizers in the Dirt Belt. The Navy has gathered forces with these new weapons in Alioth and Seginus, frequently entering the Wei system.`
	"CN-2855" `	"They haven't been coming into Kornephoros, so they're likely just patrolling the area to dissuade us from making any sudden moves. This means that Wei likely isn't your best bet for stealing a weapon given the traffic, but I hear that things aren't much better beyond Lesath. I wish we had some ships to spare to help you, but we just don't have that kind of freedom right now."`
	"CN-2856" `	You thank the Captain for the information and he wishes you good luck.`
	"CN-2857" `You decide to scan the Navy ships entering and exiting the system by tapping into the surveillance rigs that you helped Freya set up so long ago. Many of the Navy ships are armed with these new Electron Beams, but they are appearing in fleets too big to take on alone. You notice though that almost all Navy traffic is to and from Alioth and Seginus, while only lone Gunboats are traveling to and from Alnasl. Perhaps you may be able to ambush one of these smaller ships on its own in Alnasl.`
	"CN-2858" `Because this world is a tourist destination, there are innumerable fancy cafes in the spaceport. You meet up with Freya in one of the smaller ones. "Thank you for acquiring that weapon sample for us," she says. "It's typical Republic weaponry: far more efficient than anything we're able to make, and very well designed. My engineers were kind of in awe as they disassembled it."`
	"CN-2859" `	"Do you have any tactical advice on fighting ships with one of those installed?"`
	"CN-2860" `	"Is there any chance we can reverse engineer it and build our own?"`
	"CN-2861" `	"Well," she says, "its range is very slightly shorter than our Plasma Turrets. You might be able to use that to your advantage if you can position your ship just right so that you can hit an enemy target but they can't hit you. You may find that useful in the upcoming battle."`
	"CN-2862" `	"Maybe, although we haven't even mastered the art of building Heavy Lasers yet," she says. "We certainly won't have time before the upcoming battle."`
	"CN-2863" `	"So we're definitely going to attack the Navy?" you ask.`
	"CN-2864" `	"We have no choice," she says. "We tried diplomacy. If we don't show a willingness to support new worlds that want to join us, or if we don't seem to have enough strength to defend them, some of those that have joined us already may start to return to the Republic."`
	"CN-2865" `	"Okay, I'm ready to fight."`
	"CN-2866" `	"I wish it hadn't come to this, but if you think it's our only option, I'll join the fight."`
	"CN-2867" `	"Thank you," she says. "But there's one more thing we must do to prepare for battle. I mentioned before that we have an ace up our sleeve. It's a new warship designed by Southbound Shipyards, intended to be a match for a Cruiser. They've only finished building three of them. I'd like you to travel to Zug and escort them back here. Once you return, we'll prepare for battle."`
	"CN-2868" `When you land on <origin>, a Southbound Shipyards executive leads you to a hangar. The hangar is huge, but it clearly was not meant to hold a ship as large as the one it now contains. There is barely enough space for the cranes and catwalks being used by the construction crews.`
	"CN-2869" `	"The Dreadnought is a new design, the largest ship we've ever built. Only three of them have been completed so far." The size of the Dreadnought is impressive: as bulky as a Cruiser, it looks like a cross between a Bastion and an Argosy freighter. After giving you a moment to take in the view, he leads you out to a section of the spaceport where three Dreadnoughts are parked. Next to them, and looking tiny by comparison, are five Furies. You ask, "Are those Furies part of the battle fleet, too?"`
	"CN-2870" `	"Yes," he says, "equipped with some fancy new weapons from Barmy Edward up at Kraz Cybernetics that he said you helped test. I haven't seen them in action yet, but he's convinced they'll be useful against the Navy."`
	"CN-2871" `	"Yes," he says, "equipped with some fancy new weapons from Barmy Edward up at Kraz Cybernetics that he recently finished working on. He said they should be entering mass production soon. Flamethrowers, the crazy bastard. I haven't seen them in action yet, but he's convinced they'll be useful against the Navy."`
	"CN-2872" `	You thank him for his time, and meet up with the captains of the battle fleet, arranging for them to follow you back to Trinket.`
	"CN-2873" `When you meet up with Freya in the cafe, she looks like she hasn't slept in several days. "I can't believe we're headed for another major battle," she says. "I keep hoping the Navy will just pull back and not force us to fight them."`
	"CN-2874" `	"It doesn't seem likely that Parliament would allow that."`
	"CN-2875" `	"Yes, their sense of honor can be inspiring at times, but right now it's annoying."`
	"CN-2876" `	"Indeed," she says. "Although, based on what Alondo said, the Navy hinted that if we made such a show of force that there was no way they could win the battle, they could honorably choose to retreat. So, if they start trying to retreat, let them go. But I suspect it will be a difficult battle to win."`
	"CN-2877" `	"What's the battle plan?" you ask.`
	"CN-2878" `	"The fleet from Southbound Shipyards will be traveling with you," she says. "Other fleets with other commanders will be converging on Rastaban separately, at approximately the same time. So, you have no time to lose. You must travel directly to Rastaban from here, or else you will arrive too late to join in the fight. Good luck, captain."`
	"CN-2879" `As soon as you land on <origin>, you contact Freya and let her know that the system is yours. "That's great news," she says. "Now we need to make sure they've pulled back from the neighboring systems, too. Take a few ships and sweep through Delta Sagittarii and Albaldah and make sure they're clear. Leave the rest of the fleet on Dancer to handle the prisoners and repairs."`
	"CN-2880" `	"What should I do if I encounter Navy ships on my patrol?"`
	"CN-2881" `	"What are we going to do with the prisoners?"`
	"CN-2882" `	"If they're fleeing, let them flee," she says, "but if you discover a strong Navy presence remaining in one of those systems, report back to Dancer before engaging them. Meanwhile, I'll ask Alondo to contact the Navy admirals and see if we can get Katya back in exchange for those prisoners."`
	"CN-2883" `	"Well," she says, "my hope is that we can trade them for any of our people who have been captured so far in this war. Including Katya."`
	"CN-2884" `	"You think she's still alive?" you ask.`
	"CN-2885" `	"Certainly, and having this many Navy prisoners gives us a great bargaining chip for negotiating her freedom. Now, gather your patrol, and by the time you get back, I hope we will have arranged for her release."`
	"CN-2886" `You find Freya and Alondo watching over a large hangar where several hundred Navy crew and support staff are being kept under guard. Alondo says, "I contacted the Navy admirals. They say Katya is not under their control; she is a prisoner of the Intelligence bureau, and arranging her release could take weeks. But they promised that if we return their prisoners now, they will ensure Katya's release and return her to us soon."`
	"CN-2887" `	"How do we know they won't break that promise?"`
	"CN-2888" `	"Why not just keep the prisoners until we have Katya back safely?"`
	"CN-2889" `	Freya sighs. "Alondo claims that the admirals value their honor so highly that we can trust their promise. I am not so sure. Even if the admirals do their best, what if Intelligence refuses to honor the deal we make?"`
	"CN-2890" `	Alondo says, "On the other hand, if we release these prisoners on parole as a gesture of good faith, it could bring us much closer to a diplomatic end to this war. Which would be far preferable to another battle as bloody as this one."`
	"CN-2891" `	Freya says, "And meanwhile, JJ is off on a top secret mission. And that means he's not available to consult with, and we need to make this decision now."`
	"CN-2892" `	"And since we cannot agree," says Alondo, "we are giving you the deciding vote."`
	"CN-2893" `	"What do you mean?"`
	"CN-2894" `	"We will be putting you in charge of the prisoner convoy," says Alondo, "and arranging a week of safe passage for you. If you think we should return the prisoners as a gesture of goodwill to improve our chances of a diplomatic end to this war, bring the convoy to <planet>."`
	"CN-2895" `	"But if you think we should hold on to the prisoners until we receive Katya safely back," says Freya, "bring the convoy to Clink. Understand?"`
	"CN-2896" `	It's a serious choice facing you, with no clear right decision. You thank them for trusting you, and begin preparations to escort the prisoners.`
	"CN-2897" `<origin> has become the home of a major Navy base almost overnight; the number of ships and people here is almost overwhelming. You return the prisoners, who have all taken an oath of parole to take no further part in the war against the Free Worlds. One of the four Navy admirals who you and Alondo met with earlier is here, and as you are unloading the prisoners, he says, "More volunteers for the 'Oathkeepers,' I see."`
	"CN-2898" `	"Who are the 'Oathkeepers'?"`
	"CN-2899" `	"The officers you granted parole to months ago. We reassigned them all to duty in the north, patrolling for pirates."`
	"CN-2900" `	"You mean they really do honor their promise not to fight us?" you ask.`
	"CN-2901" `	"Of course. They swore a vow, after all." You suspect it's not quite that simple, but decide that questioning this admiral's word would be pointless. As you are getting ready to leave, he says, "Don't worry, we will be returning Miss Reynolds to you shortly. The ship carrying her should arrive here in a week or two."`
	"CN-2902" `	You hope he is telling the truth. Now, it is time to meet with Freya and Alondo and decide what should be done next.`
	"CN-2903" `You drop off the prisoners at the mines of Clink, to be held until the Navy returns Katya to you. Now, it's time to meet with Freya and Alondo and decide what should be done next.`
	"CN-2904" `You land on Dancer and report to Alondo and Freya that the prisoner transfer is complete. "What do we do now?" you ask.`
	"CN-2905" `	Freya says, "Well, I hope we're done with fighting for a while, now. We'll stay here to hold this system against any Navy retaliation. And, we'll keep hoping that Parliament might come to their senses and agree to a diplomatic end to this conflict. In the meantime I suggest you spend some time doing whatever it is you do to earn money on the side - carrying passengers or freight or hunting pirates. We'll contact you when things begin to move forward again."`
	"CN-2906" `	"Sounds good. I'll hope to hear from you soon."`
	"CN-2907" `	"You're sure there's nothing else I can do to help the Free Worlds right now?"`
	"CN-2908" `	Alondo says, "You might hear from some other folks who could use your assistance, but as for the Council, I think it's a waiting game for us right now. Please don't think we aren't grateful for your help, Captain. All we're saying is that hopefully, for a few months at least, we'll all be able to take a break from fighting and go back to actually living our lives."`
	"CN-2909" `	"Before you leave, Captain," Freya says. "The Senate has decided to reinstate your pay after these recent events. You should now have a salary of 2,100 credits, just like before."`
	"CN-2910" `	Alondo gives you a nod. "We'll contact you as soon as things get interesting again."`
	"CN-2911" `Soon after you land on <origin>, you receive a message from Freya: "Greetings, Captain <last>! I hope you've made good use of your time off, because we're about to be right in the thick of it once again. As soon as you're able, please come rejoin the fleet on Dancer. We have some urgent and sensitive work to do."`
	"CN-2912" `When you land on Dancer, the Free Worlds fleet appears to be preparing for another battle: missiles and torpedoes are being loaded onto ships and crew members are running around. You eventually find Freya and Alondo, and ask them what is going on.`
	"CN-2913" `	"Another three worlds have secretly told us they are ready to defect," says Alondo, "and this time around we want to get there before the Navy does."`
	"CN-2914" `	Freya says, "We need you to take Alondo, along with the ships that we've been able to muster, and fly through the <waypoints> systems, then land on <destination>. If all goes well, you will get through to <planet> before the Republic can muster reinforcements. Drive off any Republic ships you encounter along the way."`
	"CN-2915" `As soon as you land, Alondo rushes out of your ship to meet with the governor of <planet> and "get these papers signed before they change their minds." He tells you to meet him back in the spaceport in an hour.`
	"CN-2916" `You wait in the spaceport bar for a while. Your Free Worlds uniform has drawn a good deal of attention from the locals: a few of them waved to you when you came in, or gave other subtle signs of approval, but no one is sitting with you. They probably want to avoid getting into trouble with the Republic if the Free Worlds are not able to hold this planet.`
	"CN-2917" `	Finally Alondo arrives. "Come on," he says. "Let's talk outside." He seems tired, but not frightened.`
	"CN-2918" `	"Is everything okay?"`
	"CN-2919" `	"Did they agree to join us?"`
	"CN-2920" `	"Yes, yes, of course," he says. "But taking on six more worlds all of a sudden - I just hope it's not more than we can handle. When the Navy recovers from the battle at Rastaban and strikes back, now we have much less idea where that strike will fall."`
	"CN-2921" `	"We need to move more of our fleet up here to the front," he says, "but I'd be willing to bet that the Navy has installed surveillance equipment on Hope, and maybe a few other planets in this sector too. Which I should have thought of before, because in order to be sure we've tracked every last one down, we need Freya's expertise in signals and sensors. So, I'm sending you to meet up with her on Dancer."`
	"CN-2922" `	"No problem. Don't worry, we'll be able to handle this just fine."`
	"CN-2923" `	"Aren't you afraid the Navy will strike while I'm off fetching her?"`
	"CN-2924" `	"Of course," he says. "But I talked with JJ, and he thinks they're still recovering from the last battle. And if their sensors all go dark, that will be a big deterrent to keep them from attacking - certainly more of a deterrent than you could add by staying here with our fleet."`
	"CN-2925" `	"Understood," you say. "I'll go get Freya."`
	"CN-2926" `As soon as you land, Freya shows up at your ship with a small suitcase full of clothes. "No time to waste," she says. "Let's get going. Our first target will be <planet>, since we know for a fact that they were installing something there."`
	"CN-2927" `As you approach the planet, Freya sits down at your ship's sensor console and begins fiddling with some settings that you didn't even know existed. She seems entirely focused, and clearly knows what she is doing. You recall being told that she is an engineer, not a politician or a military commander, which makes the fact that she has been able to step up as such a strong leader in the Council very impressive.`
	"CN-2928" `	"Yup, eight different stations," she says finally, "including this one that I nearly overlooked, buried ten meters under the ice, that is acting as a relay for them." She points out each station on your map, and you fly by each one and destroy it. "Now," she says, "that was what had me most worried, but for the sake of completeness we should sweep the other new worlds, too. Let's go to <planet> next."`
	"CN-2929" `Once again, Freya works some sort of magic with your ship's sensors and manages to locate another surveillance station. "Right in the middle of the city," she says. "We'll have to go there on foot and disable it."`
	"CN-2930" `	"Are you worried that it might be guarded?"`
	"CN-2931" `	"Okay, I'll grab my favorite guns and explosives!"`
	"CN-2932" `	"A little worried," she says. "We should be armed, just in case. But I'm not picking up any human heat signatures from the building, and it wouldn't be like the Navy to leave some of their own behind for us to capture."`
	"CN-2933" `	"Now, now," she says, "we just convinced this world to join us, let's not go blowing up their whole factory district. I don't see any human heat signatures, but you can bring your weapons anyway just in case."`
	"CN-2934" `	Warily, you approach the sensor installation, kicking down the door to an old abandoned warehouse. Freya is right - it's not guarded. She shuts down the transmitter, then asks for your help bringing some of the sensors and other equipment back to your ship. "I always love having a chance to look at Navy technology," she says. "Now, let's head to <planet>."`
	"CN-2935" `You spend quite a while flying back and forth above the surface of <origin>, but Freya is unable to locate any Navy signals originating from the surface. Finally she gives up. "It's an out-of-the-way planet," she says. "Any fleet coming here would pass through Alioth or Seginus first. So I guess they didn't bother to put anything here. Time to head to New Tibet and meet up with Alondo!"`
	"CN-2936" `As you approach <origin>, Freya quickly locates two Navy surveillance stations and contacts Alondo, asking him to send some Free Worlds personnel to destroy them. Then you land, and Alondo comes aboard your ship to discuss your next steps in person.`
	"CN-2937" `	"There's a good chance we've taken care of all the sensors in this sector," says Freya, "so we can start moving our fleets around here without tipping the Navy off. And I just heard from Southbound Shipyards that they've got two more Dreadnoughts ready for service."`
	"CN-2938" `	"Only two? I was hoping to get a Dreadnought of my own soon!"`
	"CN-2939" `	"Don't we need to defend Rastaban and the other systems to the east, as well?"`
	"CN-2940" `	"Patience, Captain," says Freya. "Building prototypes is very different from doing mass production."`
	"CN-2941" `	"Yes," says Freya. "Which means our fleets will be stretched thin. We really need them to ramp up Dreadnought production."`
	"CN-2942" `	Alondo asks Freya, "Do you think you could help them in the shipyards? After all, you were a superb fleet supply manager back in the Defense Pact days."`
	"CN-2943" `	"I'll do what I can, if you think you're all set here," says Freya.`
	"CN-2944" `	"I'm fine," says Alondo, "and JJ is on Rastaban now, guarding our other flank. So you can take a break from being on the front." He heads back outside, and you and Freya get ready to visit the shipyards on <planet>.`
	"CN-2945" `As you are landing on <planet>, Freya says, "I miss Katya. It's hard being the only woman on the Council."`
	"CN-2946" `	"Don't worry, the Navy said they're trying to find her and return her to us."`
	"CN-2947" `	"Do you think the Navy reneged on their promise to free her?"`
	"CN-2948" `	"I don't know," she says. "I hope the Navy will keep their promise. But in the meantime, three people on Council is too few. We didn't want to say anything to you until the Senate cleared it, but we've nominated you to take Tomek's spot on the Council. What do you say?"`
	"CN-2949" `	"I'd be honored. Thank you."`
	"CN-2950" `	She grins. "Don't mention it. You've been with us since the beginning, and we've all come to trust what you have to say. I wish we could throw you a big dinner or something to celebrate, but... well, we're all busy with the war right now. But Alondo and JJ both said to tell you they're glad to have you on board. And you'll get a salary increase, of course. Which you ought to celebrate by buying us both a few drinks in the spaceport bar before you leave. Okay?"`
	"CN-2951" `	"Okay, I'll meet you back at the spaceport in a few hours."`
	"CN-2952" `	"Great," she says, smiling. "See you then." She picks up her suitcase, and hurries over to the shipyard.`
	"CN-2953" `Freya turns out to be a whiskey drinker. By the time she has finished her first drink, she is chattering quite passionately about starship design: load balancing, stress lines, shield matrices, shipboard computers. Rather than dulling her intelligence, alcohol just seems to reduce her ability to explain things in ways a non-specialist can understand. You try to steer the conversation towards something less technical...`
	"CN-2954" `	"So, why did you join the Council, initially?"`
	"CN-2955" `	"Where's your home planet?"`
	"CN-2956" `	"How long do you think it will be before they're mass-producing Dreadnoughts?"`
	"CN-2957" `	"Well," she says, "you know the Council. Visionaries, big picture people. They needed someone who could take care of the actual concrete details. Data crunching for our 'thousand eyes' program tracking pirate fleet movements. Supply chain management. This was back in the days of the Pact, of course, before we had officially separated from the Republic. And I had worked with JJ in the past, so he asked me to come with him and help out on a larger scale."`
	"CN-2958" `	"I grew up on Earth," she says, "deep in the bowels of one of the major cities. Even as a kid I hated that dirty old planet and knew my only shot of leaving there was to be smarter than everyone else. It wasn't until years later, when I came back to visit with some money in my pocket and a bit more perspective, that I was able to travel to the few parts of Earth that are still pretty, and realize how precious our home world is."`
	"CN-2959" `	"Ugh," she says, "let's not talk about work while we're busy relaxing." You refrain from commenting that all her talk about starship design sounded a lot more like work than like a fun relaxing topic of conversation.`
	"CN-2960" `	You hang out in the bar for another hour or so, and then she says to the bartender, "Two bottles of champagne to go, please." He gives her an odd look, but the Council is well enough respected that he does not question her.`
	"CN-2961" `	You walk over to the shipyard, where the two newly completed Dreadnoughts are parked side by side. "Time to christen our new ships," she says, handing you one of the bottles. You each fling a bottle at one of the ships, and shout out...`
	"CN-2962" `	"For victory!"`
	"CN-2963" `	"For peace!"`
	"CN-2964" `	"For justice!"`
	"CN-2965" `	"May it come soon," echoes Freya. "Now, tomorrow morning the crews for these ships will be ready, and we'll need you to escort them to <planet>. I'll stay here and do my best to help manage the equipment supply chain and construction crews." She says goodnight, and wishes you a safe journey tomorrow.`
	"CN-2966" `Waiting for you on <origin> is a message from Alondo: "Hello Captain! We've got another minor crisis: a merchant fleet was supposed to bring us a shipment of medical supplies from up North, since many of our worlds are running short. But, the Republic is threatening to attack the convoy if they try to cross over into our space, so they're waiting on <planet>, just inside of the Republic's territory. Please go meet up with the fleet and bring it back to New Tibet."`
	"CN-2967" `You land on <origin> and meet up with the fleet you will be escorting. A few minutes later, an urgent message comes in from Alondo: "We've got a crazy situation here. Return to New Tibet immediately with the convoy. You will find a Navy Oathkeeper ship in orbit. Do not attack them, just see to it that the convoy lands safely." The Oathkeepers are Navy officers who swore not to fight the Free Worlds, so you can't help wondering what they are doing on <planet>.`
	"CN-2968" `You land on <origin> and meet up with the fleet you will be escorting. A few minutes later, an urgent message comes in from Alondo: "We've got a crazy situation here. Return to New Tibet immediately with the convoy." He provides no further information.`
	"CN-2969" `You land the convoy safely on <origin>, but everyone seems to be busy with whatever new crisis it is that Alondo alluded to; no one approaches you to help unload the ships. Eventually you track down Alondo and ask what is going on, and why there is a neutral Navy ship in orbit. "We just received word that Poisonwood has been captured by pirates, while all of our fleets were busy guarding the front," says Alondo. You recall that Poisonwood has remained loyal to the Republic, even though they are deep inside Free Worlds territory.`
	"CN-2970" `	"If we liberate them, will they switch their loyalty to our side?"`
	"CN-2971" `	"If they're not one of our worlds, why should we help them?"`
	"CN-2972" `	"Possibly," says Alondo. "But that's not what is important. Before they were overrun by pirate troops, one of the colonists managed to take a photo of the pirate leader."`
	"CN-2973" `	"Because one of the colonists took a picture of the leader of the pirates who attacked them," says Alondo.`
	"CN-2974" `	He hands you a small printout of a photograph. It is a somewhat blurry picture of a group of armed pirates running down a street in a desert town. What grabs your attention immediately is that several of the pirates appear to have green skin. You recognize that as the mark of the Alphas, the sociopathic, genetically engineered super-humans who enslaved entire planets during the Alpha Wars, five centuries ago.`
	"CN-2975" `	"It must be a trick. There can't still be Alphas around. Maybe the pirates dyed their skin green to make people fear them."`
	"CN-2976" `	"How is it possible that some of the Alphas are still alive?"`
	"CN-2977" `	Alondo says, "This may be a trick, but we can't afford to take that risk. The Alphas were the greatest threat humanity has ever faced. And before they contacted us for help, Poisonwood reached out to the Navy." As he is speaking, a shadow passes overhead. You look up and see the unmistakable silhouette of a Navy Cruiser, coming in for a landing.`
	"CN-2978" `	"Are you insane? You're letting the Navy come here?"`
	"CN-2979" `	"We're going to work side by side with the Navy right after that awful battle?"`
	"CN-2980" `	Alondo explains, "It's only one Cruiser, an 'Oathkeeper' ship, sworn to take no part in our war. The Free Worlds have almost no troops trained for ground combat, so without the Navy's help we would be unlikely to be able to eliminate the Alphas."`
	"CN-2981" `	The Navy ship lands, and a man steps off who you recognize immediately: Admiral William Danforth, who is something of a folk hero throughout human space, and who you have heard is the commander of the entire Oathkeeper regiment. With him is a man who he introduces as Commander Aaron Nguyen of the Navy Humanitarian Corps. As Nguyen shakes your hand, you are struck by the fact that although he is your enemy, you see no trace of hostility in his eyes - in fact, his expression is surprisingly warm and affectionate.`
	"CN-2982" `	"We have no room for error," says Danforth. "These Alphas must be eliminated, and they must not be allowed to escape. On that, at least, we can all agree."`
	"CN-2983" `	Alondo says, "Captain <last> will lead the attack." He beckons to two of the Free Worlds captains. "Marco, Emily, you will join them with your Falcons. Destroy any pirate ships in orbit, then land and secure the facility. Understood?" You nod, and prepare to take off for the <system> system.`
	"CN-2984" `The ships in orbit are eliminated, but there are still the Alphas and their servants here on the ground to take care of. Danforth's ship unloads a squadron of troops in heavy battle suits. The Navy troops move with far more precision and purpose than you have ever seen among the poorly trained Free Worlds soldiers.`
	"CN-2985" `	They sweep the city and quickly ascertain that the Alphas are holed up in a large factory. The troops encircle the building and burst through the doors, and soon you hear the sounds of explosions and gunfire within. You wait with Commander Nguyen in an alley facing the building. "I'm with the Humanitarian Corps," he explains. "Killing things is not in my job description."`
	"CN-2986" `	Just then, one of the second floor windows shatters and a figure comes tumbling out, rolls, and starts running in your direction. Then it does something you would swear no human being is capable of: while still moving in your direction, it begins leaping from one wall of the alley to the other as easily as you would run up a staircase, gaining altitude with each jump so that soon it will pass two or three meters above your heads. Several Navy troops are running after it, but they hold their fire to avoid hitting you and Nguyen.`
	"CN-2987" `	(Try to shoot it.)`
	"CN-2988" `	(Try to grab it.)`
	"CN-2989" `	You open fire, but it is leaping back and forth so fast that it is almost impossible to hit. But then you see Commander Nguyen climb onto a nearby dumpster and leap into the air, managing to grab the creature by the leg as it flies by.`
	"CN-2990" `	Unfortunately, by now the creature is far outside your reach. But then you see Commander Nguyen climb onto a nearby dumpster and leap into the air, managing to grab the creature by the leg as it flies by.`
	"CN-2991" `	The two of them fall to the ground and roll over and over in a jumble of limbs. You and the Navy troops run after them, afraid to shoot for fear of hitting Nguyen. But somehow Nguyen gets the upper hand, pinning the creature in a full nelson hold, with his legs wrapped around its body to keep it from kicking him. "Kill it!" he shouts.`
	"CN-2992" `	(Kill it.)`
	"CN-2993" `	(Let the Navy troops deal with this.)`
	"CN-2994" `	While Nguyen holds the creature still, you put a gun to its head and pull the trigger. Not even an Alpha can survive that; the creature goes limp. Now that you can get a good look at it, you can see that it does indeed have green skin.`
	"CN-2995" `	While Nguyen holds the creature still, one of the Navy troops puts a gun to its head and pulls the trigger. Not even an Alpha can survive that; the creature goes limp. Now that you can get a good look at it, you can see that it does indeed have green skin.`
	"CN-2996" `	Nguyen gets shakily to his feet; he looks stunned and very pale. "Thank you," he says. The sounds of gunfire within the factory eventually die down. "We'll continue to patrol the city," says Nguyen, "in case there are more of them. Then I'll meet you in the spaceport." He heads off back into the city.`
	"CN-2997" `You land the convoy safely on <origin>, but everyone seems to be busy with whatever new crisis it is that Alondo alluded to; no one approaches you to help unload the ships. Eventually you track down Alondo and ask what is going on. "We just received word that Poisonwood has been captured by pirates, while all of our fleets were busy elsewhere," says Alondo. You recall that Poisonwood has remained loyal to the Republic, even though they are deep inside Free Worlds territory.`
	"CN-2998" `	Alondo says, "This may be a trick, but we can't afford to take that risk. The Alphas were the greatest threat humanity has ever faced. We have very few people trained in ground combat, but I've gathered some of our best and loaded them onto a fleet that will be accompanying you. Destroy any pirate ships in orbit, then land and secure the facility. Understood? And don't let any of your escorts die; they're carrying the troops you'll need for the ground battle." You nod, and prepare to take off for the <system> system.`
	"CN-2999" `When you meet up with Nguyen, he still looks very worried. "We think we killed them all," he says, "but we can't be sure. Also, we recovered some instruments for genetic manipulation from the factory. The Alphas can't breed normally, because if their offspring inherit some of the Alpha mutations but not others, the result is rarely viable, and even those that live long enough to be born don't have all the Alpha traits. So, they rely on artificial insemination instead."`
	"CN-3000" `	"Well, it's good news that you recovered those instruments, then."`
	"CN-3001" `	"It would be," says Nguyen, "except that we also discovered that several dozen of the women who were taken as slaves... are now pregnant. We'll have to ask them to terminate their pregnancies. It's the only safe decision, but I still don't like it." He sighs. "I'm a Buddhist, you know. Committed to doing harm to no living thing. That's why I joined the Humanitarian Corps. They promised me I'd never be asked to take a life."`
	"CN-3002" `	"Is that why you didn't kill that Alpha yourself, on the street?"`
	"CN-3003" `	"That doesn't seem like a moral dilemma to me. We know those children will grow up to be monsters."`
	"CN-3004" `	"Couldn't we let the children be born, if that's what the women want, then imprison them or something if they do turn out to be Alphas?"`
	"CN-3005" `	"Yes," he says. "Silly, isn't it? Anyway, this is my job to deal with; you need to go find Danforth."`
	"CN-3006" `	"Well," he says, "I envy you for living in a universe where decisions like this are easy. But to me it's still a painful choice to make. Anyway, that's my problem to deal with, not yours; you need to go find Danforth."`
	"CN-3007" `	"The Alphas were originally bred to be super-soldiers," he says, "a weapon in the hands of a despotic government. As much as I hate to admit it, there are certain branches of the Republic who would love to get their hands on a small army of impressionable Alpha children. Far better for them to die than for that to happen. Anyway, that's my job to deal with; you need to go find Danforth."`
	"CN-3008" `	He leaves, and you return to Danforth's ship. Danforth says, "Hello there, temporary ally. It was an honor to fight alongside you, while it lasted."`
	"CN-3009" `	"You too. I wish we could bring this war to an end."`
	"CN-3010" `	"If the Republic would just leave us alone, we wouldn't need to be enemies."`
	"CN-3011" `	"I know," he says. "But for now, I need to return to my fleet. Which means I'll be needing an escort out of your territory, just to make sure no one attacks me. Maybe you could take us by way of New Tibet? I'm sure Commander Nguyen would appreciate one last visit to the Buddhist monasteries there before that world becomes closed off to us completely." You agree, and he begins preparing his ship for takeoff.`
	"CN-3012" `Soon after landing on <origin>, you receive an encoded message from Admiral Danforth, the leader of the Oathkeepers. "Captain <last>," he says, "I would like to thank you once again for allowing us to assist you on Poisonwood. Unfortunately, I have bad news that may concern you. Commander Nguyen, who was with you when one of the Alphas was apprehended, has been assassinated, shot in the head at point blank range. His attacker has not been found. We fear that this may be retribution for his part in the action on Poisonwood, and we urge you and your crew to be cautious. With deepest regards - Danforth."`
	"CN-3013" `The ships in orbit are eliminated, but there are still the Alphas and their servants here on the ground to take care of. Your escorts unload the troops, who spread throughout the city and quickly determine that, as far as the locals know, the Alphas are all holed up in a large factory on the outskirts of town. The locals also inform you that the Alphas have taken dozens of prisoners and are holding them in the factory.`
	"CN-3014" `	As you are trying to prepare the Free Worlds troops to storm the building, suddenly one of your escorts, the Starry Warrior, takes off. You radio the captain, who responds, "Sorry, Captain, but I'm following orders. Alondo suspected you wouldn't like this." Then he opens fire on the factory, destroying everything within several blocks with blaster fire and torpedoes. He does not stop firing until there is nothing left but smoldering rubble in that entire section of the city.`
	"CN-3015" `	The Alphas are presumably dead. So are their prisoners, and any of the locals who were unlucky enough to be close to the factory when it was destroyed. The governor of Poisonwood, unable to conceal her anger, asks you to take your troops and your ships and leave her world immediately.`
	"CN-3016" `	You send a message to the Council asking what you should do, and they tell you to leave the planet and join Alondo on <planet>, to help bolster the defenses there. You leave <origin> with a heavy heart, glad that the Alphas are gone but wishing things here on <origin> had ended differently.`
	"CN-3017" `You report in to Alondo, who listens to your description of the battle for Poisonwood with a grim expression on his face. "It's not the end, of course," he says. "It seems like no matter how many times we win a battle against the Alphas, there are more of them out there. But I'm glad that the immediate crisis has been dealt with."`
	"CN-3018" `	"Isn't there any way we can track down the rest of the Alphas?"`
	"CN-3019" `	"What is our next mission now?"`
	"CN-3020" `	"Not really," he says. "There are probably small enclaves throughout human space, and perhaps beyond our space as well. All we can do is make it harder for them to grow powerful."`
	"CN-3021" `	"And how do we do that?" you ask.`
	"CN-3022" `	"The Senate has authorized a diplomatic mission to Bloodsea," he says. "It's the smallest of the pirate worlds, and we're going to see what we need to offer them to get them to join the Free Worlds. The official settlements there only amount to a few thousand people, so it shouldn't be too hard to convince them that joining us is better than resisting us."`
	"CN-3023" `	"Okay, sounds like fun!"`
	"CN-3024" `	"Wait, didn't things go south rather quickly the last time we attempted this?"`
	"CN-3025" `	Alondo grins. "Yes, but the Free Worlds are in a much stronger position now, and the pirate worlds know it's only a matter of time before they are forced to become civilized. And, the incident on Poisonwood proved that we can't afford to fight a war on two fronts. We need to eliminate the pirate threat, and a diplomatic solution with them is the only sort that will last. So, let's get going!"`
	"CN-3026" `The local leaders are unwilling to meet aboard your ship, and Alondo is afraid you will be ambushed if you venture too far away from it, so eventually they agree to set up a tent on the landing pad next to yours and meet there. Outside, a storm is raging, the rain mixing with salt spray from the blood-red ocean nearby.`
	"CN-3027" `	Most of the leaders grimace at the sight of you. "What is the invader doing here?" one of them asks to Alondo.`
	"CN-3028" `	"Captain <last> was only following orders, but the officer responsible for giving those orders has been justly punished," Alondo says. "We come in peace this time." The leaders don't seem convinced with that answer, but they agree to continue.`
	"CN-3029" `	As you talk, it becomes clear that the inhabitants of Bloodsea are ashamed of how destitute and undeveloped their world is. Several of them have visited the island spaceport on Deep, and after dancing around the issue for a while, they make a request: if the Free Worlds builds them a real, modern island spaceport, they will join the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-3030" `	One of them lays out a detailed list of amenities the port must have: concrete seawalls, raised landing pads, floating docks, sturdy hangars and warehouses, and various defense systems "for when the others learn that we've decided to join you." Also, the deal is off if you show up in orbit with a fleet that "looks like an invasion fleet rather than a construction fleet."`
	"CN-3031" `	You thank them and return to your ship. Alondo asks, "What do you think?"`
	"CN-3032" `	"Well, building a spaceport is probably cheaper than fighting a major battle."`
	"CN-3033" `	"They're asking a lot. Why don't we just invade them?"`
	"CN-3034" `	"Yes," he says, "except that I can almost guarantee that when we show up on their doorstep with everything they asked for, some local warlord will attack our ships, steal our supplies, enslave our workers, and build himself a nice cozy island fortress."`
	"CN-3035" `	"So, we attack them?" you ask.`
	"CN-3036" `	"They didn't seem very happy about you doing that the first time. But..." Alondo pauses for a moment.`
	"CN-3037" `	"That's certainly the simpler option," he says. "Tomek may have been punished for disobeying the Senate's orders, but we're in a different situation now. Our numbers have swelled because of our victories and new territory, and we now have the Dreadnoughts at our disposal, so occupying Bloodsea is now a viable option.`
	"CN-3038" `	"You're on the Council now," he says. "I'll leave it up to you. Option one is, we bring them the supplies and workers, in merchant ships, but use very heavily armed merchant ships in case they double cross us. Option two is, we go to Dancer and see if JJ can lend us an invasion fleet while I convince the Senate that attacking Bloodsea is the better decision."`
	"CN-3039" `Waiting for you in the spaceport on <origin> are two Behemoth heavy freighters, which will be carrying the equipment and workers to Bloodsea. You can't help notice that nearly a third of their cargo space has been converted into extra outfit space, and both ships have a pair of Plasma Turrets mounted on them, and what looks like Torpedo Launchers as well.`
	"CN-3040" `	While you are on Zug, you and Alondo meet up with Freya and ask how the Dreadnought production is going. "We're nearly there," she says, "just one or two kinks left to work out. They've produced another two prototypes, but not enough to start selling them yet. I know, you're itching to pilot one of your own. Believe me, we're working as fast as possible."`
	"CN-3041" `	Your next stop is to pick up more workers and construction supplies on <destination>.`
	"CN-3042" `You stop on <origin>, and wait as more supplies are loaded onto the two Behemoths you are escorting. Your final stop is <planet>. Alondo thought it likely that some pirates would try to intercept your convoy and steal its cargo, but as long as both freighters land on the planet without being captured or destroyed, you will be able to begin the construction project and thus meet the demands of the people on <planet> to convince them to join the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-3043" `A few of the locals on Bloodsea appear surprised that you actually brought the supplies for a new spaceport, and that you arrived with all the supplies intact. But after meeting up with Alondo, they agree to hold their side of the bargain: from now on, Bloodsea will be a part of the Free Worlds, with all the rights and responsibilities that implies. And that means that they will refuse to knowingly harbor any pirate fleets or other known criminals.`
	"CN-3044" `	Alondo tells you that he will catch a ride back with the freighters when they return. "But, you'll probably want to head out sooner," he says, "because I've got some good news for you. Freya just contacted me, to say that they're now ready to start selling Dreadnoughts to certain select members of the Free Worlds, including you. That also means she's done with her work on Zug, so she'll need you to give her a lift from there."`
	"CN-3045" `Ijs approaches you with his duffel as you're stepping off the <ship>.`
	"CN-3046" `	"Thanks for getting me this close, but I really need to get to Winter as soon as possible. I hope you don't take offense that I've booked passage on another transport. Here's <payment> for getting me this far, anyway. I hope to see you again soon, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-3047" `When you meet up with JJ, Alondo explains that you're in need of an invasion fleet for Bloodsea. JJ looks confused at the request. "What? Whatever happened to diplomacy? I only heard that the Senate approved a diplomatic mission. Didn't Tomek get punished for this exact stunt?"`
	"CN-3048" `	"Alondo convinced me that the Bloodsea natives were just planning to betray us."`
	"CN-3049" `	"I don't think the pirates will understand any language except overwhelming force."`
	"CN-3050" `	"You're starting to sound a lot like Tomek," JJ remarks.`
	"CN-3051" `	"I also contacted the Senate on the way here," Alondo says, "and they approved the invasion. We're much more powerful now than before, making invasion a viable option."`
	"CN-3052" `	"Perhaps," says JJ. "I'll provide you with some ships, but I'm not happy about this. I need to keep most of my fleet here, to defend against the Navy, but I'll select a few of the strongest ships to accompany you to Bloodsea. Make sure they make it home safe, though. We'll need every ship we can get for when the Navy attacks. Good luck, Captain."`
	"CN-3053" `You land at the main spaceport on Bloodsea with Free Worlds ships circling overhead, ready to bombard the locals if they show any sign of resistance. It is a tense atmosphere, and the leaders sullenly agree to give the Free Worlds access to their planet and to avoid knowingly supporting piracy or other criminal activity. You have won this world, but you have clearly not won the hearts of the locals.`
	"CN-3054" `	A while later, you receive new orders from Alondo. "I've got some good news for you," he says. "Freya just contacted me, to say that they're now ready to start selling Dreadnoughts to certain select members of the Free Worlds, including you. That also means she's done with her work on Zug, so she'll need you to give her a lift from there."`
	"CN-3055" `Freya comes to your ship soon after you land. She is beaming, and looks more relaxed than you have seen her in months. "Southbound Shipyards is churning out Dreadnoughts now!" she says. "Still only at a rate of one a week or so, but for a ship this big that's quite impressive. And it means you can now buy one of your own, if you've got enough savings. Seriously, even if you can't afford one yet, be sure to stop by the shipyard and check them out." She is clearly very proud.`
	"CN-3056" `	"Great job, Freya! I'm really glad to have a talented engineer on the Council to help get things done."`
	"CN-3057" `	"Glad to hear it. Now, what is our next action against the pirates?"`
	"CN-3058" `	She smiles. "Thanks. It was actually really refreshing to be able to tackle a concrete, solvable problem for a change, instead of all this nebulous political stuff. Speaking of which, our next step will be to go visit JJ. He's going to be doing the diplomatic outreach to Albatross."`
	"CN-3059" `	"Right, right, back to work," she says. "Well, it sounds like the next order of business is for you to transport me to <planet> to take JJ's place there while he makes a diplomatic visit to Albatross."`
	"CN-3060" `	You ask, "Wait, doesn't Alondo usually handle the diplomacy?"`
	"CN-3061" `	"Usually, yes," she says. "But the locals on Albatross specifically asked for JJ. They're a very traditional population, and JJ is well-known as both a family man and a brave soldier. Whereas Alondo is... Alondo."`
	"CN-3062" `	"Fair enough. Let's head to <planet>!"`
	"CN-3063" `	"Wait, I don't understand. Why don't they like Alondo?"`
	"CN-3064" `	She looks genuinely surprised that you don't know. "Alondo is gay," she says. "There are few worlds here in the South where that would bother anyone, but Albatross is one of them. So Alondo is taking a break to go visit the Senate, while JJ deals with this particular diplomatic situation."`
	"CN-3065" `	"Okay, I feel silly for even asking. Let's go meet up with JJ!"`
	"CN-3066" `	"Actually, I'm gay too."`
	"CN-3067" `	"Ah. That certainly explains some things."`
	"CN-3068" `	"It seems crazy that anyone would be bothered by that in this day and age."`
	"CN-3069" `	"Yes," she says. "Yes, it does. Now, let's go meet up with JJ."`
	"CN-3070" `	Freya raises an eyebrow. "I hadn't heard. We don't have time to find someone else for this mission, so you'll need to be the one to transport JJ. Stay safe."`
	"CN-3071" `When you meet up with JJ, he looks exhausted. "Our scouts are reporting that the Navy is building a massive base on New Iceland," he says, "just a few jumps away from here. So every day I look up at the sky and wonder if today is the day when they will invade."`
	"CN-3072" `	You talk for a while and agree that despite the threat from the Navy, dealing with the pirates is important. JJ explains that Albatross started out as a sort of farming commune: independent, but not associated with any illegal activity. But they were dominated by pirates, and since then, one pirate overlord after another has held sway over the planet. So in principle at least, the locals ought to welcome the idea of Free Worlds protection.`
	"CN-3073" `	While you are traveling with JJ, Freya agrees to stay here and work on a better surveillance network, to give Dancer advance warning if the Navy decides to invade.`
	"CN-3074" `JJ puts a hand on your shoulder before leaving the ship. "Freya let me know. For safety reasons only, of course. You can stay here if you aren't comfortable."`
	"CN-3075" `	"No, I'll come with you."`
	"CN-3076" `	"Thank you. I'll stay."`
	"CN-3077" `Your meeting with the elders of Albatross happens in secret, by night. They are afraid that if their current pirate overlord, Ryk Bartlett, finds out that they have met with you, they will face retribution. JJ begins by describing the Free Worlds' offer: all the benefits of the mutual defense pact, in exchange for an agreement to uphold human rights and the rule of law, plus offering financial support for the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-3078" `	"Begging your pardon," says one of the elders, "but what makes you different from any pirate organization that comes in here, demanding our money in return for 'protection'?"`
	"CN-3079" `	(Let JJ answer that.)`
	"CN-3080" `	(Try to give an explanation myself.)`
	"CN-3081" `	"We're a representative government," you say, "with open financial records and clear human rights guidelines that we uphold."`
	"CN-3082" `	JJ explains about the Senate, that each world has a say in how the Free Worlds income is spent. "And," he says, "we will not take your children as slaves, or force you to work in factories producing illegal drugs."`
	"CN-3083" `	The elder who spoke seems unconvinced. "Seems to me that you 'Council' folks are the real rulers, and your 'Senate' is a figurehead," he says. "So I don't call that true democracy."`
	"CN-3084" `	"Maybe," says another of the elders, "but they're still better than Bartlett. I say, if the Free Worlds can free us from him, we'll at least give their new government a try." A few of the others nod in agreement.`
	"CN-3085" `	They explain that to the best of their knowledge, Bartlett is spending most of his time near the Zeta Aquilae system, plundering merchant convoys of heavy metals coming out of Rand and Oblivion. If you can destroy Bartlett and his flagship, the Dread, his followers will probably disperse.`
	"CN-3086" `	The meeting with the elders of Albatross happens in secret, by night. They are afraid that if their current pirate overlord, Ryk Bartlett, finds out that they have met with you, they will face retribution. You wait in your ship while JJ attempts to convince the elders that they should join the Free Worlds. After some hours, JJ returns.`
	"CN-3087" `	"They're interested," JJ says to you, "but they want the current warlord dead."`
	"CN-3088" `	They explained that to the best of their knowledge, Bartlett is spending most of his time near the Zeta Aquilae system, plundering merchant convoys of heavy metals coming out of Rand and Oblivion. If you can destroy Bartlett and his flagship, the Dread, his followers will probably disperse.`
	"CN-3089" `When the elders on Albatross learn that you have destroyed Ryk Bartlett and freed them from his rule, they grudgingly agree to join the Free Worlds, "at least on a trial basis." You hope that you will be able to live up to the promises you have given them.`
	"CN-3090" `	After you return to your ship, JJ says, "So far Freya says there have been no hints of a Navy attack against Dancer, and she has a new set of surveillance satellites up and running in Alpha Arae to monitor fleet activity. So, let's go meet up with her and decide what our next steps should be."`
	"CN-3091" `When you land on Dancer, Freya has just received some exciting news. "It turns out taking out Bartlett had some unexpected side effects," she says. "Bartlett has been hounding the systems on the northeastern fringe of the Dirt Belt for years, and had a lot of enemies. The governments of Rand and Oblivion are so grateful to you for eliminating him that they've reached out to us to begin the process of joining the Free Worlds! And several other worlds in that region are interested now, too."`
	"CN-3092" `	JJ frowns. "That's really awful timing," he says, "and would put us in a really bad tactical position - spread out, and with the Navy right in the middle."`
	"CN-3093" `	"Are you saying we shouldn't let them join, even though they want to?"`
	"CN-3094" `	"Well, I say, if they want to join us, we should let them. Who knows if they'll be this enthusiastic about the Free Worlds later if we let them down now."`
	"CN-3095" `	JJ thinks about that for a moment, then says, "Well, I guess we should let them join. It will mean we may need to launch an assault to drive the Navy off New Iceland. But if we do that, our tactical position shifts from one that's worse than what we have now, to something much better. Freya, did they say if there's any sign that the Navy has gotten word of this?"`
	"CN-3096" `	"A few Carriers are in orbit around Rand," she says, "so they must suspect something. But the bulk of the Navy fleet is still to the north and east of here."`
	"CN-3097" `	JJ says, "Okay Captain, here's what I propose. We'll leave the bulk of our fleet here to defend Dancer and New Portland, but take a few of our best ships to Zeta Aquilae and drive out the Navy. Freya and I will travel with you so that if we need to make any decisions, we'll have most of the Council there in person. How does that sound?"`
	"CN-3098" `	"It sounds like a good plan. Let's do it!"`
	"CN-3099" `	"I'm still worried we're over-extending ourselves."`
	"CN-3100" `	"You may be right," he says. "Freya, what do you think?"`
	"CN-3101" `	"I think we need to take this opportunity while it's available," she says. "Sorry, Captain, but I'm with JJ on this one." They both board your ship, and you get ready to travel to Zeta Aquilae.`
	"CN-3102" `You meet up with the governor of Rand, and sign the papers to make her planet a part of the Free Worlds. The nearby systems are reporting no Navy interference: they seem to have been allowed to switch allegiances without any attempt by the Republic to stop them. Of course, that might partly be because these are mining planets, not as necessary to the Republic's survival as the farming worlds on the other end of the Dirt Belt.`
	"CN-3103" `	Freya leaves the meeting to check up on her surveillance network, and rushes back into the room a few minutes later. JJ takes one look at the expression on her face and quickly excuses himself from the table. You join him outside in the hallway, and he asks Freya what's going on.`
	"CN-3104" `	"The Navy just invaded Delta Sagittarii and Rastaban," she says. "We're cut off from the rest of Free space. Our defense fleet was woefully outnumbered. Many ships were destroyed, and the rest fled back toward the Rim, or to Tarazed."`
	"CN-3105" `	"I was afraid of this," says JJ, "but I didn't think it would happen so quickly. I wonder if they knew that these new worlds were joining us, and deliberately used them as a diversion."`
	"CN-3106" `	"What do we do now?"`
	"CN-3107" `	JJ says, "Freya, you said part of our fleet fled to Tarazed?"`
	"CN-3108" `	"Yes," she says. "Probably not a strong enough fleet to drive them off, though."`
	"CN-3109" `	"Well, I guess we should regroup with them," he says. "Hopefully then we can plan a coordinated strike. Or if necessary, we can abandon this sector and get our fleet back to the Rim without losing too many ships. Captain <last>, can you take us to <destination>?"`
	"CN-3110" `	"What if the Navy follows the fleet to Wayfarer? We're three of the four Council members. Shouldn't we avoid a situation where we could all be killed?"`
	"CN-3111" `	From JJ's expression, it's clear that he doesn't even want to dignify that question with a response. "If we die, the Free Worlds will live on," he says, "and there's no way we're abandoning a whole section of the fleet just to save our own skins. So, let's go to Wayfarer."`
	"CN-3112" `The fleet in orbit around Wayfarer is pitifully small, surely not enough to take on more than a couple of Navy capital ships. JJ orders one of their communication officers to try to establish a secure link to Bourne or to any Free Worlds post on the other side of the Navy blockade. After about ten minutes, the officer returns and says, "Sir, we've received communications from New Tibet sent earlier today. You need to talk to them."`
	"CN-3113" `	"Our fleet is there?" asks JJ.`
	"CN-3114" `	"No sir, it's the Syndicate. The Syndicate has a war fleet in Alioth."`
	"CN-3115" `	"What?" says JJ. He rushes into the communication room, and you and Freya follow. "Play the communication," JJ says. On the video screen is a Buddhist monk in a maroon robe; behind him, you see other monks rushing about with none of the serenity you would usually expect of them.`
	"CN-3116" `	The monk explains, "I pray that this communication reaches the Council. Yesterday a Syndicate ship landed near our monastery, and the pilot sought refuge with us. He claims to have evidence that the Syndicate, or some faction within the Syndicate, was behind the attacks on Geminus and Martini. Evidence that a certain faction within the Syndicate values economic growth above all else," says the monk, "and incited this war for that reason."`
	"CN-3117" `	"That's insane," says Freya.`
	"CN-3118" `	"But not completely implausible," says JJ.`
	"CN-3119" `	(Continue watching the communication.)`
	"CN-3120" `	The video of the monk continues, "He was unable to show us this evidence, but he made claims of having plans for a nuclear device. After arriving he hid his ship in a cave, just before a Syndicate fleet appeared in orbit. They do not know where the defector landed, so they have begun searching settlement to settlement under the assumption that one is harboring him. They are currently here, wrecking the monastery in their hunt."`
	"CN-3121" `	After a moment, JJ says, "If these allegations are true, if we can prove that the Free Worlds were innocent of any involvement in those attacks, the Republic might make peace with us, or at least agree to a ceasefire. I vote that we try to shelter this defector and hear his story."`
	"CN-3122" `	"And if it's a lie," says Freya, "and we refuse the Syndicate's request, we lose our only ally. Many more civilians will be killed if we continue to fight without their backing, and we don't even know what this supposed evidence actually is. I care about justice, but trading a definite ally for a slim possibility of peace: that is an unwise investment. I vote that we hand this man over to the Syndicate."`
	"CN-3123" `	You look back at the video screen to see that the monk is gone, replaced by a man in a Syndicated Security uniform. "Greetings, Councilmembers. I'm sorry for the confusion, but please understand. We're hunting a terrorist. This man claiming that we are the ones that caused the bombings is, in fact, the leader of the extremist group that caused them. He developed the nukes with the help of a faction of pirates looking to profit from the instability, and now, when we're finally close to capturing him, he's attempting to frame us for his own crimes against humanity. Allow us to find him, and we'll-"`
	"CN-3124" `	The feed cuts off. "The message ended there," the communications officer says. The room falls silent.`
	"CN-3125" `	JJ breaks the silence. "I still say we rescue this defector. The Syndicate could be lying to us. They don't exactly have a reputation for upstanding morality, after all."`
	"CN-3126" `	"Or this 'defector' could easily be the one lying," Freya says. "I say we let them have him while we focus on defending against the Navy. If the Syndicate gets their hands on the true terrorist, their support will surely clear our name. Parliament won't be able to ignore the Syndicate vindicating us."`
	"CN-3127" `	As the third Council member present, you have the deciding vote, and the entire course of this war may rest on your decision.`
	"CN-3128" `	"I say we rescue the defector, even if it means war with the Syndicate."`
	"CN-3129" `	"I say we let the Syndicate have the terrorist, and focus on winning the battle against the Republic."`
	"CN-3130" `	"Are you sure?" asks Freya. "The Syndicate has done a lot for us in the past."`
	"CN-3131" `	"Yes, I'm sure. We rescue the defector."`
	"CN-3132" `	"Fine, we'll hand him over. But I don't think it's the right thing to do."`
	"CN-3133" `	"If Katya were here," says JJ, "she would tell us to choose justice over political expedience."`
	"CN-3134" `	"Well, she's not here, and I say we can't afford to lose the Syndicate as an ally."`
	"CN-3135" `	"I suppose you're right. Let's mount a rescue operation."`
	"CN-3136" `	"Very well," says JJ. "In that case, we'll need to meet with the fleet captains and figure out how to take on the Navy. Let's meet in the spaceport bar in an hour."`
	"CN-3137" `	JJ seems very relieved at your choice. "I think that's the right choice, Captain," he says. "We can take the fleet we have here, sweep up north to avoid the thickest part of the Navy's occupying fleet, and cut over to New Tibet to question the Syndicate in person."`
	"CN-3138" `It doesn't take long to find the monastery that contacted you earlier; nothing is left of it but the burnt-out shells of buildings. You hurry to land and look around for survivors. You find several corpses dressed in maroon robes, some of them badly burnt, but no sign of the defector or the monk who sent the message.`
	"CN-3139" `	(Wait to see if anyone approaches now that the Syndicate fleet is gone.)`
	"CN-3140" `	(Give up and contact the rest of the Free Worlds fleet to figure out what to do next.)`
	"CN-3141" `	You wait around for a while, but this mountain valley seems to be entirely desolate. Then finally, when you are about to give up hope, Freya spots the distant figures of a few dozen people coming down the side of one of the mountains.`
	"CN-3142" `	You are just about to leave when Freya spots something and points. "Look," she says, "someone is coming down the mountain slope toward us." Sure enough, it's a group of several dozen people wearing the distinctive robes of the monks.`
	"CN-3143" `	As you wait for them to approach, JJ receives a message from one of the militia crews. "Sir, you have incoming! A scout ship, with Republic markings. Apparently unarmed. Shall we intercept them?"`
	"CN-3144" `	"Oathkeepers?" asks JJ. "Or ordinary Navy? Who are they?"`
	"CN-3145" `	The voice on the other end pauses. "Neither. Navy Intelligence."`
	"CN-3146" `	JJ thinks about that for a second, then says, "Let them land. But follow them down, and if you see so much as a hint of them powering up weapons, blow them out of the sky. Understand?" The officer acknowledges his order and signs off.`
	"CN-3147" `	As the group of monks approaches from the mountainside, the scout ship comes in for a landing and skids to a halt in the dirt a few dozen meters away. A woman steps off it. She has dark skin, and is dressed entirely in black. Even the whites of her eyes are black: when she gets closer, you can see that it is actually a scleric tattoo, an intricate Celtic knotwork pattern inked into the whites of her eyes. She sees you staring at her, and winks at you with a friendly grin.`
	"CN-3148" `	"I'm Captain <last> of the Free Worlds. What is your business here?"`
	"CN-3149" `	"Who are you, and what gives you the right to land on our planet?"`
	"CN-3150" `	"My name is Raven," she says. "I'm here to question this defector. If he is telling the truth, our war with you will end today." She pauses, then adds, grimly, "And, another war will begin."`
	"CN-3151" `	She frowns. "My name is Raven," she says. "I am here to question this defector. If you are interested in knowing the truth, you will allow me to do so."`
	"CN-3152" `	The monks approach, and you see that among them is a man in more ordinary attire, who must be the defector. "Now," says Raven, "I will question him alone, on my ship."`
	"CN-3153" `	"No, we insist on being present for your interrogation."`
	"CN-3154" `	"Very well, we'll wait outside."`
	"CN-3155" `	"No!" says JJ. "We're staying here."`
	"CN-3156" `	She hesitates for a long moment. This is probably going against whatever orders she is following. But finally she says, "Very well." The monks step aside. She approaches the defector, and reaches out her hands to him. Hesitantly, he takes her hands. It's an oddly intimate scene, the two of them quietly holding hands and locking eyes - not like any interrogation you have seen before. "Now," she says, "tell me your story."`
	"CN-3157" `	"My name is Sawyer," says the man. "I'm a physicist, a Syndicate employee. We had a secret project on Mutiny, a planet in a pirate system. We were developing nuclear weapons." He hesitates, and looks away for a second, then says, "They told me it was for fighting the pirates. I didn't realize otherwise until--"`
	"CN-3158" `	"That is a lie," says Raven, calmly.`
	"CN-3159" `	He seems flustered. "Okay, they didn't tell me what the weapons were for, and I didn't ask."`
	"CN-3160" `	"Why would the Syndicate attack the Republic?"`
	"CN-3161" `	"Why did you wait so long to report this?"`
	"CN-3162" `	They both seem surprised at you asking a question. Sawyer says, "War is good for business, especially if you're in the business of making weapons. The Syndicate's profits have more than doubled since this conflict began."`
	"CN-3163" `	"What led you to report this?" asks Raven.`
	"CN-3164" `	He says, "It was when I heard that there had been another major battle. Up until then I had been telling myself that the worst of the damage was done. But after that battle, I knew that millions more could die because of our crime, and that I had the power to stop it."`
	"CN-3165" `	Raven continues to ask questions: who was involved, how the facility was hidden, where the raw materials came from. At one point, JJ pulls you aside and says, "She must be a Questioner. How they operate is a tightly kept secret. I'd always assumed their methods were... a bit more medieval."`
	"CN-3166" `	Finally, Raven is satisfied, and radios her ship. "He's telling the truth," she tells them. "Send word to the admirals at once. And, release the captive."`
	"CN-3167" `	The door of her ship slides open, and another woman steps out - shakily, hesitantly, shielding her eyes against the sunlight. It takes you a few seconds to realize that it's Katya.`
	"CN-3168" `	As you all rush over to greet Katya, Raven taps your shoulder and says quietly, "Meet me in the main spaceport in a few hours and we'll figure out what's going to happen next." She returns to her ship.`
	"CN-3169" `A few of the Free Worlds crew members are still milling around the spaceport in confusion. You help to gather them together and explain that you are headed out on a very important mission to New Tibet.`
	"CN-3170" `When you and Freya enter the spaceport bar, JJ is talking with someone on his communicator. "The code word is 'havoc,'" he says. "Yes, I'm certain. It's the only option we have left. Good luck."`
	"CN-3171" `	"What was that about?" asks Freya.`
	"CN-3172" `	JJ says, "I was calling in some reinforcements," he says. "A group of ex-militia folks and bounty hunters who want to further the cause of the Free Worlds, but want to do it freelance instead of taking orders from us or the Senate. They call themselves the 'Wolf Pack.' Have you heard of them?"`
	"CN-3173" `	"No, I haven't."`
	"CN-3174" `	"Too bad," says JJ, "they've managed to get their hands on some technology I'd love to have access to. But anyway, they've agreed to make an initial strike and fade attack on the Navy fleet to soften them up, before our own fleet gets there."`
	"CN-3175" `	"Yes, I helped them get access to some better ramscoop technology from the Deep."`
	"CN-3176" `	"No, I haven't had any dealings with them."`
	"CN-3177" `	"That's odd," says JJ, "I thought they said you helped them to get their hands on the Catalytic Ramscoop. But anyway, they've agreed to make an initial strike and fade attack on the Navy fleet to soften them up, before our own fleet gets there."`
	"CN-3178" `	"Ah yes," says JJ, "an excellent piece of corporate espionage. A little shady and underhanded, of course, which is why we let the Wolf Pack handle things like that rather than doing it through official channels. But anyway, they've agreed to make an initial strike and fade attack on the Navy fleet to soften them up, before our own fleet gets there."`
	"CN-3179" `	"That'll need to be one hell of a strike for it to make any difference," says Freya.`
	"CN-3180" `	"Don't worry," says JJ, "it will be. They've been itching to get into the fray for months now. Captain <last>, we'd like you to fly along with the fleet and help to mop up whatever the Wolf Pack leaves behind in the Delta Sagittarii system. Then we'll land on New Portland and figure out what our next steps are. Freya and I will ride on your ship."`
	"CN-3181" `It was a close battle, and could have gone very differently if it were not for the Wolf Pack strike that happened before you arrived and that disabled or destroyed the majority of the Navy fleet. You can't help but wonder how the Wolf Pack managed to assemble a large enough fleet to do that sort of damage.`
	"CN-3182" `	"Well," says JJ, "the die is cast. It's too late now to wonder what that business with the Syndicate was about; now we're in a fight to the finish with the Republic. And that means we must strike soon, before they have time to bring in more reinforcements. Captain <last>, I'd like you to perform a scouting mission while I'm working on gathering a new fleet. Our next target has to be the Navy base on New Iceland. If we can drive them out of that system, our position will be much better. So, I'd like you to fly through Kaus Borealis and return here to report on their fleet strength. Understood?"`
	"CN-3183" `	"No problem."`
	"CN-3184" `	"Sure, but first, can you tell me how the Wolf Pack was able to do so much damage to the Navy?"`
	"CN-3185" `	"As I said," says JJ, "they've gathered a surprising number of bounty hunters and others who operate on the fringes of society, and who are sympathetic to our cause."`
	"CN-3186" `	"One more thing," says Freya, "while you're traveling up North, I wonder if you could help to escort a convoy from the Zeta Aquilae system. There's no huge rush, but they're carrying supplies we need for a new reactor core for the Dreadnoughts, so the sooner you can meet up with them, the sooner the new reactors will be available."`
	"CN-3187" `When you return to New Portland, a sizable Free Worlds fleet is already parked on the landing pads surrounding the spaceport. JJ explains to you, "When the Navy struck and cut our territory in half, a lot of these ships were cut off from their chain of command and just went and sheltered wherever they could. So it took a bit of doing to gather them all together. And now what we need is another stirring victory, or they'll begin to scatter again."`
	"CN-3188" `	"Are you saying we risk having members of our militia desert?"`
	"CN-3189" `	"Well, the fact that they all returned to fight is a good sign."`
	"CN-3190" `	"Yes," says JJ, "some of them already have. Think of it from the perspective of a militia member: you signed up to defend one planet against occasional pirates, not to spend years traveling from system to system battling the Navy. Some people have just had enough. This war needs to end, and end soon."`
	"CN-3191" `	"Well," says JJ, "at least some of them returned to fight. But many of them didn't. Think of it from the perspective of a militia member: you signed up to defend one planet against occasional pirates, not to spend years traveling from system to system battling the Navy. Some people have just had enough. This war needs to end, and end soon."`
	"CN-3192" `	"Well, we can't exactly conquer the Republic. Shouldn't we try diplomacy?"`
	"CN-3193" `	"It sounds to me like we need to make a convincing enough show of strength that Parliament will agree to a ceasefire."`
	"CN-3194" `	"Yes," says JJ, "it will have to be a diplomatic solution in the end. But we must negotiate that solution from a position of strength, not weakness. And that means driving the Navy out of our territory."`
	"CN-3195" `	"Precisely," says JJ, "and the only way to do that is to drive the Navy out of our territory. And if that isn't enough... we have plans for that contingency as well."`
	"CN-3196" `	"So, now we attack Kaus Borealis?" you ask.`
	"CN-3197" `	"That's right," he says. "Once again, the Wolf Pack will go in first and soften them up, then you and your ships will clean up. I've already given the Wolf Pack orders to attack, so please head straight to Kaus Borealis so you can join the fray before they have time to recover."`
	"CN-3198" `As you bring your ship in for a landing, it occurs to you that this is the first time that you have fought a battle for a Republic star system that had not voluntarily decided to join the Free Worlds, and you are not sure what to do next. Fortunately, soon more Free Worlds ships begin arriving, and one of them is carrying Alondo. Tomek is with him. "Hi there, <first>," says Tomek. "Bet you didn't expect to see me again, huh?"`
	"CN-3199" `	Alondo says, "<first>, I'll leave you and Tomek to catch up. I should go talk to the governor immediately. There's no way the locals will have failed to notice the nuclear explosions happening in space right over their heads."`
	"CN-3200" `	"What? We weren't using nukes, just conventional weapons."`
	"CN-3201" `	"Wait, is that what the Wolf Pack was using?"`
	"CN-3202" `	"Yes," says Tomek, "but the Wolf Pack was using nukes." Seeing the incredulous look on your face, he says, "Well, how did you think they were doing all that damage? You thought they had some massive battle fleet hidden somewhere that no one knows about?"`
	"CN-3203" `	"That's right," says Tomek. He doesn't seem terribly happy about it. "How else would they be doing so much damage to the Navy? It's not like they've got a massive battle fleet stashed away somewhere."`
	"CN-3204" `	Alondo hurries off to the city hall to try to meet with the governor, and Tomek explains, "All the Wolf Pack has is a handful of very fast ships armed with nukes. They jump into the system, unload the missiles at whatever targets they can find, and then hightail it out of there before the Navy has a chance to respond. This is quite a mess you all have gotten into while I was gone, by the way."`
	"CN-3205" `	"Weren't you under house arrest?"`
	"CN-3206" `	"So, does the fact that you're here mean the Senate pardoned you?"`
	"CN-3207" `	"Yes," he says. "After that incident with the Alphas on Poisonwood, some folks in the Senate started thinking that I was right to view the pirates as a threat. And when the Navy went on the offensive, they decided I was needed for the war effort. So I've been reinstated. Glad to hear you're on Council now too."`
	"CN-3208" `	"So, what's our next step?"`
	"CN-3209" `	"I'm still really confused about why we're using nukes. Or where we got them from."`
	"CN-3210" `	Tomek frowns. "I'm not too happy about that, myself. The Wolf Pack is buying them from a warlord on Greenrock. And the way they're paying him is with uranium, so every nuke he gives to us means another one or two he can build for himself. Not a good situation, if you ask me, but I guess the Wolf Pack thought it was the only way to turn the tide of the war."`
	"CN-3211" `	"Well," he says, "if we can take Cebalrai, our entire territory will be behind just two choke points, which will allow us to defend ourselves against the Navy without spreading the fleet too thin. So next, I'd like you to go scout out the Cebalrai system and report on the Navy's position there."`
	"CN-3212" `There are a few Navy ships here, but nowhere near as many as were in the Kaus Borealis system before your last attack. Perhaps the Navy has decided to pull back their forces.`
	"CN-3213" `You meet up with Tomek and Alondo and tell them that the defenses in the Cebalrai system did not seem particularly strong. "They must've seen the writing on the wall and pulled back the rest of their fleet," says Alondo.`
	"CN-3214" `	"Either that," says Tomek, "or they're wary of engaging us again now that they know we're willing to use nukes. Which I'm still not happy about, by the way. It's only a matter of time until they respond in kind. But in any case, our next move is clear: bring a fleet to Cebalrai and capture the system. <first>, you'll be in charge of that fleet. Alondo can travel with you to handle the diplomatic aftermath."`
	"CN-3215" `	"Before we go on," Alondo says, "you two should know that I just received word that Tarazed has decided to officially sever ties with us."`
	"CN-3216" `	Tomek looks rather somber before saying, "Bold move for a system we have completely surrounded. They're none of our concern right now. Let's make our way to Cebalrai."`
	"CN-3217" `As you are bringing your ship in for a landing, you hear an odd plinking sound from the hull, similar to the sound of flying through a swarm of micrometeorites. After a few seconds, you realize that it's the sound of your ship being hit by small arms fire from the town below. Your hull is far too strong to be damaged by bullets, but the message is clear: you are not welcome here.`
	"CN-3218" `	The spaceport is apparently deserted, and no one seems eager to come out and greet you. A few bullets continue to plink harmlessly off your hull, from snipers in the nearby buildings. "I think it would be best for me to just contact the governor via radio," says Alondo.`
	"CN-3219" `	"Don't they know our fleet could easily destroy them if we wanted?"`
	"CN-3220" `	"Do you think we have any chance at a peace settlement?"`
	"CN-3221" `	"That would be an awful precedent," says Alondo, "perhaps worse than the fact we're using nukes. If civilian populations become a legitimate target, any of our worlds could be attacked at any time. And it's not like there's any way to defend a world from orbital bombardment. No one would ever be able to feel safe in their own homes again."`
	"CN-3222" `	"I hope so," says Alondo. "We'll let them keep shooting at us for a while, to vent their anger and let them prove their point. Then once they see the Navy isn't going to rescue them, we'll negotiate. That's really our only alternative. I do not want to be the person who authorizes the first attack on civilian targets since the dawn of the Republic."`
	"CN-3223" `	You wait for about an hour. Meanwhile, more Free Worlds ships continue to enter the system, one of which is carrying Tomek. He radios you and says, "I think we've got things under control here, which means there's a new mission for you. You probably aren't going to like this, but we need you to escort a freighter from Oblivion. Part of our ongoing deal with the Devil: a shipment of uranium headed for Greenrock."`
	"CN-3224" `	A Free Worlds ship lands close enough to your own ship that Alondo can transfer over to it without being in sight of the snipers. "Good luck," he says as he departs. "I hope when you return we will have negotiated some sort of meeting with Parliament."`
	"CN-3225" `You land on <origin> and meet up with the grim-faced captain of a Container Transport named the Blue Yonder. "The cargo is already loaded up," he says, "and I'm ready to go. The sooner we get this stuff out of my cargo bays and I can get back to shipping food and medicine, the better. I really hope you folks on Council know what you're doing."`
	"CN-3226" `You land at one of the many private fortresses on Greenrock owned by various competing warlords. Some workers unload the cargo from the Blue Yonder, and load it up with some lead-lined, well-padded crates that must contain nuclear warheads. You're not sure you like being a part of this, but it may be true that this is the only way you will stand a chance against the Navy.`
	"CN-3227" `A member of the Wolf Pack who identifies himself as "Odie" oversees the unloading of the warheads from your ship. "Excellent," he says. "It will take a while to install these in missiles. But once we do, in recognition of how much you have assisted us, Fifi has authorized us to sell them to you if you want."`
	"CN-3228" `	"Great! I think I'd like a dozen of them."`
	"CN-3229" `	"Sorry, I'm following orders by bringing this convoy here, but I want no part in the use of nuclear weapons, even for the sake of winning this war."`
	"CN-3230" `	"Wait, 'Fifi'? Is that your leader?"`
	"CN-3231" `	He laughs. "I'm afraid that's not possible. Unlike most missile systems, we haven't yet developed any sort of feed system that would let you fire multiple missiles from the same gun port. So, it's a weapon you can only fire once from a given port. But on the plus side, two of them are enough to bring down the shields on even the largest Navy vessel."`
	"CN-3232" `	"That's understandable," he says. "And also foolish and shortsighted. But, I can understand why some people want to cling to the belief that war is some sort of noble endeavor rather than a no holds barred struggle for survival."`
	"CN-3233" `	"Yes," he says, "Fifi is the leader of the Wolf Pack. And she is an absolutely ferocious individual. I assure you that you do not want to be responsible for crossing her. Not that you'll ever have to, of course, because we're all on the same side here." He grins.`
	"CN-3234" `	Soon after he is done unloading the cargo, you receive a message from Alondo: "Good news, <first>! The Republic has agreed to allow us to make a diplomatic visit to Parliament. Hurry back here to <planet> before they change their minds."`
	"CN-3235" `When you meet up with Alondo, he seems excited and optimistic. "The Republic has agreed to one week of safe passage," he says, "just enough time to get us to Earth and back. And what's more, I told them that one of our terms would be a mutual release of all prisoners of war, including Katya, and they agreed."`
	"CN-3236" `	"That's great news! Let's get going!"`
	"CN-3237" `	"Wait, isn't this the third time they've promised to give Katya back to us? I'm starting to think she isn't even alive anymore."`
	"CN-3238" `	"Well, I sincerely hope you're wrong," says Alondo. "I miss her. We might never have gotten into such dire straits if she had been leading us."`
	"CN-3239" `	As you are returning to your ship, Alondo points out an Argosy parked next to you and says, "By the way, this ship will be escorting us on this mission. Providing a bit of extra defense."`
	"CN-3240" `	"Um, I don't think an Argosy is strong enough to tip the scales in a battle against the Navy."`
	"CN-3241" `	"Please tell me that thing isn't armed with nukes. Because that would cause a major diplomatic incident."`
	"CN-3242" `	Alondo sighs. "Yes, but the Senate thought if we brought anything bigger, it might look like an attack fleet rather than an escort. And of course, it's not carrying nukes, because if the Navy picked those up on their sensors, they'd blast us out of the sky long before we could land on Earth. Anyway, let's get going and hope for the best."`
	"CN-3243" `	"No, no, of course not," says Alondo. "If the Navy picked those up on their sensors, they'd blast us out of the sky long before we could land on Earth. Anyway, let's get going and hope for the best."`
	"CN-3244" `When you land on Earth, the Big Brother flies down to the spaceport with you to see that you arrive safely, then takes off immediately. You and Alondo are escorted to the House of Parliament. As you wait to be called in to speak to Parliament, Alondo seems very nervous, pacing back and forth and fiddling with his watch every few minutes.`
	"CN-3245" `	Finally you are invited into the Parliament chambers, and Douglas Xao, the Speaker, says, "Representatives of the Free Worlds, we are prepared to hear your demands."`
	"CN-3246" `	Alondo says, "We're not here to make demands. We're here to work together to negotiate a peace settlement. The Free Worlds are prepared to return all our prisoners of war, to cede control of the Cebalrai and Kaus Borealis systems back to the Republic, and to promise not to expand our territory north into the so-called 'breadbasket' worlds, even if those worlds want to join us. All we ask in return is autonomy, and peace, and a return of the prisoners you have taken, including Katya Reynolds."`
	"CN-3247" `	Xao gestures to the guards, and they escort in a third person to stand beside the two of you. It takes you a moment to realize that it's Katya, looking rather worn-out and bedraggled. She whispers to you, "So, you're using nukes now? Whose damn fool idea was that?"`
	"CN-3248" `	"It was the only way we could resist the Navy."`
	"CN-3249" `	"I didn't find out that's what they were doing until afterwards. I don't like it any more than you do."`
	"CN-3250" `	"Fair enough," she says, "but I hope it doesn't wreck our chances at negotiation."`
	"CN-3251" `	Xao addresses the three of you. "We have heard your demands," he says, "and now, here is our response. Katerina Reynolds, Alondo Gruyere, and <first> <last>, you are hereby charged with treason and insurrection. Your trial will begin immediately."`
	"CN-3252" `	"What? We were guaranteed safe passage!"`
	"CN-3253" `	"You will regret this! If you arrest us, the Free Worlds will retaliate against you."`
	"CN-3254" `	As you try to protest, Alondo speaks up. He is not shouting, but his voice carries over the murmur of other voices. "We have a ship in orbit. If we do not return--"`
	"CN-3255" `	Xao cuts him off. "Your ship is no threat to us. We have already verified that it carries no nuclear weapons, and this building's shielding and anti-missile systems are quite sufficient to defend against conventional weapons. And there is nothing in its cargo hold but ordinary, non-radioactive metals."`
	"CN-3256" `	Alondo says, "That's right. Tungsten, to be exact. Aerodynamic tungsten rods, each the size of a tree trunk, with a simple guidance system on one end. Our ship is in low earth orbit, traveling at a velocity of roughly eight kilometers per second." As he speaks, the Parliament chamber gradually grows very quiet. "So we will be returning to our ship," says Alondo, "with Miss Reynolds. If the ship in orbit does not hear from me every two minutes, it will jettison its cargo, and there will be nothing left of this building but a crater." He points to the watch he is wearing, and you realize that it must be some sort of communicator.`
	"CN-3257" `	After a brief whispered consultation with a few of the other members of Parliament, Xao says, "You will lose this war, and you will pay dearly for it. Guards, let them return to their ship." You hurry back to your ship and take off immediately, aware that as soon as you are out of range of Earth, the Navy will probably be more than willing to attack you.`
	"CN-3258" `When you land on Tundra, Tomek seems glad to see Katya back, but you sense that he's also a little wary of how she will respond to the choices the Free Worlds have been making. "Using nukes, threatening orbital bombardment," says Katya, "treating the Syndicate as an ally. Anything else I missed while I was gone?"`
	"CN-3259" `	"We only want this war to be over as soon as possible."`
	"CN-3260" `	"We've just been trying to avoid being destroyed by the Navy, and things have gotten a bit out of hand."`
	"CN-3261" `	"I see," she says. "Did you have a plan for what comes next, or are we just winging it now?"`
	"CN-3262" `	Alondo says, "Unfortunately, we do have a plan. Our very last contingency plan. We call it the 'checkmate' option. Our fleet will push north--"`
	"CN-3263" `	He is interrupted by one of Tomek's men running into the room. "Sir, we have a major Navy fleet incoming. We need all ships in the air immediately to repulse them. Reinforcements are on their way, but they may not get here for a while."`
	"CN-3264" `	Tomek says, "So, it begins. Captain <last>, get back to your ship and aid in the defense."`
	"CN-3265" `Tomek and Alondo meet you when you land. Tomek says, "Good work aiding in the defense. Now we need to move before the Navy has time to regroup. And the Senate has decided that you will be in charge of the fleet that makes our counterattack."`
	"CN-3266" `	Alondo says, "They have also approved a salary increase for you, to seventeen thousand credits per diem. I know that's probably still not enough, but we are running a bit low on cash."`
	"CN-3267" `	"One other thing," says Tomek. "I don't know how you'll feel about this, but I received word from Solace that they have nukes for sale if you want any. I'd advise against it, but it's up to you. Also, since you will be the flagship of our assault, you should make any improvements you feel are necessary to your ship. Then meet us back here, in the spaceport. Of course, if you're ready to go immediately that's fine, too."`
	"CN-3268" `You meet up with Tomek in the spaceport. He is talking with the captain of one of a group of four Clippers that have landed next to each other some distance away from the rest of the Free Worlds fleet. The Clippers appear to have unusually large engines and afterburners, and in place of guns they are each carrying four missiles. Tomek sees you approaching and says, "And here's Captain <last>. Captain, are you ready to lead the attack?"`
	"CN-3269" `	"Yes, I'm ready."`
	"CN-3270" `	"Are these the Wolf Pack ships?"`
	"CN-3271" `	"Yes indeed," says Tomek. "I know, you probably have mixed feelings about this, but they really are the quickest way to win this war."`
	"CN-3272" `	Tomek tells the Wolf Pack captain, "Okay, we're ready to go. Launch immediately, and Captain <last> will follow behind you. <first>, Katya has asked to travel with you; she wants to get back into the action, and I thought she might have the best chance of anyone at dealing with the folks on the ground on <planet>. Once again, you'll need to drive off any Navy ships before landing there. Good luck."`
	"CN-3273" `As soon as you land, you and Katya contact Tomek and inform him that the system is yours. "Excellent," he says. "Press on with your fleet and take Vega before they have time to regroup. Another Wolf Pack fleet will meet you there for the final assault on the Sol system."`
	"CN-3274" `	"Understood. We will depart immediately."`
	"CN-3275" `	"Are we really sure we want to attack Earth?"`
	"CN-3276" `	"Have they given us any other choice?" asks Tomek. "We tried diplomacy. And we cannot hope to defeat the entire Navy. So, unless we wish to surrender and all be put on trial as war criminals, we need to press on and gain the upper hand in the only way we can. The Senate and the Council are agreed on this." You have no choice but to follow his orders and to begin getting your fleet ready for the next attack.`
	"CN-3277" `[Take good care of this fleet, because it will have to last you for the rest of this campaign: if ships are disabled, board them to "repair" them once the battle is over. And, when jumping into battle, remember that you can hold down the jump key to get all your ships ready to jump simultaneously, so no single ship enters the system first and bears the brunt of the enemy fire.]`
	"CN-3278" `The Vega system is eerily deserted. You suspect that the Navy must have pulled back all available ships to defend Earth, rather than trying to fight you here. You try not to think about how massive the fleet there must be, and how slim your chances are of destroying it.`
	"CN-3279" `	Katya says, "Well, this is it, the final assault. Meet me in the spaceport when you're ready for the attack on Earth."`
	"CN-3280" `Once you have gathered in the spaceport with the captains in charge of your fleet, Katya contacts Tomek and asks for instructions. He says, "A Wolf Pack fleet should arrive there shortly. They're carrying all the nukes we had left. They will go in first and--"`
	"CN-3281" `	Abruptly, his voice cuts off in a burst of static. "What the hell?" says Katya. She tries to reestablish a connection to Tomek, but is unable to. Confused, she says, "What's going on? Is the Navy destroying the hyperspace communications relays, now? Or jamming them somehow?"`
	"CN-3282" `	One of the communications technicians says, "They must've taken out the relays. I can't get a signal from Earth, or Tundra, or Bourne, or, well, anywhere else, for that matter, except the Altair system, right next to this one."`
	"CN-3283" `	"How do the hyperspace relays work? Is there any way around them?"`
	"CN-3284" `	"Are you sure the signal has been cut, and not just jammed?"`
	"CN-3285" `	"Only if you want to communicate at the speed of light," says the technician, "and in that case you'd need to wait a few years to get a message out to Tomek. So no, there is not any way around the relays. They're essential to the galactic communications network, which is why even at the worst parts of this war we've never seriously considered destroying them."`
	"CN-3286" `	"I don't know of any technology that could jam them," says the technician. "It's possible, but I think the more likely explanation is that they've been destroyed. Which is crazy, because the entire galactic communications network depends on them. Even at the worst parts of this war we've never seriously considered destroying them."`
	"CN-3287" `	Just then, another militia officer runs into the room. "We're under attack!" he says. "We need every ship in our fleet in orbit, right now!"`
	"CN-3288" `	"Who is attacking us? The Navy?"`
	"CN-3289" `	"Have the Wolf Pack reinforcements arrived yet?"`
	"CN-3290" `	"No," he says. "I've never seen ships like these before in my life. The Wolf Pack reinforcements just arrived in orbit, and a second later, these ships appeared and started slicing them to ribbons. If you don't get your fleet up there, there won't be anything left of them."`
	"CN-3291" `	"Yes," he says, "and a second after they arrived, this other fleet of ships appeared, unlike any ships I've ever seen before. They're tearing the Wolf Pack fleet to ribbons. If you don't get up there immediately, none of them will be left alive."`
	"CN-3292" `	You hurry to your ship and fire it up for a hasty launch...`
	"CN-3293" `The spaceport is in chaos. You eventually find Katya and report that the alien invasion fleet has been destroyed, but at a steep cost. "I'm sure we'll come to regret those losses deeply," she says. "The Wolf Pack nukes were all spent to repel that assault. And based on what we've found out here, we aren't going to be receiving reinforcements any time soon. We've somehow been cut off from the rest of human space."`
	"CN-3294" `	"How is that possible?"`
	"CN-3295" `	"Do we have any idea who these aliens are?"`
	"CN-3296" `	"I have no idea," she says, "but the aliens must have the ability to collapse hyperspace links. That's why our communications were cut. It wasn't the relays that were destroyed, it was the hyperspace pathways themselves. And meanwhile, some new links have appeared, to here." She points on your map to a star that, until now, had been completely inaccessible via hyperspace. "Deneb. That must be where the aliens came from."`
	"CN-3297" `	"We have no idea," she says. "But, they appear to have the ability to destroy hyperspace links. That's why our communications went dead; it wasn't the relays we lost, it was the pathways themselves. And, they are apparently able to create new links as well." She points to a galactic map that she had been examining when you came in; several links have been scribbled out and new ones have been drawn in. "This is the star we call Deneb," she says, pointing to a star that, until now, had been inaccessible via hyperspace. "This must be where they came from."`
	"CN-3298" `	"What do we do now?" you ask.`
	"CN-3299" `	"Well," she says, "to start out with, we need more information. I'm hoping you can somehow get past the aliens and land on <planet>, and see if they were attacked too and if so, whether anyone is still alive there. I'll stay here with the rest of the Wolf Pack in case we need to repel another attack."`
	"CN-3300" `When you land at the spaceport on <origin>, you find no evidence of violent struggle; merchant captains are walking around freely, haggling for commodities, and conversing with each other just like in any other spaceport you have visited. However, the spaceport is also being patrolled by small groups of slender, bipedal, pale-skinned aliens. Each one is holding a metal staff that looks like some sort of weapon, but none of them move to attack you.`
	"CN-3301" `	Soon after you land, you spot a man making his way towards your ship, ducking behind other ships and crates every time a group of aliens looks in his direction. If he is some sort of fugitive from them, it might be unwise to throw your lot in with him. On the other hand, he could have valuable information for you.`
	"CN-3302" `	(Stay around and talk to him.)`
	"CN-3303" `	(Take off before I draw the aliens' attention.)`
	"CN-3304" `	You start to get ready to take off, but he gestures urgently to you. Reluctantly, you decide to wait and hear what he has to say.`
	"CN-3305" `	You open your ship's hatch and allow him to come on board. "What's going on here?" you ask. "Who are these aliens?"`
	"CN-3306" `	"I'm a planet-dweller," he says, "so the first I heard of it was when these ships unlike anything I'd ever seen before came down out of the sky, and hovered over the spaceport. Then they began transmitting radio messages on all frequencies, saying that this world is now a part of the Pug Protectorate, and that we must refrain from violence and give them a portion of the goods our world produces."`
	"CN-3307" `	"Did anyone try to resist them?"`
	"CN-3308" `	"What do you think their intentions are?"`
	"CN-3309" `	"Did they explain why they cut you off from the rest of the galaxy?"`
	"CN-3310" `	"A few. Their ships aren't invulnerable; a merchant in an Argosy managed to take out one of their smaller ships when it was landed with its shields down, before they blew his ship out of the air in retaliation. And those staffs they're carrying shoot some kind of stun ray, but if you cut them, they bleed, same as any other creature." He pauses, then taps the knife that is holstered at his belt and says, "Except, they bleed blue. Pale milky blue."`
	"CN-3311" `	"Well, they want our resources, of course. And, they say they have come to bring a new era of peace and an end to all violence and conflict. I don't buy it, though; they saw that humanity was too divided to resist them, and they seized the opportunity to invade and plunder us. It's that simple."`
	"CN-3312" `	"I'd think that would be obvious. With the hyperspace links cut, there's no way for anyone from outside to assist us. And they struck at a part of human space without much in the way of militias or bounty hunters or Navy protection. And the few half-decent warships that happened to be in system when they attacked have already been destroyed trying to fight them."`
	"CN-3313" `	You thank him for the information, and prepare to return to the <system> system to talk with Katya. Perhaps the fact that the aliens are no longer attacking you means you can negotiate some sort of truce.`
	"CN-3314" `You report to Katya that the alien ships did not attack you on your trip to Shiver and back, and that the locals there seem to have consented to be governed by the aliens in exchange for peace. "We haven't had any further attacks here," she says. "Do you think it's safe to try to visit the alien home world?"`
	"CN-3315" `	"I think as long as we don't attack them, they won't attack us."`
	"CN-3316" `	"No, but I do want to get answers from them, and that may be the only way."`
	"CN-3317" `	"I'm not so sure," she says. "After all, they did attack us once before. And from what I hear from the Wolf Pack captains, the aliens were the ones who fired first. On the other hand, I don't think we have much choice, unless we want to settle down and spend the rest of our lives as alien vassals, cut off from all our friends in the rest of the galaxy."`
	"CN-3318" `	"Agreed," she says. "They may choose to destroy us, but it's not like we have any other options. I don't particularly want to settle down and spend the rest of our lives as alien vassals, cut off from all our friends in the rest of the galaxy."`
	"CN-3319" `	Katya boards your ship, and you get ready for a diplomatic visit to the alien homeworld.`
	"CN-3320" `This planet is clearly one of the native Pug worlds, and not a human world that has been occupied. The architecture is entirely alien, and you see no human ships or people here, only the aliens. But, it appears to be mostly a world for mining and factories; all the aliens are busy with their work, and none seem to speak your language or have any interest in talking with you; instead they gesture towards the sky, perhaps as a way of indicating that you should visit the other Pug planet in this system.`
	"CN-3321" `This is an entirely alien world. The buildings have strangely flowing, tapered shapes not unlike the Pug starships, and from orbit you count dozens of large cities covering a large portion of the land mass. If this were a human world, you would estimate its population at over a billion. You follow one of the Pug ships that is landing, and discover a large spaceport where a surprising number of human merchant ships are parked, in addition to the aliens.`
	"CN-3322" `	Elsewhere they have mostly ignored you, but here your ship is quickly approached by a small group of the pale-skinned, delicate aliens. The Pug are oddly proportioned, with long arms and legs but short, barrel-shaped torsos and large heads, and although they only have two legs, their gait is vaguely insectoid. "You are the ones who resisted us," one of them says. "You are not pledged to the Protectorate. Do you wish to make your vow of loyalty and peacefulness at this time?"`
	"CN-3323" `	"No, we are here to find out why you attacked us, and to demand that you leave us alone."`
	"CN-3324" `	"We are willing to make peace, but only if you give us back control of our star systems."`
	"CN-3325" `	"We have no wish to harm you," says the alien. "In time you will come to recognize that. We intervened in your war only to bring peace and to keep your species from doing great harm to itself. And we must maintain control of these systems until we are certain that you will not continue fighting if the links are restored."`
	"CN-3326" `	"If you wish us no harm, why did you slaughter our fleet?"`
	"CN-3327" `	"You have no business invading our space and interfering in our affairs, regardless of your intentions."`
	"CN-3328" `	"The fleet that was carrying nuclear weapons, weapons of genocide? They chose violence, and so they perished by violence. That is justice."`
	"CN-3329" `	Katya says, "I still don't understand what makes you think you have the right to interfere in human affairs."`
	"CN-3330" `	"'Interfere'?" says the alien. "We have 'interfered' many times before, and always you have benefited. If you do not believe us, ask those who live in the place you call the Deep. We helped them defeat the twisted half-human beings that you created in your foolish attempts to improve your race's genetic code. We have helped keep those creatures in check in the centuries since then. And we have helped in many other ways."`
	"CN-3331" `	"What do you want from us in return?"`
	"CN-3332" `	"What are you planning to do with these systems you have occupied?"`
	"CN-3333" `	"We have brought peace to this region," says the alien, "and we will continue to spread peace until violence has come to an end throughout human space. That is our only desire. All that we ask in return is a portion of the goods your worlds produce, to help offset the cost of watching over and protecting so many human worlds. And after some time, we will again allow human beings autonomous control of certain parts of your territory, when you show yourselves capable of living peacefully."`
	"CN-3334" `	"By 'spreading peace,' do you mean occupying more systems?" asks Katya.`
	"CN-3335" `	"We mean bringing an end to your war and your divisions," the alien says. "Those of your worlds and your people who have shown themselves unable to live peacefully, we must govern, to teach them peace. Any who attack us, we must destroy, because we are the bringers of peace, and whoever attacks us is not on the side of peace. Now, are you prepared to pledge your loyalty?"`
	"CN-3336" `	"I'm sorry, but you have no right to govern us."`
	"CN-3337" `	"Very well, we pledge our loyalty."`
	"CN-3338" `	"Very well, if you are not yet ready to consent to be governed by us, we will give you more time," says the alien. "In the meantime, please do not attack our ships, or we will be forced to destroy you. Which we would regret deeply." It makes an odd gesture similar to a bow, and walks off.`
	"CN-3339" `	"I am pleased to hear that," it says. "In time you will come to be thankful that you were present at the beginning of this new era of peace and prosperity for your species. And do not fear for your friends in other parts of human space who are, for a time, cut off from you. You will be reunited soon, under our protection." It makes an odd gesture similar to a bow, and walks off.`
	"CN-3340" `	"I don't like this at all," says Katya. "Let's head to <planet> and see if any of our equipment is left there from back when it was part of the front in the war against the Republic. Maybe we can find something useful there."`
	"CN-3341" `Just like Shiver, the spaceport on Oblivion is being patrolled by the Pug, and the locals seem to be resigned to their fate. Not surprisingly, you find that there are not many supplies left from when the main Free Worlds fleet was located here for a few days. But, at least the spaceport has a working repair shop and outfitter.`
	"CN-3342" `	While you are exploring the spaceport, a group of men in one of the local pubs see you walking past and gesture to you. "Hey, get in here," whispers one of them. They recognize you as a Council member, and tell you that they are leaders of a local resistance movement, biding their time and waiting for the right moment to strike back against the Pug. "Do you have a plan?" they ask.`
	"CN-3343" `	"Sorry, not yet."`
	"CN-3344" `	"We'll let you know when it's time."`
	"CN-3345" `	They seem disappointed that you aren't here to liberate them immediately, but you tell them to wait and not do anything foolish, for now, and they tell you how to contact them when you are ready. Back inside your ship, you and Katya talk. "It sounds like the aliens are planning to invade more systems," she says. "We need to get a warning out somehow. And the only way to do that is with a jump drive. We'll need to disable one of the alien ships, take out its jump drive, and install it on your ship. Then we can take your ship to <planet> and contact the Senate and the rest of the Council."`
	"CN-3346" `	"Sounds risky, but let's give it a try!"`
	"CN-3347" `	"Um, do we really want to risk getting the aliens mad at us?"`
	"CN-3348" `	"I don't think we have any other choice," she says. "Our friends out there need to know what is happening here. And maybe this, at last, will give the Navy a reason to stop fighting us and to begin working together for peace." Reluctantly, you agree.`
	"CN-3349" `Your ship creates quite a stir when it enters the system via jump drive, and the moment you've landed Alondo is waiting outside your hatch to speak with you. "What the heck is going on?" he says. "What happened to your fleet? And how in the world did you get access to a jump drive? We asked the Quarg to sell us one, but they gave us some vague response about 'not meddling in the affairs of other species.'"`
	"CN-3350" `	Katya says, "We were attacked by aliens. They cut the hyperspace links. And they're likely to invade more systems. We need to warn everyone. Including the Republic and the Navy." She explains more of the situation to him, and hands him a copy of your sensor scans of the alien ships.`
	"CN-3351" `	Alondo says, "What do you think we should do next?"`
	"CN-3352" `	"We should negotiate a ceasefire with the Navy."`
	"CN-3353" `	"We should find a way to restore those hyperspace links."`
	"CN-3354" `	Alondo says, "If they believe your story about an alien invasion, that might work. After all, if humanity is threatened by aliens, surely that takes precedence over fighting us. Only trouble is, most of the Republic seems to think that when those systems disappeared, it was some new weapon the Free Worlds had discovered. They're blaming us for it. They just captured Cebalrai and Menkent back from us, and captured Freya in the process."`
	"CN-3355" `	"Freya?" asks Katya. "How did they manage to capture her?"`
	"CN-3356" `	"She was on <planet>," he says, "setting up something she called a 'graviton detector' to analyze the collapsed hyperspace link. When the Navy arrived, we told her to get out of there, but she had just had a breakthrough in her research, and all she said was, 'To hell with your war, this is more important.'" If she's still there, she may be our best hope for figuring this out.`
	"CN-3357" `	Alondo says, "That's what Freya was working on. As soon as your fleet disappeared, she began investigating, and she went to <planet> to set up something she called a 'graviton detector' pointed towards Vega. Right before that system was taken, she sent us a message that she had found some sort of residual trace of the link, maybe a way to reopen it."`
	"CN-3358" `	"Wait," says Katya, "what do you mean, 'right before the system was taken'? By whom?"`
	"CN-3359" `	"The Navy," says Alondo. "They think the Free Worlds are behind the disappearance of those systems. And with your fleet gone, we didn't have enough ships left to resist them. Freya could have evacuated, but she stayed behind to finish her research. I believe her exact words were, 'To hell with your war, this is more important.'" If she's still there, she may be our best hope for figuring this out.`
	"CN-3360" `	"Do you think the Navy is letting her continue her research?"`
	"CN-3361" `	"Can you contact the Navy and ask them for a ceasefire?"`
	"CN-3362" `	"Or maybe interrogating her," says Alondo, "in which case they've at least discovered that we're as confused as they are about the hyperspace links being cut. I think whatever we do next, we'll need Freya, and we'll need the Navy. I'll contact them and ask them not to fire on your ship. But I can't guarantee they'll let you leave once you're in their control."`
	"CN-3363" `	"I'll contact the Navy and tell them you're coming to negotiate, and to please not fire on your ship. That's the best I can do," says Alondo.`
	"CN-3364" `	You and Katya return to your ship and prepare to make a visit to <planet>. Hopefully Freya will still be there, and the Navy will let you talk to her.`
	"CN-3365" `Surprisingly, the Navy lets you land without firing on you; the fact that you entered the system via jump drive probably made a big impression on them. But when your ship lands, it is immediately surrounded by Navy troops. Hesitantly, you and Katya disembark. You are greeted by a Navy admiral who you recognize as William Danforth, the leader of the Navy Oathkeepers. Even among the Free Worlds Danforth is spoken of with respect due to his courage and levelheadedness in battle and his leadership of countless humanitarian missions.`
	"CN-3366" `Surprisingly, the Navy lets you land without firing on you; the fact that you entered the system via jump drive probably made a big impression on them. But when your ship lands, it is immediately surrounded by Navy troops. Hesitantly, you and Katya disembark. You are greeted by Admiral Danforth, the leader of the Oathkeepers who previously assisted you to drive the Alphas and their mercenary fleet away from Poisonwood.`
	"CN-3367" `	Standing next to Danforth is someone you think might be his bodyguard: a dark-skinned woman dressed entirely in black. Even the whites of her eyes are black: when she gets closer, you can see that it is actually a scleric tattoo, an intricate Celtic knotwork pattern inked into the whites of her eyes. Surprisingly, Katya recognizes her. "Raven!" says Katya. You aren't sure if Katya sounds happy to see her, or scared.`
	"CN-3368" `	"Hello Councilor," says the woman.`
	"CN-3369" `	Danforth says, "We hear you have come from the disconnected territory, and that you bring word of a potential alien invasion. Come with us, please." He ushers you into one of the Navy Cruisers that are parked nearby, and into a room you assume is his private office; the guards check you and Katya for weapons and then leave you alone with Danforth and Raven. "Now," says Danforth, "you will answer our questions."`
	"CN-3370" `	He gestures to Raven, who walks up to you and holds out her hands. "Take my hands, please, Captain," she says.`
	"CN-3371" `	(Take her hands.)`
	"CN-3372" `	"Um, why? What are you going to do to me?"`
	"CN-3373" `	"She's a Questioner, <first>," says Katya, quietly. "One of the ones who interrogated me when I was their prisoner. Just take her hands, and tell her nothing but the truth."`
	"CN-3374" `	Reluctantly, you take her hands, and she begins asking you questions about the aliens. You answer as truthfully as you can. Holding hands with a total stranger while she stares unblinkingly into your eyes and questions you is an uncomfortably invasive and intimate experience, heightened by your suspicion that if you tell a lie, she will somehow know. By the time she is done questioning you, you are soaked in sweat and your hands are shaking. Raven turns to Danforth and says, "They're telling the truth."`
	"CN-3375" `	You and Katya both breathe a sigh of relief, and Danforth says, "Very well. Let's take them to see Miss Winters."`
	"CN-3376" `	He leads you back out of his ship and to a warehouse where people in overalls and lab coats are busy working on one of the strangest machines you have ever seen. Freya is one of them. "Katya!" she says. "<first>! Glad you could join us."`
	"CN-3377" `	"Are you working for the Navy now?"`
	"CN-3378" `	"We heard you might have a way to reopen the hyperspace links."`
	"CN-3379" `	"Well," she says, "technically I'm a prisoner. But they're helping me with my research."`
	"CN-3380" `	Katya asks, "Have you figured out how to restore the hyperspace links?"`
	"CN-3381" `	"No," says Freya, "but I at least discovered it might be possible. The links aren't severed completely, you see. There's some sort of distortion signal, actively interfering with them. If we can eliminate the interference, the links might come back. But the interference is coming from the other end."`
	"CN-3382" `	Danforth says, "Captain <last>, we will release Miss Winters to travel with you, provided that Councilor Reynolds remains here in her place. If you succeed in restoring a hyperspace link to the disconnected systems, we will release both of them. Is that an acceptable deal?"`
	"CN-3383" `	"Okay, we will agree to that."`
	"CN-3384" `	"What if Freya can't restore the link?"`
	"CN-3385" `	"Then Councilor Reynolds will remain here as our prisoner," he says.`
	"CN-3386" `	"Go, <first>," says Katya. "It's our best chance."`
	"CN-3387" `	You return to your ship with Freya, who is carrying a large collection of sensors and equipment. "Let's try <planet> first," she says, "and see if there's any alien technology there that we can use. I hope you still have some ships left in your battle fleet to help defend us."`
	"CN-3388" `Flying low over <planet> and hoping the Pug are not tracking you, you contact the resistance group you met earlier. Meanwhile, Freya says, "I've got an energy signal. Looks like the graviton pulses that are disrupting the hyperspace link." She gives you the coordinates, and you forward them to the resistance group. With some help from your ship's weapons, they are able to eliminate the Pug guards that are nearby.`
	"CN-3389" `	You land your ship, meet up with the resistance fighters, and approach the facility cautiously. "That was way too easy," says Freya. "Maybe they just didn't expect anyone to fight back against them?" The building looks vaguely like a radio transmitter, and as you get closer to it the ground seems to roll and pitch beneath your feet like the deck of a boat. "Graviton waves," says Freya. "This is it, all right. Captain, do you think you can hold off the Pug for long enough for me to figure out how this thing works?"`
	"CN-3390" `	"You aren't afraid that their ground troops will attack you?"`
	"CN-3391" `	"We can handle them," says one of the men. "As far as we know the only weapon they have is those stun sticks. Hardly a match for real bullets. Their ships are a much bigger threat."`
	"CN-3392" `	The resistance fighters tell you their own fleet will be launching shortly. You return to your ship and fire up the engines. Hopefully the ships that are left over from your attack fleet will be enough to hold off the Pug until Freya finishes her work down here...`
	"CN-3393" `	The resistance fighters tell you their own fleet will be launching shortly. You return to your ship and fire up the engines, wishing that you had managed to keep some of the ships from your attack fleet alive, and hoping you will be able to hold off the Pug until Freya finishes her work down here...`
	"CN-3394" `You land near the alien facility, and Freya meets you outside, with a large piece of alien machinery loaded onto a flatbed truck. "I hope you have room for this in your cargo hold," she says. You notice that the ground no longer seems to be rocking irregularly like before, but you still feel slightly dizzy, like the horizon will not quite stay level.`
	"CN-3395" `	"What did you figure out?"`
	"CN-3396" `	"Is the link restored yet?"`
	"CN-3397" `	She says, "I couldn't figure out exactly how this technology works, but it's some sort of graviton transmitter. I was able to switch it from sending a chaotic signal, to a coherent one. In theory, that will slowly strengthen the link. But it could take years for it to reopen, and we probably only have a few days before the Pug learn what happened here and overrun this system. So, we need to go back to <planet>, the other end of the link, and set up this thing. I think it's some sort of graviton reflector." She points to the alien equipment on the truck. "With it in place, we can set up a harmonic resonance between this star system and <system>, and in theory the link will regenerate much more quickly."`
	"CN-3398" `	"Okay, let's give it a try!"`
	"CN-3399" `	"Do you actually have any idea what you're doing?"`
	"CN-3400" `	"None whatsoever," she says. "I'm just making this up as I go along, based on what I know of hyperspace physics. And for all I know the Pug ships carry the same hyperspace disruption capabilities as this facility, and this is all for naught. But let's give it a try, okay?"`
	"CN-3401" `Although <origin> is now back under Navy control, they gladly allow your ship to land. You help Freya to set up the alien equipment and power it on. Once again you begin to feel dizzy, and the feeling slowly builds in intensity as Freya adjusts the controls. "It's working," she says. "I've got a positive feedback loop. See if you can contact Oblivion."`
	"CN-3402" `	You try to establish a communications link to the resistance fighters, and brief snatches of conversation come through, interspersed with static. After a few minutes the static begins to die down, and you can hear their voices more clearly. "It's working!" says Freya.`
	"CN-3403" `	Meanwhile, Navy and Free Worlds ships have begun pouring into the system. You suspect that the battle ahead will be a fierce one, but with a Navy war fleet on your side, it no longer feels like a hopeless cause. "The link should be strong enough for us to travel through it soon," says Freya. "Time to get back to <system>."`
	"CN-3404" `Your fleet lands on <planet>, and to your surprise the locals say that soon before your fleet arrived, all the Pug who were present on the planet departed; clearly they expected your arrival and had no desire to become your prisoners. You only have a few hours to take stock of the situation before the Navy informs you that they have detected another Pug fleet incoming...`
	"CN-3405" `When you land on <origin>, the Navy and Free Worlds crews are congratulating each other on having succeeded in resisting the alien attack. Freya says, "I guess nothing creates camaraderie faster than fighting side by side against a common enemy."`
	"CN-3406" `	"Yes, I hope our people don't get too comfortable viewing the Navy as allies."`
	"CN-3407" `	"I don't think we could have won that battle without the Navy's help. Perhaps we were wrong to think we had no need for the Republic at all."`
	"CN-3408" `	"Indeed," she says. "Still, it will be hard going back to fighting them once all this is over."`
	"CN-3409" `	"You might be right," she says. "I wonder if instead of aiming for complete independence from the Republic, all along we should have tried for something closer to what the Syndicate has: relative autonomy, but within the framework of the Republic."`
	"CN-3410" `	You meet up with Danforth, and he says, "Well, we have a beachhead now, but it's a fragile one. Miss Winters, do you think you can open up more of the hyperspace links?"`
	"CN-3411" `	Freya says, "Sure, if we retrieve the equipment from Tundra. But, the transmitter station wasn't exactly portable, so if we want to open up other systems not linked to this one, we'll have to find transmitters already installed there, too."`
	"CN-3412" `	Danforth says, "Let's start by trying to reestablish the connection from here to the Ascella system. If that works, I'll send part of my fleet to take Zeta Aquilae and see if they can secure another transmitter station. That would give us two routes into Pug space instead of the single bottleneck we have now. Captain <last>, would you be willing to travel back with Freya to <planet>?"`
	"CN-3413" `	"Sure, we can leave immediately."`
	"CN-3414" `	"What if the Pug attack here in the meantime?"`
	"CN-3415" `	"Shouldn't we just attack the Pug homeworld while we have such a big fleet here?"`
	"CN-3416" `	"Don't worry," he says, "Navy reinforcements are arriving constantly. Soon our fleet here will be twice as strong as the one we committed to yesterday's attack." Reluctantly, you agree to trust the defenses to him while you bring Freya back into Free space to help open more of the hyperlinks.`
	"CN-3417" `	"'Such a big fleet'?" he says. "This is not even a twentieth of the Navy's current fighting power. And I think we'll need many more ships before we're ready to take on the alien homeworld. But don't worry, reinforcements are arriving here constantly. You go do your part, and we'll see to ours."`
	"CN-3418" `You land on <origin> and quickly begin packing up the alien equipment that you left here earlier. Quite a few of the locals are watching you from a distance, but they seem friendly despite the fact that their world was so recently occupied by the Free Worlds against their will. Clearly your success in opening a path for the Navy to enter the disconnected region of space has become known.`
	"CN-3419" `	As you are setting up the alien equipment, Freya says, "Doesn't this all seem a little too... neat, to you? I mean, that the aliens close off the hyperlinks but then for some reason leave behind the exact equipment that we need to gradually reopen them? And that the requisite technology is so simple, a transmitter and a reflector? It all fits together way too well."`
	"CN-3420" `	"Are you suggesting that the aliens intended for us to do exactly what we're doing?"`
	"CN-3421" `	"It does all seem odd, that we could have any success at all fighting a species that is apparently so sophisticated."`
	"CN-3422" `	She nods. "I have the uncomfortable feeling that we're caught up in a game we don't understand," she says. "And before we make the next move, we should get more information."`
	"CN-3423" `	"From whom?" you ask.`
	"CN-3424" `	"The Quarg," she says. "We're just a few jumps away from their space, and they claim to know what's going on throughout the galaxy. And when this crisis started and we asked them for a jump drive, they said they didn't want to meddle in the affairs of other species, which means maybe they knew another species was involved here."`
	"CN-3425" `	"Our mission is urgent. We should just continue to Arabia."`
	"CN-3426" `	"Okay, let's take a detour to talk with the Quarg."`
	"CN-3427" `	"Well," she says, "you're the captain, I'll leave that choice up to you."`
	"CN-3428" `	"Thanks," she says, "Let's just hope that we can get some real answers."`
	"CN-3429" `You land on the Quarg station, but neither of you knows what to do next. How do you locate a Quarg diplomat? Do they even have such a thing? As you and Freya stand in the hangar looking somewhat lost, one of the Quarg approaches you and says, "These ones have questions?"`
	"CN-3430" `	Freya says, "We've been attacked by aliens who call themselves the Pug. We're wondering what you know about them."`
	"CN-3431" `	Quarg skin is normally entirely gray, as is their clothing, but several patches of skin on the Quarg's face turn red at the word "Pug." You've heard theories that this is a sign of emotion in the Quarg, but no one knows what emotion precisely. Anger? Embarrassment? The Quarg you are speaking with simply says, "Come," and leads you to a nook in one of the main hallways, where another Quarg stands behind a desk. You are struck by how little you know about this species: are you speaking to a tour guide, or to a diplomat? Is this the governor of the station, or just an expert in human languages? The Quarg behind the desk says, "Do you have questions for me?"`
	"CN-3432" `	"Can you help us to fight the Pug?"`
	"CN-3433" `	"Can you give us information about the Pug?"`
	"CN-3434" `	"No," it says. "Long ago we tried to resist the Pug. In retribution, they broke one of our rings." It points out the window of the station at the half-finished ringworld. "This ring is half complete, and it has taken a thousand of your years to build. The rings are our most precious creations, nearly impossible to destroy, but the Pug know how to twist and cut the fabric of space itself."`
	"CN-3435" `	"So you've encountered the Pug before?" asks Freya. "You know about them?"`
	"CN-3436" `	"The Pug have meddled with the affairs of many species in this galaxy," it says, "but they are not native to it. They came here through artificial wormholes: a technology that not even the Drak possess. Their actions are unpredictable. They are either entirely illogical, or operating on a logic so far above ours that it appears as nonsense to us. They claim it is the latter: that they operate on some special knowledge of time and future."`
	"CN-3437" `	"If they're so advanced, do we have any chance of defeating them?"`
	"CN-3438" `	"Do you think the Drak would join us in fighting them?"`
	"CN-3439" `	"Yes," it says. "In battle the Pug always respond with just enough force that their opponent has a fair chance at victory."`
	"CN-3440" `	Freya is confused. "What do you mean?" she says.`
	"CN-3441" `	"No," it says. "The Drak do not interfere in a war unless their rules are broken. And, it would not help you anyway; the Pug always adjust the strength of their fleet to give their opponent what they consider to be fair odds."`
	"CN-3442" `	"Wait," says Freya, "you're saying they would intentionally attack us with a weaker force instead of using all their strength and guaranteeing victory?"`
	"CN-3443" `	"War is a game to the Pug," the Quarg says. "They are a strange species. Even if they start a war, their goal may not be to win it, but to lose in a certain way. We have seen them lose battles against species far less advanced than your own, even though they had weapons that would have guaranteed them victory. If they want war, you must play their game, and if you play their game, they may allow you to win."`
	"CN-3444" `	"That makes no sense," says Freya. "They would die for the sake of a game?"`
	"CN-3445" `	The Quarg pauses for a moment as if struggling for words. "I am myself, and also I am Quarg. You are yourselves, and also you are human. But we think perhaps a Pug is Pug first, and then also itself."`
	"CN-3446" `	"Their identity is communal, rather than individual?" says Freya.`
	"CN-3447" `	"Indeed. And because they are so deeply connected, they perceive all things as being connected to them. At least, that is the best understanding we have been able to gain of their species."`
	"CN-3448" `	You talk for a while longer, but gain no more information of value.`
	"CN-3449" `You help Freya to unload and set up the reflector equipment, then contact the Navy on Oblivion and instruct them to point the transmitter in your direction. A few minutes later Admiral Danforth contacts you. "This link appears to be returning too," he says. "So, let's move on. We're going to make an attack on the <system> system, now, and we would welcome your assistance in this battle." You leave the equipment on <origin> and return to your ship with Freya.`
	"CN-3450" `You find Admiral Danforth supervising the repairs of the damaged Navy ships. "Glad you survived that battle!" he says. "These alien ships are much more advanced than ours, but we outnumber them, so now that we've established a strong beachhead I think we actually have a chance at defeating them. The only problem is, the majority of our fleet is still up north. With the Vega system cut off, our supply lines are having to go all the way around through the Dirt Belt. So I'd like to propose liberating Vega next."`
	"CN-3451" `	"That does sound like a good strategic choice."`
	"CN-3452" `	"How will your fleet get to Vega without traveling through the Pug home system? That system is swarming with their ships."`
	"CN-3453" `	Danforth says, "During the battle, we managed to salvage jump drives from a few of the Pug ships. We've installed them in three of our Carriers. Hopefully, with your help, that will be enough to overcome any resistance in the Vega system. Then Miss Winters can work her magic with the hyperlinks again, and we'll be able to bring a massive reinforcement fleet from Sol."`
	"CN-3454" `	"Sounds good to me," says Freya. "I wish more of our own ships had jump drives, so we could assist you."`
	"CN-3455" `	"Indeed," says Danforth. "That's why it's so important for Captain <last>'s ship to be part of this battle. When it's all over, I want to be able to tell Parliament that this war was won by the Free Worlds and the Navy fighting side by side every step of the way. And I hope you will be able to tell your Senate the same thing, so that they will be more amenable to a compromise between us."`
	"CN-3456" `	"I'm glad to hear you say that. Your fleet is so much stronger than ours that you could easily take all the credit."`
	"CN-3457" `	"We were the ones who discovered the aliens and the way to restore the hyperspace links. The Free Worlds deserve the real credit here."`
	"CN-3458" `	"I don't want the credit," he says, "I want peace." He wishes you the best of luck in your attack on Vega, and says to contact him as soon as the link is restored and the reinforcements are ready.`
	"CN-3459" `	"Captain," he says, "the point isn't who deserves more credit. The point is, how do we tell this story in a way that makes people on my side and on yours more willing to make peace with each other? That's all I care about." He wishes you the best of luck in your attack on Vega, and says to contact him as soon as the link is restored and the reinforcements are ready.`
	"CN-3460" `Once again, the Pug seem to have anticipated your attack and evacuated all their personnel from the planet before your arrival. It's a little disconcerting that they seem to have planned for events to unfold in exactly this way. Once again, you find one of the transmitter stations, abandoned on <origin> but still in working order, and inside the station Freya locates another one of the "reflectors" that she needs in order to complete the link. "I don't get it," she says. "They should've destroyed all this before they left."`
	"CN-3461" `	"Yes, I hope we're not playing into some sort of trap."`
	"CN-3462" `	"Well, let's just be thankful they didn't."`
	"CN-3463" `	"I suppose," she says. "I just don't like not understanding things, and I do not understand these aliens at all."`
	"CN-3464" `	"Indeed," she says. "It's hard to imagine that a species so advanced could be making so many tactical errors."`
	"CN-3465" `	You load the equipment onto your ship, and Freya says, "Let's set it up on <planet>, rather than Earth. I don't think the graviton radiation is harmful to human beings, but there's no point in placing it on such a densely populated planet."`
	"CN-3466" `As soon as Freya has set up her equipment and verified that it is working, you contact Admiral Danforth. "We're on Mars," you tell him, "and we should have the hyperspace link to Vega restored soon."`
	"CN-3467" `	"Excellent," he says. "Please contact your Council and arrange for your fleet to strike from the south at the same time as the fleet from Vega jumps in from the north."`
	"CN-3468" `	You contact Tomek and tell him the Navy is ready for a final assault, and he agrees to send as many ships as he can spare to join you. Now it's time to return to <planet> and await the attack signal.`
	"CN-3469" `You enter the Deneb system expecting a massive Pug battle fleet to be waiting for you. Instead, it is entirely deserted. Also, your sensors are picking up some sort of anomaly outside the orbit of the outermost planet.`
	"CN-3470" `The tiny spaceport on Silver is packed with people as more and more Navy ships come in for a landing. The Navy admirals have decided that there is no sense in delaying: you will be launching an attack on the Pug homeworld in the morning. Despite your success so far in battling the Pug, you know that if their entire fleet opposes you, even the Navy may not be strong enough to defeat them. This may be the last time you see many of these officers and crew members alive.`
	"CN-3471" `	Everyone prepares for death in different ways. The spaceport's pub is packed, with the crowd spilling out into the hallway and loud music blasting. The chapel is equally full, and the sound of whispered prayers and chanting clashes with the dance music from the pub. Through the doorway of the chapel you see some people sitting cross-legged on the floor and others kneeling on prayer rugs, as the various cultures that make up the Republic do their best to share the space.`
	"CN-3472" `	You find Freya sitting in a secluded nook on the upper floor of the spaceport building, watching the stars and the drifting sand out the window. "Ready for the last battle, Captain?" she asks.`
	"CN-3473" `	"Sure, with the Navy at our backs I think we've got a good chance."`
	"CN-3474" `	"As ready as I'll ever be, I guess."`
	"CN-3475" `	She laughs. "I suppose that's the best we can hope for. Do you mind if I ride in your ship tomorrow, rather than one of the others? If this is the end, I'd rather face it with people I know." You agree. She turns back to look out the window.`
	"CN-3476" `	Since Freya seems to want to be alone, you return downstairs, and discover that a sizable Oathkeeper fleet has arrived. In the main vestibule of the spaceport, an Oathkeeper officer is leading a group in qigong meditation. And surprisingly, you spot Admiral Danforth sitting with the Muslim prayer group and chanting in fluent Arabic. Meanwhile, the party outside the pub continues.`
	"CN-3477" `	Eventually morning comes, and you prepare your ship for the assault on the Pug homeworld...`
	"CN-3478" `As you bring your fleet in for a landing, you find that the main Pug spaceport is surprisingly empty. However, a group of Pug children are gathered in a loose circle on one of the landing pads. They appear to be playing some sort of game; they ignore your fleet overhead.`
	"CN-3479" `	(Avoid harming them and land.)`
	"CN-3480" `	You fire a single shot into the center of the circle, leaving a dark scar on the landing pad and sending a plume of dust and smoke into the air. The children continue their game, as if nothing has happened.`
	"CN-3481" `	You land your ship near the circle of Pug children. They are bouncing a ball back and forth between them, and studiously ignoring your presence. Aside from the sound of the ball striking the pavement, the entire city is eerily quiet. "This is really weird," says Freya.`
	"CN-3482" `	(Explore the city.)`
	"CN-3483" `	(Join the game.)`
	"CN-3484" `	You step into the circle and make a grab for the ball, but it passes straight through your fingers. Freya reaches out to touch one of the children, and her hand, too, passes through them. "Some sort of holographic projection," she says.`
	"CN-3485" `	The Navy ships are beginning to land and send crew out to explore. You and Freya walk into the city, passing by a pair of adult Pug who sit at a table outside what looks like some sort of cafe, playing a board game with black and white stones on a hexagonal grid. You check and find that they, too, are a holographic illusion.`
	"CN-3486" `	The Navy ships are beginning to land and send crew out to explore. You and Freya walk into the city. The streets are mostly deserted, but on one of them you pass by a pair of adult Pug who sit at a table outside what looks like some sort of cafe, playing a board game with black and white stones on a hexagonal grid.`
	"CN-3487" `	(Try to talk to them.)`
	"CN-3488" `	You throw a punch at one of the Pug at the table, but your fist passes right through its head as if nothing is there. Surprised, Freya reaches out to touch the other one, and again her hand passes through them. "Some sort of holographic projection," she says. You continue exploring.`
	"CN-3489" `	You try to talk to the Pug, but they, like the children, are ignoring you completely; they do not even seem to be aware of your existence. Finally, Freya reaches out to shake one of them by the shoulder, and her hand passes straight through it. Surprised, she waves her hands back and forth through both of them. "Some sort of holographic projection," she says.`
	"CN-3490" `	You continue to explore for a while. Aside from the illusions, the city seems to be deserted. "Let's check inside one of the houses," Freya says at last. You climb up the steps to what looks like an apartment building and find that all the doors are unlocked. Inside one of the living spaces, you explore the different rooms and find that the water fixtures and electricity are working, but a thick layer of dust covers everything. Freya, meanwhile, is staring at one of the electrical outlets. "<first>," she says, "do you see anything odd about this?"`
	"CN-3491" `	"No, it's just an ordinary electric outlet."`
	"CN-3492" `	"Everything here is odd. The city, the holograms, all of it."`
	"CN-3493" `	She says, "It's an ordinary, human style electrical outlet. Human. In an alien city. And the steps we came up to get here: the Pug have legs half again as long as ours. But the tread spacing was at the normal human height. This building wasn't made for the Pug. It was made for us."`
	"CN-3494" `	Reports begin coming in as the Navy explores the rest of the planet, and they are all finding the same thing: the cities are abandoned, many of them with signs that they were never inhabited in the first place. The first time you visited this planet, you thought it must have a billion inhabitants, but now it seems that its true population was less than a million - all of whom have apparently departed to somewhere beyond the wormhole.`
	"CN-3495" `	Freya says, "Let's get back to the spaceport and meet up with the admirals."`
	"CN-3496" `You find Admiral Danforth inspecting the Pug spaceport. "This is all very odd," he says. "I'm glad the aliens appear to have left, but I wish we knew where they came from and whether they're likely to return."`
	"CN-3497" `	Freya says, "What should we do now?"`
	"CN-3498" `	"I've contacted New Austria and told them that Councilor Reynolds is free to leave," he says. "She told me that your Senate has agreed to the Free Worlds being a semi-autonomous district of the Republic, similar to the Syndicate systems. She also asked that you and Captain <last> meet up with her and Alondo Gruyere on Earth, where they will be meeting with Parliament. I sent a report to Earth that places a very heavy emphasis on the role that the Free Worlds played in this victory, so Parliament ought to be quite willing to negotiate with you."`
	"CN-3499" `	"Thank you. It's been an honor to fight alongside you."`
	"CN-3500" `	"Last time we visited Parliament, they violated our safe passage agreement and put us on trial."`
	"CN-3501" `	"No, the honor has been mine," he says. "Feel free to drop by and visit me on Farpoint any time you're in the area."`
	"CN-3502" `	"Trust me," he says, "you won't need to worry about that this time around. Having an alien attack so close to Earth be thwarted through the assistance of the Free Worlds has put Parliament in a very... receptive mood. Good luck, Captain <last>, and I hope our paths will cross again."`
	"CN-3503" `You arrive in the Parliament building just as Alondo and Katya have finished meeting with them. "Good news," says Katya. "We're all officially pardoned. And you, Captain <last>, have become something of a hero."`
	"CN-3504" `	"Better yet," says Alondo, "the war with the Republic is over. We agreed to limiting our territory to its current size, and to a very minor tax to cover the cost of Navy protection if the aliens attack again or some other major catastrophe strikes. In return, the Free Worlds have been granted autonomy from the Republic."`
	"CN-3505" `	"Also," says Katya, "as their own expression of gratitude, the Syndicate members of Parliament have offered to make some of their new technology, developed during the war, available to us at an affordable price."`
	"CN-3506" `	"That's very generous of them."`
	"CN-3507" `	"I wonder if that's their way of buying our support and keeping us quiet about the supposed defector."`
	"CN-3508" `	"Maybe so," says Alondo. "The CEO of the Syndicate, Alastair Korban, is also resigning. Perhaps the events are related. In other news, now that the war has ended, and the Pug have been defeated, the Senate has voted to dissolve the Council, leaving us free to return to civilian life. However, they've also agreed to pay you, <first>, a reduced salary in honor of your service. So, what do you think you will do next?"`
	"CN-3509" `	"Build a merchant fleet and live a safe, quiet life."`
	"CN-3510" `	"See if folks in the fringe worlds need any help against the pirates."`
	"CN-3511" `	"Use my jump drive to explore beyond human space."`
	"CN-3512" `	"Well, we all wish you the best of luck," says Freya. "We would never have won this war without you. Be sure to stay in touch." You hug each of them goodbye, and return to your ship. What you do next is up to you...`
	"CN-3513" `On your way to the spaceport, you fill Katya in on the state of the war. She says that Intelligence has been keeping her in a relatively comfortable but totally isolated cell; she's not even sure what world it was on. From the fact that her questioners seemed to be growing increasingly frustrated about the Free Worlds, she knew that you were still managing to resist the Navy, but they did not share any details with her.`
	"CN-3514" `	You meet up with Raven in a small tea shop, close enough to the spaceport that the tables shake each time another Free Worlds capital ship arrives in response to the Syndicate attack. "Thank you for allowing me to land here," says Raven. "Now, what questions do you have for me?"`
	"CN-3515" `	"Are we at peace with the Republic now?"`
	"CN-3516" `	"Are you some sort of mind reader?"`
	"CN-3517" `	"What exactly is the job of Navy Intelligence?"`
	"CN-3518" `	"Well," she says, "only Parliament can decide that. But the Navy has been ordered not to attack Free Worlds ships, and the news that Sawyer brought has become public knowledge, so you'll find that most Republic worlds will be willing to welcome you, now."`
	"CN-3519" `	She laughs, and says, "No, I'm just a really good listener." When she sees that you're not satisfied with that answer, she elaborates. "The official term for us is 'empaths.' We have a heightened ability to absorb the emotional state of those around us. That, combined with extensive training, makes us better lie detectors than any machine. But if you're asking whether my abilities work through body language and vocal cues, or through some sort of mystical powers, honestly none of us knows that for sure."`
	"CN-3520" `	She says, "I assume your real question is, why does Navy Intelligence exist at all, since the Republic already has a very powerful, well-funded, and nearly omniscient Department of Intelligence that exists independent of the Navy? The short answer is, we don't trust them. Someone needs to watch the watchers."`
	"CN-3521" `	Katya asks, "What do we do now? Will Sawyer's evidence be enough to end this war?"`
	"CN-3522" `	Raven says, "Possibly. Especially because the Syndicate incriminated themselves by chasing after him. But the Syndicate has so much power in Parliament that the more evidence we can collect, the better. And that means we should visit the world where he said the development was done, and look for more evidence there."`
	"CN-3523" `	Katya says, "Captain <last>, is Ijs Springborn still working for the Free Worlds?"`
	"CN-3524" `	You tell her that the last you heard, Ijs was helping to found a new university on <planet>. She says, "We should bring him with us. Raven, will you be traveling with us too?"`
	"CN-3525" `	"Yes," she says. "I'll tell my ship and crew to get ready."`
	"CN-3526" `The moment you land Katya is eager to visit the Conservatory and find Ijs. In the time that he has been here, it has grown into a small but bustling community, with crowds of students walking from building to building carrying backpacks and wrapped in thick coats. You find Ijs' office; Katya knocks and says, "Professor Springborn, are you having office hours right now?"`
	"CN-3527" `	He recognizes her voice immediately and comes running out of the office to hug her. "Katya! You're free! Is the war over?"`
	"CN-3528" `	"Not quite," she says, "but we've found the bombers. Apparently the whole thing was sponsored by the Syndicate. Do you still have those isotopic fingerprints we collected back when this whole thing began?"`
	"CN-3529" `	Ijs quickly finds the data and collects his equipment. "I'll just have to let them know I need a substitute for a while," he says.`
	"CN-3530" `	Back at the spaceport, you meet up with Raven. "Here's the deal," she says. "We need to get to <planet>, destroy any Syndicate ships that are watching, and then land and hope we have time to collect evidence before more of them arrive. Unless you've got a ramscoop, we may need to bribe our way onto a few Syndicate worlds to refuel. And of course, I'll be counting on you to help keep my ship safe. Any questions?"`
	"CN-3531" `	"No, I'm ready to go!"`
	"CN-3532" `	"Won't they have destroyed any evidence long before we get there?"`
	"CN-3533" `	"Probably," she says, "but if they did any testing there, we should be able to pick up the residue. Or at least, my people will be able to, because they've got military grade Navy equipment."`
	"CN-3534" `	"So do we," says Ijs, sheepishly.`
	"CN-3535" `	Raven looks surprised for a moment, then says, "Never mind, I'm sure there's a good story of how you got your hands on that equipment, but it can wait for another time. Let's get moving."`
	"CN-3536" `You skim low over the surface of <origin>, with the airlock slightly open to allow Ijs to collect atmospheric samples. He's dressed in a pressure suit, and over the suit's radio he says, "Any residue that's here will be very faint. Just a few more minutes."`
	"CN-3537" `	Sawyer directs you to the site where the secret development took place. Nothing is left but a wide and slightly overgrown clearing. After checking your radar and seeing no incoming ships, you risk landing. Sawyer says that there were buildings here a few years ago, but now not even their foundations remain, and a sensor sweep for metallic objects turns up nothing, not even as small as a single nail.`
	"CN-3538" `	However, Ijs points out a few subtle signs of human habitation. "A clearing like this would normally form in a fire," he says, "but notice, no fire scars on the trees on the edges of the clearing."`
	"CN-3539" `	Raven says, "And our geophysical radar is picking up structures underground. Several deep shafts, and rock that's been stressed and fractured by a large explosion. They did a good job of hiding everything else, but if you scar a planet that badly, it doesn't go away. The stones speak."`
	"CN-3540" `	As you continue inspecting the site, suddenly Raven's copilot shouts out the door of her Gunboat at you. "Syndicate ships have entered the system! We need to get back to Earth with the evidence, quickly!"`
	"CN-3541" `As you came fleeing out of Syndicate space with their ships in hot pursuit, you couldn't help noticing that no Republic ships moved to help you or attack your pursuers. Apparently, they are not ready to strike the Syndicate until Parliament has made a decision. As you are waiting for Parliament to hear your evidence, Katya asks you quietly, "So, how are you feeling about our chances here?"`
	"CN-3542" `	"I think our evidence is undeniable. There's no way we could fail to convince them."`
	"CN-3543" `	"I'm worried about how much power the Syndicate has in Parliament. What if they refuse to believe us?"`
	"CN-3544" `	You continue to feel optimistic as Sawyer presents his story and his evidence, corroborated by the additional data collected by Ijs and by Raven's team. But as the members of Parliament begin questioning Sawyer, nearly all their questions sound more like an attack on him than an attempt to learn more about the Syndicate's involvement in the terrorist attacks.`
	"CN-3545" `	Your pessimism turns out to be justified. The hearing begins well enough, with Sawyer's testimony and the additional evidence collected by Ijs and by Raven's team. But when the floor is opened for questions, nearly every question the members of Parliament ask seems intended not to get to the bottom of the terrorist plot, but to attack or discredit Sawyer.`
	"CN-3546" `	You can't help but realize how many people here represent Syndicate worlds. One of them, an older man, asks, "What possible reason would the Syndicate have to launch such an attack?"`
	"CN-3547" `	Sawyer says, "They have complex mathematical models of the galactic economy, and those models predicted a coming recession, the worst in centuries. This war forestalled that recession. From the perspective of someone who values economic growth above all else, war was a better alternative than recession."`
	"CN-3548" `	"That's utter nonsense," says the man. "That's the sort of absurd conspiracy theory that someone with no understanding of business would invent."`
	"CN-3549" `	The rest of the hearing is little better, but as you are leaving one of the representatives from the Deep shakes your hand, and you feel a piece of paper being pressed into your palm. You pocket it quietly and open it once you have returned to your ship. It says, "Visit us on Valhalla."`
	"CN-3550" `You receive a brief message from Alondo: "Good news, Captain! As a gesture of good faith the Navy is beginning to pull out of Rastaban and Delta Sagittarii. Those worlds will revert to our control soon. Be sure to tell the others. And, tell Katya I'm very glad she's free and am looking forward to seeing her." You pass on his message to Katya and Ijs.`
	"CN-3551" `When you land on Valhalla, a man shows up at your ship and introduces himself as Edrick Flint, the governor of Valhalla. He invites all of you to join him for dinner at his home, which turns out to be an apartment on the twenty-third floor of one of the downtown skyscrapers. There, he introduces you to several other regional governors and authorities.`
	"CN-3552" `	"You may be aware," Edrick says, "that the Deep was self-governing before the formation of the Republic. Indeed, during some of the darkest centuries of the space age, the Deep stood out as a beacon of civilization, a place where piracy was not tolerated and all travelers were safe. When we joined the Republic, we retained the authority to police our own territory, and that authority includes the right to track down fugitives who have fled beyond our usual jurisdiction."`
	"CN-3553" `	"You're suggesting a 'police action' against the Syndicate?"`
	"CN-3554" `	"Wait, before we talk details, are you saying that you believe Sawyer's testimony against the Syndicate?"`
	"CN-3555" `	"Everyone believes him," says one of the other governors, "throughout human space, and in Parliament too. We can all see that the evidence is undeniable. What people don't agree on is how to respond to that evidence."`
	"CN-3556" `	"We want to see justice done," says Edrick. "Our proposal is that a fleet under our jurisdiction, but joined by Free Worlds and Oathkeeper vessels, will travel into the Core and arrest at least one of the Syndicate masterminds behind the terrorist attacks. Such an action would satisfy the technical requirements of legality provided that immediately prior to the arrest, one of our courts hears Sawyer's testimony and pronounces that Syndicate individual guilty."`
	"CN-3557" `	"'Technically legal' sounds to me like a euphemism for 'something we know full well is going to get us into trouble.'"`
	"CN-3558" `	"How exactly is a fleet of warships going to travel through Syndicate space without a massive battle?"`
	"CN-3559" `	Ijs laughs at that. "Relax, Captain. I've been doing 'technically legal' stuff for years. It only occasionally goes disastrously wrong. But governor, if the Syndicate sees you coming, you'll need a full-scale war fleet, not just a handful of ships."`
	"CN-3560" `	"That's why the fleet will be composed of ships from three different organizations," says Edrick. "You will find a reason to travel to Earth with perhaps one of your fancy new Dreadnoughts as an escort. When you arrive, there will just happen to be an Oathkeeper patrol passing through the same system. And a merchant convoy from the Deep. With its own set of escorts, of course."`
	"CN-3561" `	"We'd need to know exactly where and on what planet our target lives, prior to entering Syndicate space," says Katya. "And, if you want to have a court trial immediately prior to the arrest, it sounds like Sawyer will need to stay here."`
	"CN-3562" `	"Indeed," says Edrick, "but I assure you, he is safer from the Syndicate here than anywhere else in human space, your own territory included. As for locating a target, that's why the Oathkeepers have requested that you visit them on Farpoint."`
	"CN-3563" `	The rest of the evening is a more casual time for conversation, with plenty of good food and wine.`
	"CN-3564" `	The rest of the evening is a more casual time for conversation, with plenty of good food and wine. Alondo sends you a message to inform you that Tarazed has decided to officially join the Free Worlds after having received word of the Parliament hearing, news that brings joy to Katya and Ijs.`
	"CN-3565" `	At one point, Edrick pulls you aside and says, "I've requested that you be granted access to some of the new technology that was developed here during the course of the war. In particular, please find space on your ship for a ramscoop; you will need it for your next mission. And also, here." He hands you a data card. "This is a copy of Sawyer's evidence, in case something happens here. Keep it very, very safe."`
	"CN-3566" `On Farpoint, you are met by none other than the famous leader of the Oathkeepers, Admiral William Danforth. Even among the Free Worlds Danforth is spoken of with respect due to his courage and levelheadedness in battle and his leadership of countless humanitarian missions.`
	"CN-3567" `On Farpoint, you are met by Admiral Danforth, the leader of the Oathkeepers who previously assisted you to drive the Alphas and their mercenary fleet away from Poisonwood. He is glad to see you again, and you express your sympathy over the loss of Commander Nguyen; Danforth tells you that his killer was never found.`
	"CN-3568" `	Ijs and Katya introduce themselves to Danforth, and Katya says, "Sir, I was a child on Hope when the colony was evacuated. Your ship carried my family to safety, and I've never forgotten how every night during our journey, you would walk through the cargo bay where we were staying and check to make sure all our needs were met. I've never had a chance before now to thank you in person."`
	"CN-3569" `	Danforth is surprised. "Councilor Reynolds," he says, "thank you. I followed your career in Parliament with some interest, but it is a shame that we never met in person until now. But I am glad we have this chance to work together at last."`
	"CN-3570" `	Raven says, "Governor Edrick mentioned a plan for tracking down the Syndicate executives who were behind the attacks in the Castor and Pollux systems."`
	"CN-3571" `	"Indeed," says Danforth. "Southeast of here is a region of uninhabited star systems, a sort of back entrance into Syndicate space. Few ships travel through there, because there is nowhere to refuel, but with a ramscoop or enough fuel capacity, travel is possible. One of the first inhabited worlds on the other side is the lawless world of Stormhold. There, you can surely find a contact who knows enough about the inner workings of the Syndicate to tell you the home of at least a few of our targets... for a price." He hands Katya a large stack of credit chips.`
	"CN-3572" `	Raven says, "I'm going to stay here with the Oathkeepers. Captain <last>, it's been a pleasure working with you. We're counting on you to fetch us this information and return here as quickly as possible."`
	"CN-3573" `You land near one of the small villages on Stormhold, and after handing out a few small bribes from the money Danforth gave you, finally one of the villagers recalls that a local gang of pirates is led by a former Syndicate manager. With some trepidation, you fly to his stronghold, and he agrees to "do business" with you.`
	"CN-3574" `	Katya shows him Sawyer's list of names. "So, these are the bad boys, huh?" he says. Clearly the news of Sawyer's revelations has spread even to this remote world. He looks through the list, and is able to tell you where three of the five men live. "I'd love to see all these bastards taken down," he says.`
	"CN-3575" `	You give him the rest of Danforth's money and thank him for helping you - and ask that he keep your visit secret. "No problem," he says. As you are leaving, he adds, "Also, Mister Springborn... you're my hero, man. Glad you're still finding ways to pester the Syndicate." Ijs seems pleasantly surprised to be recognized.`
	"CN-3576" `When you land back on Farpoint, Danforth eagerly meets you and asks what information you were able to obtain. You tell him. "So," he says, "one executive on Foundry, and one on Hephaestus. Both of those are core Syndicate planets, with billions of people on them. No way that would work. But this financial guy, Alexander Soylent... your contact says he lives on a giant yacht that sails around the ocean on Nimbus. Now, that's a much more inviting target. And from what Sawyer says, the Syndicate's financial arm were the ones who decided war would be beneficial in the first place."`
	"CN-3577" `	As you're talking, one of Danforth's officers runs into the room. "Sir," he says, "we're detecting a pirate fleet incoming."`
	"CN-3578" `	Danforth swears. "This is my real job, of course," he explains, "defending the North from pirate invasion. This isn't the first attack we've had to repulse, and lately Parliament has been finding reasons to reassign my best ships elsewhere. Captain <last>, would you be willing to join the defense fleet? We'll finish this conversation once they've been driven off."`
	"CN-3579" `	You hurry to your ship and join the defenders...`
	"CN-3580" `As you are landing, Katya tells you, "<first>, we just received a message from the Free Worlds Senate. They've arranged for a Republic embassy to be set up on Bourne, and a Free Worlds embassy on Earth. We've been asked to meet the ambassadors on Earth and escort them to Bourne."`
	"CN-3581" `	A few minutes later, Admiral Danforth arrives at your ship. "Captain <last>," he says, "I'd like to thank you for your assistance." He hands you a million-credit chip.`
	"CN-3582" `	"Thank you, sir."`
	"CN-3583" `	"Wow, this is the biggest planetary defense bounty I've ever heard of."`
	"CN-3584" `	"That's purely for you as a private captain, to compensate you for your assistance," he says. "I wouldn't want you to think that I am in any way giving financial support to the Free Worlds, since that would be illegal."`
	"CN-3585" `	"Of course not, sir," you say. "Thank you."`
	"CN-3586" `	"Don't mention it," he says, with a wink. "And now, I think it's best that you head to Earth and pick up those ambassadors. From what I hear, now that Raven is not traveling with you, people are beginning to ask questions about what this Free Worlds captain is doing flying all around Republic space unescorted."`
	"CN-3587" `Unfortunately, the Republic ambassadors turn out to match all your worst stereotypes of Republic diplomats: dressed in gaudy, impractical clothing, and carrying an absurd amount of luggage. At first you are worried about whether you have enough space for them, but one of them explains that they would not dream of traveling in your dirty old ship; they will be traveling in style, in a Star Queen luxury liner, and your only duty is to ensure their safety. You have little choice but to acquiesce, even though you think they would be far safer on your own ship.`

	"CN-3589" `Unfortunately, the Republic ambassadors turn out to match all your worst stereotypes of Republic diplomats: dressed in gaudy, impractical clothing, and carrying an absurd amount of luggage. At first you are worried about whether you have enough space for them, but one of them explains that they would not dream of traveling in your dirty old ship; they will be traveling in style, in a Star Queen luxury liner, and your only duty is to ensure their safety. Despite operating your own Star Queen luxury liner, you have little choice but to acquiesce. Perhaps they'd rather travel with a Republic-staffed crew, even if they would be far safer on your own ship.`
	"CN-3590" `From the way Alondo's eyes light up when he sees Katya, you can tell that all he wants to do right now is to get caught up with her and celebrate her freedom. But he plays the part of a good diplomat, escorting the Republic ambassadors to their new quarters. Along the way he makes pleasant small talk with them, complimenting their style and sophistication. Knowing him as well as you do, you can tell he is saving up his more scathing comments about them until they are out of earshot.`
	"CN-3591" `	The moment they are dealt with he gives Katya a hug and says, "Katya! So good to have you back with us. The Council has five members once more. I assume you've been told about Tomek's... departure, and <first>'s promotion?" She nods.`
	"CN-3592" `	Alondo says, "Unfortunately, we don't have any ambassadors of our own picked out yet. The Senate insists on selecting them, and you wouldn't believe how slowly Senate deliberations move. They've interviewed half a dozen candidates so far, and found none to their liking. It pains me to say this, but we may have succeeded in creating a bureaucracy every bit as inefficient as the one we rebelled against."`
	"CN-3593" `	"No problem. The important thing is, we're at peace, so their decisions can take as long as they need to."`
	"CN-3594" `	"Have you volunteered to be one of the ambassadors? You're an obvious choice."`
	"CN-3595" `	"What do we do while we're waiting?"`
	"CN-3596" `	"At peace for now," says Ijs, "but so far a peace without justice. When the time is ripe, we will strike against the Syndicate."`
	"CN-3597" `	Alondo laughs. "No, that's no work for me," he says. "The ambassadors, as prestigious as their role may seem, are little more than a symbolic gesture. And being cooped up in an embassy on a single planet while things of importance are taking place elsewhere is hardly a job I aspire to."`
	"CN-3598" `	"So, what will we do while we're waiting for the Senate to pick the ambassadors?" you ask.`
	"CN-3599" `	Alondo says, "We should use this time of peace well, to prepare for another battle ahead. Those Syndicate ships on New Tibet had equipment I've never seen before, and who knows what else the Syndicate has up their sleeves - especially if they've begun producing nuclear weapons. Captain <last>, you should take this time to make sure your ship is as well armed as possible for our next strike. Ijs and Katya, what will you do with this time?"`
	"CN-3600" `	Katya glances at Ijs and then says, "I would certainly welcome a small sabbatical, and a chance to spend time together and catch up on all we've missed. Professor Springborn, do you think the Conservatory would extend your leave of absence long enough for us to make a trip to <planet>?"`
	"CN-3601" `	Ijs laughs. "That sounds wonderful, Councilor," he says. "<first>, do you think you could bring us there on your way to wherever you go next?"`
	"CN-3602" `	You tell him you would be glad to, and you all get ready for yet another journey together.`
	"CN-3603" `You drop Ijs and Katya off on Skymoot, and wish them well. They both seem eager for a chance to relax, enjoy one another's company, and forget about matters of galactic importance for a while. "We'll see you soon, <first>," says Katya. "Just be sure your ship is in good fighting shape when the time comes to bring the Syndicate to justice."`
	"CN-3604" `You receive a coded message from Alondo: "The Senate has finished selecting the ambassadors, and all is in readiness for our other work as well. Please meet us back on <planet> as soon as you can."`
	"CN-3605" `When you land on Bourne you discover that Katya and Ijs have already been back there for a week. Alondo is with them, too. "We just couldn't stay away from the action for long," says Ijs.`
	"CN-3606" `	The Star Queen luxury liner that brought the Earth ambassadors to Bourne is still parked in a somewhat out-of-the-way hangar. "Don't worry, Captain," says Katya, "there's no way our ambassadors would travel in something as gaudy as that. They've requisitioned a Dreadnought instead. A good ship to remind the people of Earth that we have a strong fleet of our own."`
	"CN-3607" `	"Not to mention," says Ijs, "a good ship to take part in our strike against the Syndicate."`
	"CN-3608" `	Alondo introduces you to the Free Worlds ambassadors who will be returning to Earth. "I've already contacted Governor Flint and Admiral Danforth," he says. "Their ships will be arriving in the Sol system about the same time as yours. Good luck, Captain." You help Ijs and Katya load their luggage onto your ship, and tell the Dreadnought carrying the ambassadors to be ready to follow you.`
	"CN-3609" `You land on Earth and make a show of being very busy ensuring that the Free Worlds ambassadors are comfortable and well cared for, until finally you receive a secure message from Edrick. He tells you that the convoy from the Deep is landing on Mars right now, and an Oathkeeper Cruiser is visiting the shipyard on Luna. As soon as you are ready, you can take off, and travel together into the heart of Syndicate space.`
	"CN-3610" `	You make an excuse to depart, and return to your ship. "Well," says Ijs, "this is it. If we're lucky, they won't see us coming, but no matter what, getting back out of Syndicate space will be a nightmare. Good luck, all."`
	"CN-3611" `As you approach the planet, your ships spread out and begin scanning the ocean surface for a yacht matching the description you were given. After a few tense moments of wondering if Soylent is off-world at the moment, you find the ship.`
	"CN-3612" `	With neither deflector shields nor any weaponry that you can see, the yacht clearly poses no threat to an armed starship. The Aerie that Edrick sent launches its four fighters; when they land on the yacht's deck, armed police officers emerge. Meanwhile your fleet is ready to open fire at the first sign of resistance.`
	"CN-3613" `	The officers soon radio you that they have found Soylent, and they bring him aboard your ship. Amid all the confusion, you notice a figure in diving gear who jumps off the rear of the yacht and disappears beneath the waves - one of Soylent's men, trying to escape. But since his leader is now in your custody, and your mission is accomplished, you see no reason to chase after him.`
	"CN-3614" `	The Oathkeeper captain sends you a brief message: "Your first priority is to reach the Deep with the prisoner. Our crew is prepared to serve as a rearguard, staying behind if necessary to ensure that you survive. Good luck, Captain."`
	"CN-3615" `There is a warning light on your ship's main control panel that has never turned on. It is a relic of the dark age of galactic travel, part of a sensor system that is built into every starship, to detect incoming nuclear warheads. You had almost forgotten it even existed, because you have never seen it flash.`
	"CN-3616" `	It begins flashing now.`
	"CN-3617" `Edrick meets you soon after you land, and oversees the transfer of your captive to a local, well-defended jail. You tell him about your narrow escape from Syndicate space, and the fact that the Syndicate used nuclear weapons against your fleet, in violation of the rules of war that humankind has abided by for centuries.`
	"CN-3618" `	"Unfortunately," says Edrick, "all the other witnesses to that event were allied with the Syndicate, so people will believe whatever they want to believe. Already the Syndicate is spreading stories about a renegade fleet of rebels and extremists that attacked one of their worlds in an assassination attempt on one of their leaders. Worse, they've taken this as an excuse to send a massive Syndicate fleet to the Sol system - to defend Earth from attack, they say."`
	"CN-3619" `	"Sounds more like the goal is to intimidate Parliament into siding with the Syndicate."`
	"CN-3620" `	"Are they attacking the Republic ships, or are they still technically at peace?"`
	"CN-3621" `	"We should attack them immediately, before they are able to harm anyone on Earth."`
	"CN-3622" `	"Indeed," he says.`
	"CN-3623" `	"Apparently no one is shooting at anyone else," says Edrick, "but that could change at any minute. You may be aware that there is very little love for the Syndicate among Navy admirals. The only thing keeping the Navy from attacking the Syndicate now is the Navy's devotion to order and obedience; they won't start a new war without Parliament's approval, and of course that approval is unlikely with Syndicate warships circling overhead."`
	"CN-3624" `	"That would be a terrible idea," he says. "First, it would play right into their narrative. And second, humanity is on the very brink now of shattering into half a dozen different splinters: the Deep, the Free Worlds, the Navy, the Syndicate each on their own against the rest. I don't want to be the one who gives the order that causes that to happen."`
	"CN-3625" `	Katya says, "It sounds like if the Free Worlds enters Sol, we'll be the spark that sets off an explosion. So, we'll have to trust the Deep, or the Navy, or someone else to try to defuse the situation. Meanwhile, I suggest we return to Free space and muster our entire fleet, to assist the Navy against the Syndicate if it comes to that. JJ ought to be on <planet>; we can meet up with him there."`
	"CN-3626" `As soon as you land on <origin>, JJ comes running up to your ship. "<first>," he says, "we have serious trouble. A few minutes ago I received a distress call from Rand, then their transmission was cut off. I'm afraid the Syndicate may be expanding into our space."`
	"CN-3627" `	"Is our fleet ready to respond?"`
	"CN-3628" `	"What should we do?"`
	"CN-3629" `	"Our fleet is still scattered throughout this quadrant," he says, "and I'll need Katya to command a part of it. Right now I just need you to travel to Rand, if possible, and find out what's going on. It could just be a communications malfunction, but I seriously doubt it. Meanwhile, Katya and Ijs can help me with organizing the fleet."`
	"CN-3630" `Based on your previous maps of this sector, there should be a hyperspace link from here to the Rasalhague system. But your sensors show nothing. Something has severed the link.`
	"CN-3631" `The Ascella system used to be linked to Rasalhague and Zeta Aquilae, but no longer. Either the Syndicate has discovered the ability to alter hyperspace links, and is using it to block the Free Worlds from interfering with them, or you have a much stranger problem on your hands...`
	"CN-3632" `You land on Tundra and ask around to see if anyone knows why the hyperspace link to Rasalhague is gone. Everyone is talking about it, but no one seems to have a believable theory. "Maybe that odd star out past Rasalhague, the one you can't jump to, went nova," suggests one captain.`
	"CN-3633" `	You also talk with several people who mention that the northern lights have been spectacular the last few days, unlike anything they had ever seen before.`
	"CN-3634" `You land on Arabia and try to find someone who knows what is going on, but everyone seems just as confused as you are. The spaceport authorities say that their sensors picked up a massive graviton surge when the hyperlinks collapsed, but they are not sure whether the surge caused the collapse, or was a result of it.`
	"CN-3635" `	One merchant captain claims that he was in orbit at the time, and he saw a ship unlike anything he'd ever seen before, that appeared and then disappeared in a flash "just like those Quarg ships do." You aren't sure whether or not to believe him.`
	"CN-3636" `You receive an urgent message from JJ: "Captain <last>, return to New Tibet at once! We've received word that the Syndicate is somehow severing their hyperspace connections to the rest of human space. We're calling an emergency Council meeting, to convene as soon as you arrive here."`
	"CN-3637" `By the time you arrive, Alondo and Freya have joined JJ and Katya on New Tibet; the entire Council is present. "Here's the story," says JJ. "A few weeks ago, hyperspace links on the edge of Syndicate space began collapsing. We weren't sure why. Then, more recently, the Syndicate fleet that had been occupying the Sol system retreated to Syndicate space - and the moment the last of their ships left, the hyperspace link disappeared behind them. We think the Syndicate has found a way to alter hyperspace links and is using it to wall themselves in, to escape retribution from the rest of humanity now that their guilt is so conclusively proven."`
	"CN-3638" `	"Why don't we just let them go, then?"`
	"CN-3639" `	"What is the Republic planning to do in response?"`
	"CN-3640" `	Freya says, "Somehow, they managed to annex several of our systems in the process of walling themselves off - our two best suppliers of heavy metals. That suggests that any of our systems on the border with the Syndicate may be taken over, and made completely inaccessible to us, at any time. That's not a risk we can take."`
	"CN-3641" `	"And it's not just that," says Katya. "Think of how many workers are on Syndicate worlds right now, having left their families on a different planet in order to go earn money in a Syndicate factory for a few years. Imagine a future where those families are forever divided."`
	"CN-3642" `	"They're in a panic," says Katya. "Earth is on the very boundary of the area that was cut off, and that means at any moment, they could choose to cut off humanity's homeworld from the rest of human space. And we don't even know if it is possible to restore the links once they have been cut."`
	"CN-3643" `	"According to our embassy," says Alondo, "all communications links with Syndicate space have been cut. The Net relies on hyperspace links to transmit messages, and there are no transmitter relays in the uninhabited systems that now form the only remaining link to Syndicate space."`
	"CN-3644" `	JJ says, "The Senate has agreed that we must put our differences with the Republic aside, and meet with Parliament immediately to deal with this crisis. <first>, we're asking you and Alondo to go to Earth, and lend your assistance as you see fit. Any questions?"`
	"CN-3645" `	"How do we know the Syndicate is really behind this?"`
	"CN-3646" `	"We don't," says JJ, "but this all certainly plays out very well for them; their section of the galaxy has suddenly become a very defensible enclave. And the timing of that fleet leaving, and then the link closing - it's too much to be a coincidence. But we can't learn anything for sure by staying here talking; you must go to Earth."`
	"CN-3647" `A palpable sense of fear and near-panic hangs over the spaceport on Earth. At any minute, this system that serves as the very hub of human government could disappear into the same unknown abyss that has swallowed up its neighbors.`
	"CN-3648" `	Parliament is eager now to meet with you, and to receive whatever assistance you may be able to offer. As Alondo stands in front of the chamber asking the members of Parliament for more information, they answer him with respect and deference, far different from how you have been treated here in the past. You learn that although one link remains open to Syndicate space, no one has dared to travel through it. Given the pace at which the other links were cut, they fear that the one remaining link will disappear any day now.`
	"CN-3649" `	As the conversation continues, it eventually becomes clear why you have been called here: the Republic wants you to take on the risk none of them is willing to face, and travel through to Syndicate space to reason with their leaders.`
	"CN-3650" `	"If this is what it takes to keep human space from being torn into fragments, I will risk my ship to go meet with the Syndicate."`
	"CN-3651" `	"This sounds like a job for the Navy, not for me. I can't risk being trapped in hostile Syndicate space forever."`
	"CN-3652" `	"Did the Syndicate communicate anything to you before the links were cut that might help us guess at their intentions?"`
	"CN-3653" `	One of the members of Parliament says, "It's all terribly confusing. Our sources in Syndicate space were reporting massive fleet movements just before it happened. We also heard rumors of Syndicate fleets fighting each other. Some sort of internal power struggle."`
	"CN-3654" `	Another man speaks up and adds, "We had also been aware for some time that the Syndicate had gained access to alien technology, through encounters with a nomadic alien species currently inhabiting the galactic core. They may have found a way to use that technology to alter the links." From the surprised expressions on the faces of many of the other members of Parliament, it's clear that this information is new to them.`
	"CN-3655" `	"Very well, we will accept this mission."`
	"CN-3656" `	"Sorry, I'm not willing to risk my ship over this."`
	"CN-3657" `	Alondo says, quietly but firmly, "Captain <last>, the Senate has asked you to assist the Republic in this matter, and the Council agrees. I know the risk is great, but you swore to serve the Free Worlds, and the Free Worlds are now commanding you to take this mission."`
	"CN-3658" `	"Very well," you say, "I accept. But I'm afraid of what will happen when we reach Syndicate space."`
	"CN-3659" `	Parliament thanks you for your willingness to serve, and you and Alondo hurry back to your ship. "There's no telling how long the link will remain open," he says. "So, we must hurry to the Syndicate headquarters on <planet> immediately."`
	"CN-3660" `Oddly, when you land on <origin> you find that the people here are in as much of a state of confusion and fear as back on Earth. Either no one knows what is going on and why they have been nearly cut off from the rest of human space, or every single person you talk to is united in a conspiracy to feign ignorance. They urge you to continue your journey to meet with the Syndicate executives on Foundry. "Maybe you can talk some sense into them," says one merchant captain. "First the nukes, and now this. The extremist faction within the Syndicate is getting out of hand."`
	"CN-3661" `As you are coming in for a landing you announce yourselves to the spaceport authorities as diplomatic representatives of the Free Worlds and the Republic. The moment you land, a Syndicate employee meets you and escorts you to their headquarters, to the incredibly fancy corner office of Alastair Korban, the CEO of the entire Syndicate Corporation. "I'm very glad you've come," says Alastair. "It seems unlikely that we can defeat this attack unless we work together."`
	"CN-3662" `	"Wait," says Alondo, "you're saying this whole thing is not the Syndicate's doing?"`
	"CN-3663" `	Alastair seems taken aback. "Of course not. Seal off valuable trade routes? Why would we do that?"`
	"CN-3664" `	"We thought you were walling yourselves off to escape prosecution for your acts of terrorism."`
	"CN-3665" `	"If it isn't you, then who is it?"`
	"CN-3666" `	Alastair says, "That terrorism was the action of a certain extremist faction that we have since purged from our ranks, and we were in the process of hunting down the perpetrators. Your raid on Nimbus interrupted those plans and gave the others a chance to go into hiding, but we will see to it that they, too, are brought to justice. But now, we need to put the past behind us and figure out how to work together against our common foe."`
	"CN-3667" `	"I think you're lying. You had years to turn over those extremists, and you did not."`
	"CN-3668" `	"Very well. Who is this common foe? You seem to know more than we do."`
	"CN-3669" `	"We are deeply, deeply sorry for the actions of these extremists," says Alastair, "and for our own inaction in turning them in. We had hoped that we could deal with them internally, without it becoming public knowledge that we were connected with them. That was a foolish choice for us to make, and we are more than willing to make whatever reparations you demand."`
	"CN-3670" `	"You are aware that you started a war, right? Every Navy or Free Worlds militia member who died fighting each other is your responsibility."`
	"CN-3671" `	"Okay, we'll deal with that later. For now, tell us everything you know about whoever is attacking you."`
	"CN-3672" `	"<first>, enough," says Alondo. "We'll sort out the reparations later. For now, we need to know who is severing the hyperspace links."`
	"CN-3673" `	"They are called the Pug," says Alastair, "an irrational alien species that previously inhabited a single star system in between Syndicate and Republic space. They have since expanded their territory to include all the human systems neighboring their own star, and have essentially made those human worlds into their slaves."`
	"CN-3674" `	"How do you know this?" asks Alondo.`
	"CN-3675" `	Alastair pauses for a minute as if trying to figure out the best way to explain himself, then says, "One of our ships traveled to the occupied systems, using a jump drive that we... acquired... from another alien species." He seems to realize how unlikely that sounds, and backpedals. "For years we've been dealing with occasional raids from a species called the Korath. As best we can tell, they're nomadic scavengers and pirates who currently inhabit the galactic core. Over the years we have disabled several of their ships and stolen their jump drives."`
	"CN-3676" `	"Did it not occur to you that attacking the Korath might anger other alien species?"`
	"CN-3677" `	"Wait, now there are two different alien species involved? Your story is getting even more convoluted and unbelievable."`
	"CN-3678" `	"That is unlikely. The equipment we stole from the Korath is most likely something they stole from someone else."`
	"CN-3679" `	"Yes," he says, "it is a very convoluted mess. Which is why we need your help."`
	"CN-3680" `	"Assuming you're telling the truth," says Alondo, "what sort of help do you need from us?"`
	"CN-3681" `	Alastair says, "We have only seven jump drives, so whatever fleet attacks the Pug can only contain seven ships. Unless the Quarg or someone else will give you more drives, I suppose. So those ships must be stronger than any ship we have here in Syndicate space, because the Pug are very strong. They obliterated our fleet that had been occupying the Sol system, even though that fleet was armed with the majority of our nuclear arsenal."`
	"CN-3682" `	"You're saying you'll provide the jump drives, and we'll provide the ships? Sounds fair enough."`
	"CN-3683" `	"Wait, you're saying that your fleet that was in orbit around Earth... was armed with nuclear weapons? Are you genocidal?"`
	"CN-3684" `	Alastair seems like the kind of person who seldom admits he is wrong, but your question definitely flusters him. "Okay, okay, I admit, we've been making one bad decision after another ever since... well, since that first bad decision. It just got out of control. We thought the Navy was going to raid us and put us all behind bars. We thought we needed a deterrent. It was stupid. I admit it, okay? Now please, let's just move on. We need your capital ships, and you need our jump drives."`
	"CN-3685" `	"Hold on," says Alondo, "I have one condition to add. You will give us one of your jump drives immediately. We will install it in our ship and verify that you are telling the truth about the Pug. If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
	"CN-3686" `	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says. "Our Systems division was trying to discover the secret behind them, with little success. If you travel there, I'll tell them to install one of the drives in your ship."`
	"CN-3687" `You are directed to land in a hangar some distance away from the spaceport, in a cluster of buildings owned by Syndicated Systems. A team of engineers meets you and quickly and efficiently removes your hyperdrive and replaces it with a strange, alien-looking device that you assume must be a jump drive. "Now, be careful with your fuel gauge," one of them tells you. "This thing guzzles twice as much fuel per jump as an ordinary hyperdrive, and you don't want to become stranded while outside human space."`
	"CN-3688" `You are directed to land in a hangar some distance away from the spaceport, in a cluster of buildings owned by Syndicated Systems. A team of engineers meets you and quickly and efficiently removes your scram drive and replaces it with a strange, alien-looking device that you assume must be a jump drive. "Now, be careful with your fuel gauge," one of them tells you. "This thing guzzles twice as much fuel per jump as an ordinary hyperdrive, and you don't want to become stranded while outside human space."`
	"CN-3689" `You are directed to land in a hangar some distance away from the spaceport, in a cluster of buildings owned by Syndicated Systems. A team of engineers meets you and asks if they can look over your ship; a few minutes later, one of them says in surprise, "You've already got a jump drive! How did you manage that?" Since you don't need their equipment, they urge you to head directly for Pug space and continue your mission.`
	"CN-3690" `Somehow, you've misplaced or lost the jump drive needed to continue the Free Worlds story! If you are unable to find your jump drive, you should revert to the autosave or another earlier snapshot of the game.`
	"CN-3691" `When you land at the spaceport on <origin>, you find no evidence of violent struggle; merchant captains are walking around freely, haggling for commodities, and conversing with each other just like in any other spaceport you have visited. However, the spaceport is also being patrolled by small groups of slender, bipedal, pale-skinned aliens who you assume are the Pug. Each one is holding a metal staff: probably some sort of weapon.`
	"CN-3692" `	Soon after you land, you spot a man making his way towards your ship, ducking behind other ships and crates every time a group of Pug look in his direction. If he is some sort of fugitive from them, it might be unwise to throw your lot in with him. On the other hand, he could have valuable information for you.`
	"CN-3693" `	(Take off before I draw the Pug's attention.)`
	"CN-3694" `You open your ship's hatch and allow him to come on board. "You came from outside, didn't you?" he says. "Outside of occupied space, I mean." You nod.`
	"CN-3695" `	"What's going on here?" asks Alondo. "Who are these aliens?"`
	"CN-3696" `	"Where did they come from originally?" asks Alondo.`
	"CN-3697" `	"From a star system that was always a neighbor of ours, but wasn't linked to us or to any other part of human space. We always just assumed it was an uninhabited system, but it turns out they were there all along, biding their time, waiting for a good opportunity to attack us."`
	"CN-3698" `	"Well," says Alondo, "they didn't attack us when we jumped into this system. Perhaps we should go to their home system and see what they have to say for themselves."`
	"CN-3699" `	Elsewhere they have mostly ignored you, but here your ship is quickly approached by a small group of the pale-skinned, delicate aliens. The Pug are oddly proportioned, with long arms and legs but short, barrel-shaped torsos and large heads, and although they only have two legs, their gait is vaguely insectoid. "You came from outside," one of them says. "You are not pledged to the Protectorate. Do you wish to make your vow of loyalty and peacefulness at this time?"`
	"CN-3700" `	"If you wish us no harm, why did you slaughter the Syndicate fleet?"`
	"CN-3701" `	"The fleet that was carrying nuclear weapons, weapons of genocide? The fleet that, when we demanded their surrender, instead attacked us with those weapons? We offered them a place in the Protectorate, but they chose violence instead, and so they perished by violence. That is justice."`
	"CN-3702" `	Alondo says, "I still don't understand what makes you think you have the right to interfere in human affairs."`
	"CN-3703" `	"By 'spreading peace,' do you mean occupying more systems?" asks Alondo.`
	"CN-3704" `	"We mean bringing an end to your war and your divisions," the alien says. "Those of your worlds and your people who have shown themselves unable to live peacefully, we must govern, to teach them peace. Any who attack us, we must destroy, because we are the bringers of peace, and whoever attacks us is not on the side of peace. And so we will send you back to your people now, to tell them that they have nothing to fear, and that they should await our peace and our protection."`
	"CN-3705" `	The aliens appear to think the conversation is over; they walk away and leave you puzzling over what they said. "We should report back to Earth," says Alondo. "This situation is far beyond what we can handle alone."`
	"CN-3706" `As you are coming in for a landing, you contact Edrick Flint and see if he's available to talk. A few minutes later, you and Alondo are sitting with him in his office in the government center. "I assume you've heard about the alien invasion?" says Alondo. Edrick nods. "The aliens claimed that they had dealt with the Deep in the past. Do you know anything about that?"`
	"CN-3707" `	Edrick says, "Can you describe what these aliens look like?"`
	"CN-3708" `	"Pale skin, delicate physique, most of them a little under two meters tall," says Alondo. "Long legs, short torsos. And they probably have blue blood."`
	"CN-3709" `	Edrick pauses for several seconds, then says, "Yes, we had contact with a species that matches that description, back during the Alpha Wars. Some of the folk traditions about 'elves' that still persist here in the Deep are a result of those encounters."`
	"CN-3710" `	"Do you know what they wanted from humanity, back then?"`
	"CN-3711" `	"What strengths and weaknesses do their ships have?"`
	"CN-3712" `	"If the stories are true, all they wanted was to help us win the war against the Alphas," says Edrick. "They never asked for any payment, except that they borrowed some of our ships, packed them full of alien technology, and fought alongside our ships, masquerading as human ships. They also gave us beam weapon technology; five centuries later, we've only just reached the point where we understand that technology well enough to improve on it."`
	"CN-3713" `	"What do you know about their warships?" asks Alondo.`
	"CN-3714" `	"I know that they had a technology that allowed their shields to recharge very quickly," says Edrick. "So to destroy one of their ships would require a considerable amount of concentrated firepower. But are you sure we need to fight them? My people have believed for generations that the 'elven folk' were a friendly species, not a hostile one."`
	"CN-3715" `	"They seem intent on taking over all of human space and forcing us to submit to their authority. So we must fight them."`
	"CN-3716" `	"It's possible that they think they are helping us right now, by interrupting our civil war, but all the same we must fight back."`
	"CN-3717" `	Edrick looks disappointed at that. "I understand. I believe that they honestly think they are doing what is best for us, but clearly we cannot tolerate this invasion. Good luck, Captain." He dismisses you.`
	"CN-3718" `When you land on the station, Alondo says, "From what I understand of Quarg diplomacy, we're just supposed to ask any one of them to direct us to someone who can answer our questions." He walks up to a Quarg who is standing near your docking bay and says, "Excuse me, can you lead us to someone we can talk to?"`
	"CN-3719" `	It nods and gestures for you to follow, and leads you to a nook in one of the main hallways, where another Quarg stands behind a desk. You are struck by how little you know about this species: are you speaking to a tour guide, or to a diplomat? Were you led to this individual because this is the governor of the station, or just because this is one who speaks human languages? The Quarg behind the desk says, "Do you have questions for me?"`
	"CN-3720" `	"No," it says. Several stripes of skin on its gray face turn a dull red; you have heard that this might indicate sadness, or embarrassment, or possibly anger - one more thing about the Quarg that no one understands well. "Long ago we tried to resist the Pug," it says. "In retribution, they broke one of our rings." It points out the window of the station at the half-finished ringworld. "This ring is half complete, and it has taken a thousand of your years to build. The rings are our most precious creations, nearly impossible to destroy, but the Pug know how to twist and cut the fabric of space itself."`
	"CN-3721" `	"So you've encountered the Pug before?" asks Alondo.`
	"CN-3722" `	The Quarg is silent for a long moment. "The Pug have meddled with the affairs of many species in this galaxy," it says, "but they are not native to it. They came here through artificial wormholes: a technology that not even the Drak possess. Their actions are unpredictable. They claim to be acting on a special knowledge of future events, but we do not know if that knowledge is genuine or only an excuse to play tricks on other species."`
	"CN-3723" `	Alondo is confused. "What do you mean?" he asks.`
	"CN-3724" `	"Wait," says Alondo, "you're saying they would intentionally attack us with a weaker force instead of using all their strength and guaranteeing victory?"`
	"CN-3725" `	"That makes no sense," says Alondo. "They would die for the sake of a game?"`
	"CN-3726" `	"Their identity is communal, rather than individual?" says Alondo.`
	"CN-3727" `	"Thank you for your time."`
	"CN-3728" `	"Is there any chance you could give us some jump drives, so we can bring a bigger fleet against the Pug?"`
	"CN-3729" `	"No, I apologize," it says. "We see that you have somehow gained access to a jump drive, and we will not take it away from you, but we also cannot give your species more of them."`
	"CN-3730" `Your ship caused quite a stir when it entered the Sol system via jump drive. Fortunately Parliament allowed you to land in one of their private hangars, but even so a few press drones managed to follow your ship into the hangar and have cameras pointed at you from the moment you and Alondo disembark.`
	"CN-3731" `	You report to Parliament that the hyperspace links are being cut not by the Syndicate, but by an alien species, and that the Syndicate has offered to supply jump drives for an attack fleet if the Republic and the Free Worlds will supply the ships. You also report that the aliens' intention is to spread out to occupy more of human space and to demand a fraction of the resource production of all human planets, supposedly in the name of bringing "peace."`
	"CN-3732" `	One of the senators asks, "Do you think we have any chance of defeating the aliens?"`
	"CN-3733" `	"It's possible. They all live in a single star system, so we outnumber them."`
	"CN-3734" `	"It's unlikely. If we have any options other than fighting them, we should explore those options."`
	"CN-3735" `	"I think we have no choice," says one of the older members. "Even if it is a losing battle, we can't let the human race be enslaved without a fight."`
	"CN-3736" `	They have many other questions after that; you answer them as best you can, and leave them with full copies of your sensor logs of the alien ships and planets. Parliament agrees that the next step is for you to convince the Free Worlds to contribute two Dreadnoughts to the attack fleet. "Also," one of the members of Parliament says, "maybe you could talk to those aliens who live down in your part of space, see if they can help us out in any way. It sure would be handy if the Pug turn out to be an enemy of theirs."`
	"CN-3737" `	During the hearing, you refrained from mentioning that the Pug claimed to have assisted the Deep in the past, but once you are back in your ship Alondo says, "Maybe we should also visit Valhalla and see if Governor Flint has any information for us."`
	"CN-3738" `Freya meets you soon after you land. "I've heard the news," she says. "I talked to the Senate, and they think that I should travel with you during your assault on the Pug, in case I can help figure out their technology, maybe even how to restore the hyperspace links. And they say they need Alondo back here to do diplomatic visits and help keep people from panicking."`
	"CN-3739" `	"I guess that makes sense," says Alondo.`
	"CN-3740" `	"Also," says Freya, "the Senate approved a raise for you, <first>. Your new salary will be seventeen thousand credits a day. I hope that means you'll be able to go into battle against the Pug with the strongest ship possible, because I suspect we'll need all the firepower we can get."`
	"CN-3741" `	Alondo wishes you the best of luck and leaves to catch a transport to Bourne, while Freya takes you to the spaceport and introduces you to the captains of the two Dreadnoughts that have volunteered to fight the Pug. She also asks you all sorts of technical questions: what sort of propulsion and energy sources the Pug seem to use, what their weapon capabilities are, and whether you saw any sign of the technology that was used to destroy the hyperspace links. You have a hard time answering her, but are glad that she will be with you this time to see the aliens firsthand.`
	"CN-3742" `You land at the Republic Navy Yard on Geminus escorting the two Dreadnoughts that are the Free Worlds contribution to the war against the Pug. You are met by the shipyard supervisor and a team of engineers who are preparing the Navy ships to join you. "So, these are your Dreadnoughts," one of them says. "I'm glad to finally have the chance to see one up close. I don't suppose one of the captains would be willing to give me a tour."`
	"CN-3743" `	"Um, we're right in the middle of resisting an alien invasion, here."`
	"CN-3744" `	"Sorry, we aren't authorized to share military secrets with you."`
	"CN-3745" `	"Sure, I'm sure we could arrange something."`
	"CN-3746" `	Freya laughs. "Give him a break, <first>. He's just thinking like an engineer, rather than a tactician. I mean, I'd certainly jump at the chance to tour a Cruiser even at a time like this."`
	"CN-3747" `	The supervisor seems irked that his engineers are more interested in exploring nifty new ship technology than in the task at hand, but he grudgingly offers to give you a tour of the Navy Yard in exchange for letting his engineers take a closer look at the Dreadnoughts. Freya whispers to you, "Just think of this as another step toward peace and reconciliation."`
	"CN-3748" `	The new shipyard is some distance away from the old one, which is still in ruins, a radioactive crater a few kilometers away from the spaceport. "The attack happened at night," says the supervisor. "Three hundred and forty-seven people were killed. If the attack had been during working hours, that number would have been in the thousands. We're recovering some metal from the old shipyard, but other than that it's a total loss. The radiation is slowly dying down, though."`
	"CN-3749" `	There is deep anger in his voice as he speaks. You are glad that the Free Worlds have been proved innocent of involvement in the attack, but you suspect that on the worlds that were bombed, most people will not accept peace with the Syndicate on any terms except the full surrender of all the Syndicate personnel who were responsible.`
	"CN-3750" `	When they're done giving you the tour, you return to the spaceport. The supervisor and the team of engineers wish you the best of luck, and depart.`
	"CN-3751" `The Syndicate directs you to land your ships in the private hangars for Syndicated Systems. Once you have landed, they quickly work to install jump drives in the Navy and Free Worlds ships. As they work, you hear one of the workers saying to another, "Golly, I'd forgotten how big those Navy ships are. Makes a Protector look puny by comparison, doesn't it?"`
	"CN-3752" `	Once the work is done, you meet with a senior Syndicate executive named Marco Bugati. "I really hope this works," he says, "because these are the only jump drives we've been able to acquire. If your fleet is destroyed, we will have lost access to the occupied territory entirely."`
	"CN-3753" `	Once the work is done, you meet with a senior Syndicate executive named Marco Bugati. "I really hope this works," he says, "because these are the only jump drives we've been able to acquire, though you seem to have picked one up yourself; I'd like to have a chat with you and find out how, if we all survive this. I can tell you, that extra ship we've got thanks to the spare jump drive may be pivotal. But if your fleet is destroyed, we will have lost access to the occupied territory entirely."`
	"CN-3754" `	You gather your fleet and prepare for an assault on Delta Capricorni, which is the occupied star system closest to Syndicate space.`
	"CN-3755" `[Take good care of this fleet: if ships are disabled, board them to "repair" them once the battle is over. And, when jumping into battle, remember that you can hold down the jump key to get all your ships ready to jump simultaneously, so no single ship enters the system first and bears the brunt of the enemy fire.]`
	"CN-3756" `Along with the remaining ships from the combined attack fleet, you land at the main spaceport on <origin>. The other ships are carrying trained soldiers and equipment for planetary defense: ground-based laser turrets, surface to air missiles, and tracking radar for incoming ships. The soldiers have come armed and ready to fight the Pug on the ground if necessary, but it turns out that all the Pug who were here took off in one of the ships that were trying to repulse your attack.`
	"CN-3757" `You have liberated this planet, but with your entire fleet destroyed your victory may be short-lived. Still, you have no option but to continue on and try your best. Fortunately, it turns out that none of the Pug are left on the ground here on Maker; they all left the planet to join in the fleet that you just destroyed. So at least you don't have a land war to worry about.`
	"CN-3758" `	Freya has some good news: she is picking up very faint, intermittent signals from the hyperspace communications relay back in the Markab system. "That means the link may not be closed completely," she says, "or at least, there's some residue remaining."`
	"CN-3759" `	Freya directs you to fly over the planet and survey the buildings and equipment that the Pug left behind, and after searching for a while you discover an alien building that vaguely resembles a radio transmitter. You land nearby, and as you approach the building on foot, you feel as if the ground beneath you is heaving and rolling like the deck of a ship on choppy seas. "Graviton distortions," she says. "This may be it, the equipment they used to disrupt the hyperspace links. It will take me a while to figure out how it works, though."`
	"CN-3760" `	You agree that she will stay here to try to figure out the alien technology, while you do your best to defend the planet and to keep the Pug from retaking it.`
	"CN-3761" `Freya meets you soon after you land. She has brought with her a large piece of alien machinery, mounted on a flat-bed truck for easy transportation. "I shut down the transmitter," she says, "and sure enough, the signal from Markab started to gradually become stronger. I think it was somehow jamming or suppressing the hyperspace link, rather than completely severing it. So then I found that the transmitter has a different setting, where instead of sending random graviton noise, it sends a steady, harmonic pulse. And that accelerated the process of reopening the link."`
	"CN-3762" `	"Great! How soon until the link is open again?"`
	"CN-3763" `	"Are you sure we should be playing with alien technology we don't understand?"`
	"CN-3764" `	"Do we really have any better options?" she asks. "Without reinforcements, how many more Pug attacks do you really think you can survive? Besides, there's a certain logic and balance to the rules of physics, so even when dealing with something we can't understand, sometimes intuition can guide us." She pauses for a second, and says, "And sometimes intuition steers us terribly wrong, but let's not think about that right now."`
	"CN-3765" `	"So, you succeeded in opening the link?" you say.`
	"CN-3766" `	"Well, that's the bad news," she says. "At this rate, it will take several years to reopen the connection. And I doubt this method would work at all if there weren't still the residual link in place. But that's where this equipment comes in."`
	"CN-3767" `	She points to the alien machine. "This machine is like the transmitter, but much simpler. The transmitter somehow redirects a planet's gravity spaceward; what this machine does is reflect a graviton beam back where it comes from. If we can mount the reflector on Hephaestus, and align them both very precisely, we can set up a standing wave between the two that will regenerate the hyperspace link much more quickly. Or for all I know it might create an artificial singularity that destroys us all. I'm mostly flying blind here."`
	"CN-3768" `	"Well, I guess we should give it a try."`
	"CN-3769" `	"Sounds risky. Are there any other options we could try?"`
	"CN-3770" `	"No," she says, "no, there are not. Sorry."`
	"CN-3771" `	You load the reflector onto your ship, and get ready to travel to Hephaestus. You suspect that the Pug are going to try to stop you, once they realize what is happening...`
	"CN-3772" `Freya sent detailed instructions with the reflector for where it should be set up and how it should be adjusted to interface with the transmitter back in Pug space. You hand it over to a team of Syndicate engineers, who seem quite capable and confident that they can make it work; you suspect that these are the same engineers who have been playing with equipment stolen from the Korath, so they are no strangers to alien technology.`
	"CN-3773" `	You also meet with Marco Bugati, the Syndicate executive who oversaw the installation of your jump drives, and tell him that you may soon be able to reopen one of the connections to Republic space, as well. You ask if he can send a courier ship to Earth to inform them of the new situation, to have them begin massing a fleet there. He agrees. He also tells you that a few of the Syndicate ships that met you in orbit have been designated as additions to your attack fleet, so they will be traveling back to Maker with you if the reflector succeeds in reopening the link.`
	"CN-3774" `	A few hours later, the engineers tell you that they think the link is beginning to reopen. Bugati says, "You should take off and return as soon as possible, in case Maker has been attacked in your absence."`
	"CN-3775" `Freya is overjoyed that she has found a way to reverse the Pug technology and restore a hyperspace connection to human space. "Now we actually have a chance," she says. "Before, with just you and six other ships, victory seemed unlikely."`
	"CN-3776" `Freya is overjoyed that she has found a way to reverse the Pug technology and restore a hyperspace connection to human space. "Now we actually have a chance," she says. "Before, with just you and seven other ships, victory seemed unlikely."`
	"CN-3777" `	"What should we do next?"`
	"CN-3778" `	"Are you sure that generating these graviton waves is safe?"`
	"CN-3779" `	"I'm sure of nothing," she says, "but it seemed to work, and without any catastrophic side effects so far, so that's something."`
	"CN-3780" `	Freya leads you to a warehouse in the spaceport where another one of the "graviton reflectors" is stored. "This should work the same as the one you brought to Hephaestus," she says. "If there's a transmitter on Shiver, we can bring the reflector to Sol and open a link back to the very heart of human space. And at that point, we may even have the Pug outgunned. But first, we need to drive them away from that star system for long enough for me to work the transmitter."`
	"CN-3781" `Sure enough, Freya finds a graviton wave transmitter on <origin>, set up to broadcast incoherent graviton noise in the direction of the Sol system. "This is it," she says. "If you can reach <planet> with the reflector before we are overrun by the Pug here, we can reopen the hyperspace link and the entire Navy will be at our backs. Hopefully the Syndicate got a message through and they'll have a fleet waiting for you when you arrive."`
	"CN-3782" `	"You really think you can hold off the Pug if I make a run for <planet>?"`
	"CN-3783" `	"I'm worried that you won't survive if I leave this system undefended."`
	"CN-3784" `	"Don't worry about us here," she says. "We have a fair number of ships here on the ground, if it comes to that. But the most important thing is that you rendezvous with the Navy reinforcements in the <system> system, and if you can draw the Pug fleet to pursue you, all the better. Good luck, <first>."`
	"CN-3785" `You help some Navy engineers on Earth to set up the graviton reflector according to Freya's instructions. As before, soon after the reflector is operational the ground seems to tilt and roll as Freya's beam homes in on the reflector and sets up a harmonic oscillation between the two. "The link is reopening!" says one of the engineers. "We're beginning to receive hyperspace communications from Altair again, and from the Syndicate too."`
	"CN-3786" `	A second later your own communicator beeps. It's Freya. "Get back here quickly," she says. "Bring whatever reinforcements you can. A massive Pug fleet just appeared in orbit."`
	"CN-3787" `The tiny spaceport on Shiver is packed with people as more and more Navy ships come in for a landing. The Navy admirals have decided that there is no sense in delaying: you will be launching an attack on the Pug homeworld in the morning. Despite your success so far in battling the Pug, you know that if their entire fleet opposes you, even the Navy may not be strong enough to defeat them. This may be the last time you see many of these officers and crew members alive.`
	"CN-3788" `	You find Freya sitting in a secluded nook on the upper floor of the spaceport building, watching the drifting snow out the window. "Ready for the last battle, Captain?" she asks.`
	"CN-3789" `When you and Freya get back to the spaceport, Danforth pulls you aside. "We should talk," he says. He leads you to a private room aboard his ship, and says, "It seems that we've reached the end of whatever game these aliens were playing with us. And that means we need to get back to what we were doing before they interrupted us: bringing the Syndicate to justice."`
	"CN-3790" `	"Sounds good. What's your plan?"`
	"CN-3791" `	"We just fought a major battle, and the Syndicate helped us. Do we really want to be at war with them again?"`
	"CN-3792" `	Danforth sighs. "No, I don't want more war. But I also don't think we can go back to trusting the Syndicate. Especially now that we know they've got nuclear weapons."`
	"CN-3793" `	"What's your plan, then?" asks Freya.`
	"CN-3794" `	"From what I've heard of your conversation with their CEO, Korban," says Danforth, "I think the Syndicate leadership might be willing to surrender these extremists to us. Especially if it helps the leaders to clear their own names. I'm thinking we should stop by the Syndicate headquarters while the rest of their fleet is still occupied here. If just my ship and yours leave, it won't attract too much attention."`
	"CN-3795" `The presence of a Navy Cruiser in orbit seldom goes unnoticed, especially a Cruiser captained by someone as famous as William Danforth. As soon as you land, a Syndicate employee meets you and escorts you, Freya, and Danforth to the office of Alastair Korban, the CEO. He does not seem very happy to see you. "I only just got word that the aliens were defeated a few days ago," he says. "I'm surprised you're back here already."`
	"CN-3796" `	Danforth says, "I've got a whole Navy fleet just a few jumps away from here who are itching to destroy something. So here's the deal. You name me some targets: the men who were responsible for the terrorist attack. Then I will do you a favor and take them off your hands. Fair enough?"`
	"CN-3797" `	Korban sighs, and then opens his desk and pulls out a sheet of paper. "This is my resignation letter," he says. "I've been working on it since my first meeting with Captain <last>. I've failed in my leadership of this company. But you have no idea how deep that failure goes."`
	"CN-3798" `	"Years ago," he says, "some leaders of our financial division were approached by some... consultants. Some very intelligent and knowledgeable individuals. These consultants had built a powerful quantum computer, running a model of the galactic economy. They called it the 'Oracle.' As you may know, business is all about taking risks, for uncertain payoffs. But the Oracle gave us a way to predict the future, for everything from supply chain management to stock trading to the commodities market."`
	"CN-3799" `	"These consultants," says Freya, "were they human?"`
	"CN-3800" `	Alastair looks very uncomfortable. "Yes... and no," he says.`
	"CN-3801" `	Danforth swears. "Alphas. You were dealing with the Alphas. What did you give them in return?"`
	"CN-3802" `	"The Korath raids had just begun," says Alastair, "so we suddenly had access to alien technology. They were interested in all of it, but particularly the jump drives. So they could spread beyond human space."`
	"CN-3803" `	"Was the information from the Oracle accurate?"`
	"CN-3804" `	"Why would you ever agree to work with the Alphas?"`
	"CN-3805" `	"They have power. And knowledge. To some of us, that was enough," he says.`
	"CN-3806" `	"Was that knowledge accurate?" asks Freya.`
	"CN-3807" `	"Very accurate," he says. "Our business flourished like never before. But then a month came when instead, the Oracle's predictions were bleak. A massive recession was coming, an end to the golden days of the Republic. We tried altering the model in every way we could: changing our production, our wages. We even asked the Oracle if dissolving the Syndicate would avert the recession. But its predictions remained the same. Then we learned from our contacts in Parliament about the Southern Defense Pact, and the fear that they were about to declare independence. So we asked the Oracle what would happen if war broke out."`
	"CN-3808" `	"You started a war... to save the economy?" says Danforth. He sounds disgusted. "Do you know how many lives have been lost because of your sick greed?"`
	"CN-3809" `	Alastair snaps at Danforth. "Do you think we made this decision lightly? Do you know how many lives would have been lost had such a recession actually occurred? The last time the economy fell as hard as the Oracle predicted, humanity entered a dark age where millions died of starvation and billions more suffered from the resulting chaos!`
	"CN-3810" `	"But... the Alphas were only too glad to help. Especially with the nuclear research. Which, incidentally, is why I'm telling you all this, because if your fleet tries to take out the Alphas, they'll strike back with nukes."`
	"CN-3811" `	"Do you have an alternative to attacking them?"`
	"CN-3812" `	"Is there any way we could disable the nukes?"`
	"CN-3813" `	"We gave the Alphas most of the alien technology we recovered," he says, "but one device, we managed to keep secret from them. We found it in a Korath cargo hold, and it took us a long time to even figure out how to activate it. But when we did, we discovered that it's a cloaking device. It obscures a ship not just from the visible spectrum, but from radar as well, and every other sensor we've tested except for gravitational ones. I'm certain it would hide you from the tracking systems on the nukes."`
	"CN-3814" `	Freya says, "But it would only hide one ship. That doesn't sound like it would do much good."`
	"CN-3815" `	Alastair says, "They have a limited number of nukes. Our plan was to send a ship in cloaked, have it uncloak long enough to draw their fire, and then cloak to avoid the missiles. Basically, see how many missiles we can get them to spend before the main attack fleet arrives."`
	"CN-3816" `	Danforth says, "That's not a bad idea. Captain <last>, would you be willing to serve as the decoy?"`
	"CN-3817" `	"It sounds risky, but I'll do it."`
	"CN-3818" `	"Do I get to keep the cloaking device when I'm done?"`
	"CN-3819" `	"I don't see why not," says Danforth, fixing Alastair with a piercing gaze. "It's certainly better than leaving it in Syndicate hands."`
	"CN-3820" `	Alastair tells you that the device is being kept on Hephaestus, and the engineers there can install it in your ship. Meanwhile, Danforth will call in the rest of his Oathkeeper fleet. "And when we're through with this, I'll be seeing to it that this Oracle is destroyed so that this can never happen again," says Danforth. Alastair gives a meek nod in agreement. "Now, where are the Alphas?"`
	"CN-3821" `	"The Alphas are holed up on Buccaneer Bay," says Alastair, "an old pirate world. Good luck in defeating them."`
	"CN-3822" `You land in the same private hangar that you visited previously to have the jump drive installed, and you think these engineers are the same crew that met you back then. "This thing is almost as bizarre as the jump drive itself," one of them says. "We have no clue how it works, and we weren't done studying it when Korban ordered us to give it to you, so please don't get yourself blown up. Okay?"`
	"CN-3823" `	Meanwhile, Danforth is on his way back to Deneb to rally the Oathkeepers. You should head directly for the <system> system, so that you arrive there far enough in advance of the Oathkeeper fleet.`
	"CN-3824" `Soon after you land, more Navy ships begin pouring into the system, including Admiral Danforth's own Cruiser. Navy soldiers and ships are scouring the whole surface of the planet; there is very little chance that any of the Alphas who remain here will be able to escape their detection. Admiral Danforth meets with you and Freya and thanks you for providing the decoy that kept his own ships from bearing the brunt of the Alphas' nuclear arsenal.`
	"CN-3825" `	"Do you need us to do anything more here?" asks Freya.`
	"CN-3826" `	"No," he says, "and I hear that Parliament wants to speak with you, Captain <last>. Something about an official commendation for your part in the battle against the Pug, I think. Meanwhile, this may not be the end of our trouble with the Syndicate, but at least it's a good start. It's been an honor to fight alongside you."`
	"CN-3827" `	"You too, sir."`
	"CN-3828" `	"You mean this is the end? No more battles to fight?"`
	"CN-3829" `	"What, does peace and reconciliation sound boring to you?" he says. "Don't worry about that. With that jump drive installed in your ship, the whole galaxy is open to you. Who knows what you might discover beyond the boundaries of human space?"`
	"CN-3830" `	You return to your ship, and prepare for the journey back to Earth, hopeful that at last Parliament will be willing to negotiate a permanent peace with the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-3831" `On Earth, you return to something of a hero's welcome, far different from the first time you were here on a diplomatic mission. A crowd of locals gathers in the spaceport to watch your ship land. With the Free Worlds having been instrumental in defeating the aliens, and absolved of any guilt in the terrorist attacks, it seems that most people here are ready to see you as a hero rather than a criminal.`
	"CN-3832" `	Your meeting with Parliament is long and grueling, as they press you and Freya for every detail you can give them about the enigmatic Pug and their apparent motivation in invading human space. The questions about the Syndicate are equally hard to answer. But at the end of the session, one of the members of Parliament informs you that they have authorized an official commendation for you, along with a reward of five million credits "to cover any of your expenses from fighting the aliens."`
	"CN-3833" `	As you walk out, you find Alondo, JJ, and Katya sitting in the courtyard of Parliament. When they spot you walking towards them, JJ waves and says, "<first> and Freya! Am I glad to see the two of you still in one piece! What brings you to Earth?"`
	"CN-3834" `	"I received a commendation from Parliament."`
	"CN-3835" `	"Parliament wanted to interrogate us on what happened with the Pug and the Syndicate."`
	"CN-3836" `	"We just needed to deal with some boring administrative stuff."`
	"CN-3837" `	"And I'm sure that it was very well deserved," says Katya with a smirk.`
	"CN-3838" `	"I hope that they were nicer questioning you than they were to me," Katya says with a grin.`
	"CN-3839" `	"Well," Katya says while smirking, "You'll be glad to know that you aren't alone in grappling with the bureaucracy."`
	"CN-3840" `	"What have you three been doing?" Freya asks.`
	"CN-3841" `	Alondo says, "We've been talking to Parliament, and they're finally beginning to let off of us. They have signed a treaty with the Free Worlds, agreeing that the Navy will begin pulling out of any occupied systems, and that the Free Worlds will be allowed autonomy in the region they currently control as long as they do not seek to expand their territory further. As of now, our war against the Republic is officially over."`
	"CN-3842" `	Alondo says, "We've been talking to Parliament, and they're finally beginning to let off of us. They have signed a treaty with the Free Worlds, agreeing that the Free Worlds will be allowed autonomy in the region they currently control as long as they do not seek to expand their territory further. As of now, our war against the Republic is officially over."`
	"CN-3843" `	"What about you two?" says JJ. "How did fighting the Pug go?"`
	"CN-3844" `	You and Freya explain to the rest of the Council how the Pug were defeated, as well as the truth behind the Syndicate starting the war. When you finish, Katya says, "Vanishing aliens, prophetic supercomputers starting wars, Alphas pulling strings in the Syndicate's ranks; if I hadn't seen events just as unbelievable over the last few months, I would write what you're saying off as a bad conspiracy theory."`
	"CN-3845" `	"Well, it looks like the Council is all together again," says JJ, "for the last time, as it so happens. Now that the war has ended, and the Pug have been defeated, the Senate has voted to dissolve the Council, leaving us free to return to civilian life. However, they've also agreed to pay you, <first>, a reduced salary in gratitude of your service. So, what do you think you will do next?"`
	"CN-3846" `	"Well, we all wish you the best of luck," says Freya. "We would never have gotten this far without you. Be sure to stay in touch." You hug each of them goodbye, and return to your ship. What you do next is up to you...`
	"CN-3847" `You are on <origin>, home to the Free Worlds Conservatory where Ijs is on faculty as a professor. Would you like to visit him and see how he is doing?`
	"CN-3848" `	(Not right now.)`
	"CN-3849" `	While looking Ijs up in the campus directory, you notice something else: Katya is listed in the directory too, as "Visiting Professor of Civics and Economics." You give Ijs a call and ask if he and Katya would like to meet up with you for dinner, and they readily agree.`
	"CN-3850" `	When you join them at the restaurant, Katya says, "It's really great to see you again, <first>."`
	"CN-3851" `	"Not to mention," says Ijs, "it's great to have an excuse to eat somewhere other than the student center for once. How has life been treating you, <first>?"`
	"CN-3852" `	"I miss the excitement of the work we did together, but other than that life is great."`
	"CN-3853" `	"It's kind of hard to adjust to civilian life."`
	"CN-3854" `	"I want to explore the rest of the galaxy, but apparently that part of the game hasn't been fully implemented yet."`
	"CN-3855" `	"I understand that feeling," says Katya. "But, just remind yourself, this is what we fought for. For peace. For a world where no one has to fear for their lives."`
	"CN-3856" `	"Tell me about it," laughs Katya. "I can hardly believe I'm now a professor. Or at least, acting as one. But after so much fighting, and so much time alone and imprisoned, for me it feels good to finally be able to relax, to let go of the idea that the galaxy will fall apart without me."`
	"CN-3857" `	"Whoops," says Ijs, "now you've done it, there goes the fourth wall."`
	"CN-3858" `	Katya laughs. "Well, there's already lots beyond human space to see, and I'm sure you can find more things to do out there as well as closer to home. If you're so eager to explore more of the galaxy, <first>, or to discover what new adventures it has to offer, maybe you should volunteer to help out with creating the stories to populate it. This is an open source game after all, and it relies on people like you to bring it to life."`
	"CN-3859" `	Your dinner arrives, and you spend a pleasant evening eating together and reminiscing about old times. Back in the days of the civil war, neither Katya nor Ijs were people who smiled or laughed easily. Now, however, they have an entirely different air about them, peaceful and contented. It's heartening to see that they, at least, have found a happy ending together after all the chaos you lived through.`
	"CN-3860" `	Suddenly you realize that around you, the restaurant workers are sweeping the floors and putting chairs up on tables: it's closing time, and you are the last ones there. "Well <first>," says Ijs, "it was good of you to stop by, and I wish you the best in your journeys among the stars. Give our regards to the others if you see them." You wish them well, and return to your ship.`
	"CN-3861" `As you're coming in for a landing on Bourne, you receive a message from Alondo. "<first>!" he says. "I just heard that you were in system. Want to meet up for a drink and talk about old times?"`
	"CN-3862" `	"Sorry, I'm busy right now."`
	"CN-3863" `	You meet up with Alondo at a local pub. He tells you that his life has continued to be quite full since the war ended and the Council was dissolved: he's been placed in charge of the Free Worlds diplomatic corps, whose main job appears to be to make sure all the individual planets feel like their concerns are being listened to. "It means lots of travel," he says, "and lots of fine meals with important people. And they're always interested to hear my stories from the war times."`
	"CN-3864" `	You tell Alondo a bit about what you've been doing since the war ended. "Of course," he says, "you're traveling the galaxy. I knew from the start you weren't the kind who would quickly put down roots on a single planet."`
	"CN-3865" `	Alondo goes on to describe some of the inner workings of the Free Worlds Senate, and the mutual defense arrangement that forms the backbone of the government. "For a while there," he says, "it felt like there was so much bureaucracy that we couldn't get anything done, but now it's finally starting to function in the way all of us imagined. Quite an honor to have had a hand in the birth of a new government."`
	"CN-3866" `	"Spoken like a true bureaucrat."`
	"CN-3867" `	"I really do hope the Free Worlds can live up to our original vision of justice and equality."`
	"CN-3868" `	"Fair enough," he says, "but I really do believe we've created a government here that is less prone to the inequalities that they're still struggling with in the Republic."`
	"CN-3869" `	"Me too," he says. "We've got a good start, but then again, so did the Republic, back in the day."`
	"CN-3870" `	He is quiet for a moment, and then says, "I guess that's why I'm still here in the thick of things, instead of just settling down somewhere and leaving public life behind. I don't believe society or government just naturally becomes good or stays good without effort. So I'm here to speak up when we start to stray from our original vision."`
	"CN-3871" `	You sit and talk with each other for quite a while longer, reminiscing about old times. Then, you wish him well in his work, and he tells you to stop by and say hello any time you're in the area. You head back to your ship.`
	"CN-3872" `When you land on <origin>, you head into the city to explore a bit and to find out if the Navy and the others who have come here after them have had any luck in unlocking the secrets of this place. Already, it appears that some of the empty apartments have become actual living quarters for people, and there are even a handful of shops opening up on the main street.`
	"CN-3873" `	In one of those shops, you run into Freya. "<first>!" she says. "It's good to see you again. I hear that Parliament named you an official war hero or something. Much better than being a wanted fugitive, huh?"`
	"CN-3874" `	"Yes, it's quite an honor."`
	"CN-3875" `	"Yes, it's hard to know what to do with myself now that no one wants to kill me."`
	"CN-3876" `	"Right. Just remember, none of it would have happened without me, okay? Not that I have any desire to be a hero; that sort of public attention would be pretty much my worst nightmare."`
	"CN-3877" `	"Well, I'm sure you can find something interesting to do," she says. "Go fight some pirates. Or become a business mogul and get filthy rich. Whatever floats your boat."`
	"CN-3878" `	"What have you found out about the Pug?" you ask.`
	"CN-3879" `	"Not much," she says. "The wormhole doesn't seem to lead to their real home; it's just another red herring. The real breakthrough, of course, would be if we could find some hints in the stuff they left behind about how to build more jump drives of our own. But so far, we can't even figure out how to create new hyperspace links where there wasn't one originally. I'm starting to think that those graviton transmitters we used were just one more game - a toy, not the real thing. Not what created the links in the first place, I mean, unless they were created by someone with the patience to wait a million years for them to work."`
	"CN-3880" `	"Have you found any other interesting technology?"`
	"CN-3881" `	"Any more hints about who the Pug were and what they wanted?"`
	"CN-3882" `	"Some," she says. "Everything they left behind is like, well... an educational toy. Like some absent parent left behind a super-advanced chemistry set for their kids to play with. That's how all the artifacts we find here feel - not like the real thing that the Pug would have used, but like a simplified model that they gave us to help us figure it out. Everything they left behind, I'm convinced they left intentionally, because it could teach us something they wanted us to know, while keeping all their true secrets secret. The rest of you moved on, and I'm still here playing their game."`
	"CN-3883" `	"Not much," she says. "This world - it feels like when you're visiting a friend's house, and they spent the whole day cleaning up for you. It's not like a person's home is when you drop by unannounced. Nothing's out of place. Everything that's lying out somewhere, is something they wanted you to see. There's some weird technology they left behind, but all of it is like toys, puzzles... I don't know, like an educational game they designed for us to play. The rest of you moved on, and I'm still here playing their game."`
	"CN-3884" `	"You sound frustrated."`
	"CN-3885" `	"You know, the war is over, you can relax if you want to."`
	"CN-3886" `	"I know, I know," she says. "I complain, but really there's nowhere else I would rather be. Even if everything we're discovering here is nothing more than what they intended for us to discover, it's still the most interesting work I could possibly be doing right now. So, don't feel sorry for me. Really."`
	"CN-3887" `	You talk for a while longer, and she tells you she'll be sure to be in touch if they ever get to the root of the Pug's motivation. "Until then," she says, "good luck in your travels. I hope the galaxy never runs out of ways to surprise you."`
	"CN-3888" `	"By the way, can I ask you something, <first>? About you? Sorry if this is rather abrupt. I've been too busy to talk during the war."`
	"CN-3889" `	"Sure. What is it?"`
	"CN-3890" `	"Sorry, I'd prefer if you didn't."`
	"CN-3891" `	"Do you happen to know anyone named Lavinia? Married to someone named Marcus?"`
	"CN-3892" `	Both names sound oddly familiar, but you can't remember where you heard them.`
	"CN-3893" `	"I think so, but I need a minute to remember exactly who."`
	"CN-3894" `	"No, I don't."`
	"CN-3895" `	"Oh, okay. I think I've been mistaken, then. Never mind."`
	"CN-3896" `	You try to recall exactly where you've heard those names before, racking your brain for any information on these vaguely familiar names, then all of a sudden, it hits you. Marcus and Lavinia were two of your great-grandparents. You wonder why someone you've never met until around the time you joined the Free Worlds is suddenly asking about your ancestors. Maybe she was thinking of a different Marcus and Lavinia.`
	"CN-3897" `	"Yeah, I do know a Marcus and Lavinia, but they're my great-grandparents. Are you sure you're asking the right person?" you ask.`
	"CN-3898" `	"Oh my God," Freya says. "I can't believe it."`
	"CN-3899" `	"I think we're related. Second cousins. Marcus and Lavinia Winters are also my great-grandparents."`
	"CN-3900" `	"Really?"`
	"CN-3901" `	"Well, then, hello, cousin. Nice to meet you."`
	"CN-3902" `	"Yeah, I can hardly believe it myself. I think it's nice, though. A pleasant surprise." You agree.`
	"CN-3903" `	"Heh. Nice to meet you, too. Looks like we brought some prestige to the Winters family name, haven't we, cousin?"`
	"CN-3904" `	You both laugh at her reply.`
	"CN-3905" `	"Never thought I'd go about saving the galaxy with a second cousin I'd never met," she continues, "but in a war where some previously-unknown hyperlane-manipulating aliens intervene to try and make both sides unite, I guess anything's possible."`
	"CN-3906" `Would you like to stop by and see how Admiral Danforth is doing?`
	"CN-3907" `	Danforth is quite excited to see you. "Captain <last>!" he says. "So good to see you back up here in my neck of the woods again. It's funny, you'd think that with the war over they'd just dissolve the Oathkeepers, since the whole Republic is at peace with the Free Worlds and there's no longer any oath left for us to keep. But, the Oathkeepers became so well known for our role against the Pug and the Syndicate that now everyone wants to join our division."`
	"CN-3908" `	Danforth is quite excited to see you. "Captain <last>!" he says. "So good to see you back up here in my neck of the woods again. It's funny, you'd think that with the war over they'd just dissolve the Oathkeepers, since the whole Republic is at peace with the Free Worlds and there's no longer any oath left for us to keep. But, the Oathkeepers became so well known for our role against the Pug that now everyone wants to join our division."`
	"CN-3909" `	"Glad to see you're still in the thick of things, sir!"`
	"CN-3910" `	"What sort of work is the Navy doing now that we're at peace?"`
	"CN-3911" `	"Oh, you bet I am," he says. "I'll never retire from the Navy, you know. I plan to still be serving on the day I die."`
	"CN-3912" `	"Just the sort of work we all signed up for in the first place," he says. "Defending the defenseless, keeping the peace, helping silly novice pilots who run out of fuel."`
	"CN-3913" `	"Are the pirates giving you any trouble?" you ask.`
	"CN-3914" `	"A bit," he says. "We still have far too many pirates in this sector, in part due to the Free Worlds mostly driving them out of the South. The pirates grew stronger and more bold as the war dragged on, when all our fleets were busy elsewhere, but now we're beginning to get them under control again."`
	"CN-3915" `	Then he leans forward and says, more quietly, "Of course, you and I both know the pirates aren't the main threat. Raven is off infiltrating Syndicate worlds even as we speak, and several of my other best intelligence officers, too. The Syndicate wants us to believe that they've weeded out all the rotten apples from their ranks, but we're keeping an eye on them, all the same."`
	"CN-3916" `	Then he leans forward and says, more quietly, "Just a heads-up that the Navy has their eye on the Free Worlds still. Just because a peace treaty was made doesn't mean you can keep your nukes forever."`
	"CN-3917" `	After you talk for a while longer, Danforth wishes you luck and sends you on your way. "I'll be in touch if we ever need your assistance in the future," he says.`
	"CN-3918" `As you complete your landing procedure, you recall having come here to assist in some testing for new weapons, back in the thick of the war. Do you want to check in on Barmy Edward, the lead engineer?`
	"CN-3919" `	(No.)`
	"CN-3920" `	You give your name to the receptionist, and she directs you to a hangar where you find Barmy Edward, who is working on a weapon that looks like a modified Plasma Cannon. When he notices you, he gets up from his work and shakes your hand warmly. "Ah, <last>. It's been too long! How fortunate for me! I'm actually just putting the finishing touches on a new prototype. You wouldn't be too busy to assist me in some practical testing, would you?"`
	"CN-3921" `	"I'm not sure about this. What would you have me do?"`
	"CN-3922" `	"Being a target for experimental weapons? Just tell me what you need!"`
	"CN-3923" `	"Not much out of the ordinary from our tests in the past," he replies. "You'll find a ship of ours in orbit that goes by <npc>. It's been fitted with a few of these new weapons. Your job will be to fight and disable it, tell us what you think of its combat capabilities, and transfer your ship's logs so we can analyze the fight."`
	"CN-3924" `	"Alright, I suppose for old times' sake I can help out."`
	"CN-3925" `	"Sorry, I just wanted to check in and see how you were doing."`
	"CN-3926" `	He turns to you and smirks. "We've recommissioned the ship from retirement, so it's not top of the line, but try to keep it in one piece for future use. Understand?"`
	"CN-3927" `	"Of course! I'll take care of it."`
	"CN-3928" `	"Great," he says, rubbing his hands together with a gleeful expression on his face. He's clearly looking forward to hearing what you think of his latest invention.`
	"CN-3929" `	"I see. Well, I'm sure we can find someone else up to the task. Regardless, Captain <last>, I assure you this new weapon vastly improves on the outdated Plasma Cannon. This'll put Kraz Cybernetics in the big leagues!"`
	"CN-3930" `	"How about we get out of here, <first>? My work is done for today, and I know a homely little bar that's only a short walk."`
	"CN-3931" `	"Of course. It's not like there's a war to worry about anymore."`
	"CN-3932" `	"Ha! Well, of course, the war kept all of us plenty busy." He leads you out of the facility while telling an anecdote that must be humor for an engineer.`
	"CN-3933" `You head to the hangar to meet up with Barmy Edward, and find him tinkering with the modified Plasma Cannon you saw when you first entered. "It runs much hotter, you see," he explains. "But the results are impressive."`
	"CN-3934" `	"Was that a plasma cannon? Or something else?"`
	"CN-3935" `	"It's not winning any damage records, that's for sure."`
	"CN-3936" `	"Heh, it's been a while since we've seen a good upgrade to the cannon," he says. "That was the Plasma Repeater. Of course, it wasn't easy to make a better iteration of something that countless fools have failed to improve on."`
	"CN-3937" `	"When will it be available for sale?" you ask.`
	"CN-3938" `	"Well, you are one of the revered captains that drove off the Pug," he says. "The idea is that by shrinking the bolts of superheated plasma, we can offload many more bursts onto a target. The effects on said target result in faster buildup of heat and, of course, damage. Big ships will usually ward off these effects much longer than a smaller ship would, but that's always been a notable issue with the original design. Besides, the repeater is a hell of a lot more impressive."`
	"CN-3939" `	"That's a unique direction," you reply. "Are they available for sale yet?"`
	"CN-3940" `	"Thanks to you, it should be in stock in a few months," he answers. "I'm sure you're past the point where our weapons are useful, but then again, not everybody has a jump drive." He grins. "How about we celebrate with some drinks? I know a quaint little bar not far from here."`
	"CN-3941" `	"I have time; let's celebrate!"`
	"CN-3942" `	"I'll pass on that, but it was good checking in on you."`
	"CN-3943" `	You follow Barmy into the bar. Even with the smear of grease still on his face, he fits in with the crowd. You both stand at the bar and order your drinks. Barmy's order catches you off guard, and he notices your expression. "What? A man who works with his hands can't enjoy a drink with some age?" You chuckle, and you both tell stories of your early lives. He tells how he had some exciting adventures in his youth among the stars, but found his passion tinkering and finding ways to improve on outdated equipment.`
	"CN-3944" `	He's shocked to discover your origins on New Boston. "You're really from that backwater planet? I'm surprised you were able to escape the racket they have going on there. I was lucky to get out myself!"`
	"CN-3945" `	"Wait, you're from New Boston too?"`
	"CN-3946" `	"It wasn't perfect there, but at least it wasn't quite so noisy down on the ground."`
	"CN-3947" `	"Nothing like it is now. I've got the whole universe ahead of me!"`
	"CN-3948" `	"You wouldn't think to have met someone from your very own birth planet, eh?" He chuckles. "Small galaxy, I suppose."`
	"CN-3949" `	You both have a great time hearing of each other's early lives, but you eventually wrap up your visit after a long night of bouncing stories back and forth. You say your goodbyes and head back to your ship.`
	"CN-3950" `While returning from a walk around the spaceport of <origin>, you see the quartermaster of the spaceport inspecting your ship. He notices your arrival and comes up to greet you.`
	"CN-3951" `	"You're Captain <first> <last>, yes? We're looking for a good ship that can escort these freighters to <planet>." He points towards five Syndicate Freighters in Free Worlds colors on the landing pads opposite to your ship, some of which have considerable hull damage and are actively being repaired.`
	"CN-3952" `	"Their last escort was just taken out by pirates, and we need someone who is experienced enough to fend off or evade them. You must have a reputation, since some of our militia captains recognized you. This is for quite a significant project on <planet>, so you will be paid <payment>."`
	"CN-3953" `	"What is the project? It seems to be a big enterprise."`
	"CN-3954" `	"That's a fair few freighters. Should I be expecting any more pirates?"`
	"CN-3955" `	"Sorry, I'm not planning on going that way."`
	"CN-3956" `	"The freighters are carrying construction materials and specialized shipbuilding equipment for a planned extension to Zug's New Port, which has been a long time coming. It would greatly help the Free Worlds' efforts. I suppose that is why there have been pirates trying to pounce on these ships; the equipment would be a rich prize for them."`
	"CN-3957" `	"Yes, I would expect more pirate contact, because the movement of so many freighters would be a tempting target for them, and moreover, they are carrying valuable equipment for warship manufacturing. I'd certainly recommend avoiding combat when possible. In these trying times, the loss of these ships would be... not ideal."`
	"CN-3958" `	"Well, will you help us escort these freighters?"`
	"CN-3959" `	"Of course, I'll get these freighters to <planet> safely."`
	"CN-3960" `	"No, I won't be able to, sorry."`
	"CN-3961" `	"Wonderful! I expect that these ships will benefit the Free Worlds immensely." With that, he leaves you to meet with the captains of the freighters.`
	"CN-3962" `The five freighters have all arrived intact, and you are told to land them beside a large area of land set aside for Zug's long-awaited New Port expansion. Not long after, you are sent <payment> by Zug's port authority.`
	"CN-3963" `	It seems that bringing so many freighters was justified, because the expansion also includes a considerable extension to Southbound's shipbuilding facilities to make them capable of building heavy warships like Tarazed Falcons. However, by the looks of it, all this equipment would be more than enough to build a Navy Cruiser.`
	"CN-3964" `As you land on <planet>, you recall that the monks who live here are involved in some sort of outreach to children serving as pirate crew members. They might have something to say about the best way to deal with the pirate threat. Do you want to visit them?`
	"CN-3965" `	It's a short walk to the monastery from the spaceport. When you arrive there, you run into a monk who is working in the garden. He glances up, and recognizes you. "Welcome back," he says. "You're Katya's friend, right? I'm David. I've forgotten your name."`
	"CN-3966" `	"<first>," you say.`
	"CN-3967" `	He brushes some of the dirt off his hands and then shakes hands with you. "How are you doing?" he asks. "And how is Katya? And Ijs?" You explain to him that you are now an official member of the Free Worlds, and that Katya has been captured by the Republic. He is clearly shocked and saddened by the news. After pressing you for all the details, he asks, "And what about you? What brings you to Harmony?"`
	"CN-3968" `	"The Free Worlds are hoping to eliminate piracy in this sector, and I was hoping for advice on what targets we should attack."`
	"CN-3969" `	"The Free Worlds are thinking of launching an attack on the pirates, but I've been thinking about what Brother Greg said about the pirate crews being just kids."`
	"CN-3970" `	"If you want some military advice," he says, "here's what I can tell you. You cannot create peace using violence. Most people on the pirate worlds are not pirates, just ordinary people unlucky enough to be born there. Or people who feel unwelcome everywhere else."`
	"CN-3971" `	"It's true," he says. "If you fight the pirates, innocent lives will be lost."`
	"CN-3972" `	"Then what do you suggest we do?" you ask.`
	"CN-3973" `	"Well," he says, "it's worth repeating that most people on the 'pirate' worlds are not pirates. They're just anarchists. As a monk, I feel a sort of kinship with them."`
	"CN-3974" `	"How so?"`
	"CN-3975" `	"Naturally."`
	"CN-3976" `	"For starters, we both wear black all the time," he says, grinning. "And more to the point, we're both seeking to build an alternative community according to our own ideals. Historically, monasticism can actually be seen as a form of utopic anarchism - 'Fear none but God' and all that."`
	"CN-3977" `	"That makes absolutely no sense. Are you joking around with me?"`
	"CN-3978" `	He grins. "Well, that's a tangent, anyway. My real advice is this: figure out what the people on those pirate worlds want, and how to offer it to them. Freedom from government intervention would be a good start. But that means no annexing their territory for the Free Worlds. Instead, you could offer them some sort of pact: they stop supporting pirate fleets, and you agree to leave their planets in peace."`
	"CN-3979" `	"Thanks for the advice. I'll see if we can work out something like that."`
	"CN-3980" `	"No way. We need to speak the language they understand. Overwhelming force."`
	"CN-3981" `	He wishes you the best of luck, and you return to the port.`
	"CN-3982" `	"It won't end," he says, "not unless you exterminate every last person on those planets. But I can't control what choices you make. Good luck." He returns to gardening, and you walk back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-3983" `When you meet Ijs in the spaceport, he has Lynn and Henry Anderson with him, the friends of Katya who you transported from Glory back before you joined the Free Worlds. Ijs is beaming - his meeting must have gone really well. "Guess what, Captain?" he says. "We've got a location for the Conservatory! The government of Winter has offered a community center for our use."`
	"CN-3984" `When you meet Ijs in the spaceport, he has a man and a woman with him which he introduces as Lynn and Henry Anderson, a top planetary scientist and ex-Navy intel officer who defected from the Republic shortly after the Free Worlds were formed. Ijs is beaming - his meeting must have gone really well. "Guess what, Captain?" he says. "We've got a location for the Conservatory! The government of Winter has offered a community center for our use."`
	"CN-3985" `	"A somewhat run-down community center," adds Henry.`
	"CN-3986" `	Ijs laughs. "True. Anyway, we were hoping you could give us a lift over there, and maybe help out with securing some equipment, too."`
	"CN-3987" `	"Sure, I'd definitely like to help make this a reality!"`
	"CN-3988" `	"Sorry, I've got more important business to attend to."`
	"CN-3989" `	Ijs seems really dejected. "Are you sure?" he asks. "This could make a big difference for the Free Worlds, as much as any military victory. We could just tag along with whatever 'more important business' you have until it's convenient for you to drop us off."`
	"CN-3990" `	"Okay, I'll help you."`
	"CN-3991" `	"Sorry, I'm just not interested."`
	"CN-3992" `In the spaceport, it does not take long to locate Ijs; he is supervising a crew that is loading trade goods onto several Free Worlds ships. "Glad to see you, <first>," he says. "These three ships need to get to Tarazed and back without being destroyed by pirates... or by the Republic. They'll be bringing back a selection of terraforming equipment supplied from Tarazed and, if you can believe it, the Syndicate as well! I'm pretty sure they know I'm involved in this, so I wonder if this is just a ploy to keep me out of their hair after the war is over, but I won't be complaining about the help.`
	"CN-3993" `	"Think you can tag along and protect the freighters?"`
	"CN-3994" `	"Sure thing!"`
	"CN-3995" `	"I've got another pressing mission. Can I come back and do this later?"`
	"CN-3996" `	"Sure," he says. "But the longer we wait, the longer it will be until the Conservatory is up and running, so come back soon."`
	"CN-3997" `It looks like Ijs is still in need of an escort for the freighters to bring equipment for the Conservatory from <planet> to <origin>. Do you offer to help?`
	"CN-3998" `	(No, still busy.)`
	"CN-3999" `	You contact Ijs and tell him that you're ready to escort the ships. He shows you the freighters, a collection of three Argosies, and wishes you luck on your journey.`
	"CN-4000" `Ijs meets your convoy as it lands, and checks off each item on a clipboard as it is unloaded. Lynn is with him, looking over the various machines to make sure they are all in working order. "I hope you didn't have any trouble," says Ijs, as he hands you your payment of <payment>.`
	"CN-4001" `	"No, none at all."`
	"CN-4002" `	"A few pirates, nothing I couldn't handle."`
	"CN-4003" `	"Actually, we were lucky to make it back alive."`
	"CN-4004" `	"That's too bad," he says. "This war must be making the Dirt Belt even more unstable than usual. Hopefully we'll be able to do something about that soon."`
	"CN-4005" `	"Is there anything else you need me to do?" you ask.`
	"CN-4006" `	"Not at the moment," he says. "I'll send you a message when we do. Thanks for your help, and if you hear any more news about Katya, please let me know."`
	"CN-4007" `As you disembark, you hear the sounds of warning sirens and heavy machinery coming from the edge of <planet>'s spaceport. It doesn't take long to find the source of the noise: several large construction vehicles are paving a large clearing at the edge of a cliff. At its center are nine large walls covered in letters, with spaces reserved for an additional fourteen walls. The largest wall is emblazoned with the text "Free Worlds War Memorial." Already, there are friends and family paying their respects to the ever-growing number of fallen.`
	"CN-4008" `	As you inspect the walls, you recognize one of the names:`
	"CN-4009" `		MSGT IRENE BROWER`
	"CN-4010" `			KILLED AT THE ATTACK ON GREENROCK`
	"CN-4011" `	The sound of construction persists as you return to the main spaceport.`
	"CN-4012" `A message arrives for you soon after you land. It's from Barmy Edward, the weapons engineer at Kraz Cybernetics. He writes: "Hello again, Captain! I've been working on a new weapon, and for some reason no one else wants to help out with the testing. If you're interested in getting your hands on some hot new technology, drop by Rust and come visit our factory."`
	"CN-4013" `You received a message recently from Barmy Edward, asking you to stop by the Kraz Cybernetics facility to help test a new weapon. Do you want to visit them now?`
	"CN-4014" `	You give your name to the receptionist, and she directs you to the hangar where the weapons group does their design and prototyping. Barmy Edward shakes your hand warmly and says, "Here's the deal. We've got a new weapon, something a little out of the ordinary. We're hoping it will be useful against the pirates, in particular. Interested in helping us?"`
	"CN-4015" `	"Of course," you say.`
	"CN-4016" `	"Great," he says. "I won't share the details, because I want you to get the full effect of the surprise. But, there's a ship in orbit, the Doombat, that has been fitted with a few of these new weapons. Your job will be to fight it and disable it, then tell us what you think of its weapons."`
	"CN-4017" `	He shakes a finger in your face and says, "Now mind you, we just want you to disable the Doombat, not destroy it. We bought it from a scrapyard, so it's barely spaceworthy, but all the same I want to be able to keep using it for future tests. Understood?"`
	"CN-4018" `	"Okay, I promise not to destroy it or steal it."`
	"CN-4019" `	"Sorry, this sounds a bit too risky. I'd rather not be involved in this sort of testing."`
	"CN-4020" `You head to the hangar to meet up with Barmy Edward, and find him tinkering with a large gun you don't recognize. Presumably, this is the Flamethrower that you were just attacked with in orbit. "It runs on hyperspace fuel, you see," he says. "So, what did you think?"`
	"CN-4021" `	"It's a terrifying weapon."`
	"CN-4022" `	"It looks impressive, but it didn't do very much damage."`
	"CN-4023" `	"Your flamethrower doesn't seem to work very well."`
	"CN-4024" `	"Isn't it?" he says. "Mostly useful against small ships, of course, or ships that are running way too close to their thermal thresholds. Need to be almost on top of your target to get the full effect, too. But the ability to temporarily disable a ship without even dropping its shields first could be quite useful in certain tactical situations."`
	"CN-4025" `	"No, doing damage isn't the point," he says. "The idea is to heat up the target to the point where it goes into emergency thermal shutdown. Basically a way to temporarily disable even a ship with full shields. Of course, big ships can absorb an awful lot of heat without changing temperature much, so I suspect it will be most useful against smaller targets. You've got to get right up close to them to get the full heating effect, which isn't going to be easy if you're dealing with larger warships like the Navy ones."`
	"CN-4026" `	"That is an interesting idea," you say. "Are they available for sale yet?"`
	"CN-4027" `	"Oh." He seems somewhat dejected. "Well, if you were flying a smaller ship, you might think differently. Or if your ship didn't have adequate cooling. Or maybe the Doombat didn't get close enough to give you the full power of it. My idea was to target pirate ships with those illegal Modified Blasters that run hotter than usual."`
	"CN-4028" `	"I guess that makes sense," you say, "although I wouldn't want to run out of jump fuel by accident. Are you going to be making them available for sale?"`
	"CN-4029" `	"Well, I should have an initial model for sale in a month or so," he says. "I'll be interested to see what uses you or anyone else might find for them. Anyway, thanks for your help." You say goodbye and head back to your ship.`
	"CN-4030" `When you stop by the spaceport bar, a militia officer who you don't recognize gestures for you to join him. "Captain <last>!" he says. "I'd be honored if you'd let me buy you a drink."`
	"CN-4031" `	"Thank you!"`
	"CN-4032" `	"Sorry, I don't drink."`
	"CN-4033" `	"Then what are you doing in a bar?" he asks. "Never mind, don't answer that. I assume you're here looking for valuable work to do, and if that's the case, I could really use your help."`
	"CN-4034" `	He buys you a drink, and you sit down at his table. After making small talk for a few minutes, he says, "By the way, I could really use your help with a mission for the Free Worlds."`
	"CN-4035" `	"Okay," you say, "tell me more."`
	"CN-4036" `	He says, "You probably know that we have a network of Free Worlds sympathizers throughout much of Republic space. One of our contacts recently sent us word of a new technology that is for sale in the Deep, which could be very useful to us. But they have no way to ship it to us, so I need someone who can travel up to the Deep and retrieve it."`
	"CN-4037" `	"Will your contacts also provide me with planets to refuel on along the way?"`
	"CN-4038" `	"The Deep is farther away than my fuel tanks can take me."`
	"CN-4039" `	"You'll have to bribe some Dirt Belt worlds into letting you land, to get there," he says. "Or, you could wait for the next time there's a ceasefire. But here's the great part: if this works, you won't need to pay any bribes on the way back, because the new technology we're after is a super-efficient ramscoop. What do you say?"`
	"CN-4040" `	"Okay, I'll give it a try."`
	"CN-4041" `	"Sorry, this sounds way too risky to me."`
	"CN-4042" `You land your ship by night in a private hangar that you assume is owned by one of the elite families on <origin>. Your contact is wearing a black mask over his face. That seems unnecessary to you, but perhaps he is just really enjoying the thrill of being involved in something illegal. He hands you a data card and says, "This contains all the information you will need to build your own Catalytic Ramscoop. And before you leave, you may also visit our private outfitter and purchase one of your own, if you wish."`
	"CN-4043" `	"May I ask who you are and why you sympathize with us?"`
	"CN-4044" `	"You can call me... Agent Falco. As to my true identity, naturally you will understand that I cannot divulge it."`
	"CN-4045" `	"I wish you the best of luck in your struggle against the evil plutocrats," he says. "May we yet live to see the day when all people live in prosperity and freedom. Farewell, brave insurgent." It is an overly dramatic speech, and sounds like he's been rehearsing it for a while. You respond with what you hope is a properly elegant salute, and he leaves.`
	"CN-4046" `Soon after you land on <origin>, you receive an anonymous message. It reads:`
	"CN-4047" `	Thanks to your assistance, the Delta V engineers have succeeded in duplicating Deep Sky's new ramscoop technology. The ramscoop is one piece in a larger plan we have to shift the tide of this war in favor of the Free Worlds, and to bring about an end to the conflict more quickly. If you are interested in hearing more, please visit <planet>, and our representatives will contact you promptly.`
	"CN-4048" `		The Free Worlds Wolf Pack`
	"CN-4049" `You have never heard of this organization before, but you know that "wolf pack" is pirate slang for a temporary alliance formed for the sake of taking on a target larger than any one band of pirates could handle alone.`
	"CN-4050" `Soon after you land, two men in militia uniforms approach your ship, and tell you they represent the "Wolf Pack." They introduce themselves as Rex and Fido; you're pretty sure those are not their real names.`
	"CN-4051" `	Once you are in a private room inside your ship, Rex, who is the younger one, says, "With ramscoop technology, our ships will be able to venture deep into the Dirt Belt. Now, Captain, why do you think the Republic is so determined to hold on to the Dirt Belt, even if it means fighting bloody battles? It's clear that the tax revenue isn't worth it."`
	"CN-4052" `	"Maybe it's just the principle of not ceding territory without a fight."`
	"CN-4053" `	"Maybe they want the resources that the Dirt Belt produces?"`
	"CN-4054" `	"Maybe to keep a buffer in between our territory and the worlds that really matter to them, like Earth and the Paradise Planets?"`
	"CN-4055" `	"That might be part of it," says Rex, "but there is a larger reason."`
	"CN-4056" `	"Precisely," says Rex, "and one resource in particular is more important to them than all the rest combined."`
	"CN-4057" `	The man named Fido, who is older and has a thick beard, spreads out a map on the table. You recognize it as a chart of food prices throughout human space. "Food," says Rex. "The Dirt Belt is the breadbasket of the galaxy. And the Republic is full of teeming, overpopulated worlds that could never hope to feed themselves. If we cut off the supply of food, the Republic will be forced to make peace with us."`
	"CN-4058" `	Fido says, "We are proposing a concentrated effort to destroy the freighter convoys that bring food to the richest, most densely populated Republic worlds. When their citizens find themselves lacking basic supplies, they will demand an end to the war."`
	"CN-4059" `	"I'd be glad to join you. That does sound like a much quicker solution than our current policies that the Senate and the Council support."`
	"CN-4060" `	"You're trying to starve the Republic into submission? Won't that just add more brutality to a war that has already been far too bloody?"`
	"CN-4061" `	"In the short run, perhaps," says Rex. "But think how many lives will be saved - how many bloody battles will be averted - by forcing them to end this war quickly rather than dragging it out across years of time."`
	"CN-4062" `	"I don't buy your argument. If we use such reprehensible tactics to build our new society, the society we build will be as corrupt as the old one."`
	"CN-4063" `	"Okay, you've convinced me. What do you want me to do?"`
	"CN-4064" `	"Very well," says Rex. "Sorry for wasting your time." They leave.`
	"CN-4065" `	"First, you should buy a ramscoop here, if you haven't got one already," says Rex. "Then, your first target is a convoy of three freighters that will be departing from Big Sky in the Sarin system shortly. There may be escorts, but only the freighters themselves need to be destroyed."`
	"CN-4066" `You receive another message from the Wolf Pack: "Great work with those freighters, Captain! We've got another target for you, if you're interested: a pair of Bulk Freighters, which you ought to be able to intercept in the Gacrux system. It's an uninhabited system, so you shouldn't have much interference from the Navy. As before, you only need to destroy the freighters, not any other ships you encounter."`
	"CN-4067" `	Every one of these missions you complete will create more animosity between the Republic and the Free Worlds. But on the other hand, they may be right that it's the fastest way to bring this war to a close.`
	"CN-4068" `Rex meets up with you and thanks you for your continued service to the Free Worlds. "If we had a dozen captains as brave as you are," he says, "the war would be over tomorrow." He hands you <payment>, and walks away. You still don't know his real name or who the leaders of the Wolf Pack are, but you are glad to have been able to do something extra to assist the war effort.`
	"CN-4069" `You receive a short, encoded message from Freya: "Hi there, Captain! If you happen to be passing by <planet> any time soon, would you mind swinging by there to help escort a freighter convoy? We're working on the development of some exciting new equipment, and the convoy is carrying the supplies we need to complete the project."`
	"CN-4070" `Following Freya's instructions, you land on <origin> and tell the spaceport quartermaster that you've been assigned to escort a convoy to <planet>. "Ah yes," he says, "the last of their cargo was just made ready yesterday." He leads you to a cluster of landing pads where three Bulk Freighters are parked. "The pirates have not been much trouble lately," he says, "but the cargo is important enough that they wanted an escort anyway." He leaves before you have a chance to ask any questions about what the freighters are carrying.`
	"CN-4071" `You receive a message from Freya: "Hello again, Captain! Thanks for your help escorting the materials to Solace. Ever since we developed the Dreadnoughts people have been talking about how badly we need a generator that can meet their energy needs, and that's what Delta V Corporation has been working on. So, take a look next time you're on Solace or one of our other major manufacturing centers. Sorry for the mystery surrounding the cargo, but we didn't exactly want to advertise that a huge shipment of fissionable material was headed for Free Worlds space."`
	"CN-4072" `While waiting in <planet>'s spaceport for your ship to be refueled, you hear an announcement coming from an unseen loudspeaker. "Attention! The Free Worlds have withdrawn our presence from Greenrock. Be advised that any further travel to the Shaula system may carry the risk of pirate attacks." The message cuts off abruptly, only to repeat a few minutes later.`
	"CN-4073" `	A militia captain who paused nearby to listen to the announcement shakes his head before recognizing you. "Well, that's a damn shame, isn't it?"`
	"CN-4074" `	"Yeah, I risked my life and position taking Greenrock."`
	"CN-4075" `	"It was probably going to happen sooner or later."`
	"CN-4076" `	"We shouldn't have wasted the resources on it at all."`
	"CN-4077" `	"I suppose, but things should have gone differently. The Free Worlds, and the Pact before that, was founded to eliminate piracy from the South, so I thought it was the right thing to do. We really put the pirates on the wire when we went straight for their guts.`
	"CN-4078" `	"Well, the most obvious threat to the Free Worlds' sovereignty is the Navy. Attacking Greenrock hasn't helped in that regard."`
	"CN-4079" `	"Tomek's plan didn't work out, though. The other pirate planets didn't surrender when Greenrock fell, like he had wanted."`
	"CN-4080" `	"That's true. But we mustn't lose sight of our original goals, either. Piracy is a bloody stain on the Southern Rim, and every ship we lose fighting a petty war between Bourne and Earth is a ship that can't protect our families on Solace or Longjump from the horrors of piracy.`
	"CN-4081" `	"But now it looks like we'll have our hands full for the foreseeable future, and the pirates are going to make the most out of this for sure. Best to see this war over with."`
	"CN-4082" `	"I was at Shaula that day too, although it wasn't me who was commanding the ship. I thought my old captain did the right thing at that time, but he took the fall for it when the Senate began to butt their heads into our business. Even when Bourne decided overriding the orders of their most capable combat commander was a severe misjudgement, they go and disregard all our sacrifices in Shaula and throw Greenrock back to the jackals."`
	"CN-4083" `	"Perhaps the Senate made a wise decision this time around. After all, Tomek's plan relied on the rest of the pirate worlds surrendering after Greenrock, and that didn't happen."`
	"CN-4084" `	"There's little we can do now. The challenge now is the Navy, not the pirates."`
	"CN-4085" `	(Stay silent.)`
	"CN-4086" `	"You could make a case there. In the circumstances, it seemed like attacking Greenrock could have taken a lot of weight off our shoulders... but nonetheless, after the lull in action following Wei I think the Senate could have handled Greenrock far better."`
	"CN-4087" `	"That may be true, but I still believe it was a lost opportunity. We've had all this time since then to stabilize the situation in Shaula, yet the Senate has done nothing so they can prove the Greenrock occupation was a waste of resources."`
	"CN-4088" `	The militia captain continues, "It's really too bad, we really put the pirates on the wire when we went straight for their guts. But now it looks like we'll have our hands full for the foreseeable future, and the pirates are going to make the most out of this for sure."`
	"CN-4089" `	On that note, the two of you return to your duties.`
	"CN-4090" `You're having a drink in a dimly lit spaceport bar when you notice a group of young men in crimson leather outfits gambling in a dark corner. The barman eyes them warily. One of them raises his drink and waves you over, beckoning to join their game.`
	"CN-4091" `	(Join their game.)`
	"CN-4092" `	(Ignore them and leave quickly.)`
	"CN-4093" `	You walk over to the table. A closer examination indicates a strong likelihood that they are pirates; not one of them looks older than 19, and they all sport fearsome tattoos and dangerous-looking sidearms. After a few rounds of cards it becomes abundantly obvious that they're cheating, and making little effort to hide this from you.`
	"CN-4094" `	Fortunately, you're able to outsmart them anyway and win the game, winding up with a sizable pile of credit chips. They don't look too happy about it, but do not bother you as you quickly leave. You thank your lucky stars: you're nearly 25,000 credits richer and still in one piece after a face-to-face encounter with pirates.`
	"CN-4095" `	You're starting to bleed money, with more than 10,000 credits in losses already.`
	"CN-4096" `	(Call them out on their cheating.)`
	"CN-4097" `	(Say nothing and continue playing.)`
	"CN-4098" `	You grit your teeth and lose hand after hand before the game finally ends. The pirates gloat over their "winnings" of almost 15,000 credits as you leave.`
	"CN-4099" `	You confront them on their blatant cheating when the meanest-looking one growls at you, "We're just playin' a game here, see? You'd better shut your big mouth if you know what's good for you! We can make this ugly real fast."`
	"CN-4100" `	The thugs stare at you menacingly and start to reach for their guns.`
	"CN-4101" `	(Shoot first!)`
	"CN-4102" `	(Grab the pot and run!)`
	"CN-4103" `	(Let them fleece me.)`
	"CN-4104" `	Unfortunately, they're faster than you. Your mutilated corpse hits the floor with a wet thump.`
	"CN-4105" `	Grateful that you never leave your ship unarmed, your hand flies toward the pistol at your thigh. You draw the weapon and fire at the pirate who just threatened you. The slug punches a hole in the center of his chest, and he collapses to the ground. His shocked comrades fumble in horror for their weapons, but you've taken them by surprise and quickly gun down another before deciding it's time to escape. You grab some of the credits on the table on the way out!`
	"CN-4106" `	You dash toward the hangar bay and blast off in a hurry. You quickly count your spoils and see that you're nearly 25,000 credits richer! Halfway out of the atmosphere, the remaining two pirates hurl obscenities over the comms from their own ships, which are in hot pursuit.`
	"CN-4107" `	You grab the pot and make a break for it! The ruffians howl and draw their guns. Dodging gunfire, you run towards the door and get halfway there before one of the slugs finds its mark. You fall to the floor in pain, watching a pool of your own blood expand around you. You try to struggle to your feet, but the toughest-looking pirate kicks you to the ground and finishes you off with another shot.`
	"CN-4108" `	You grab the pot and make a break for it! The ruffians howl and draw their guns. You run towards the door in a zigzag motion as bullets fly past you and tear chips out of the walls. You glance backwards just in time to see the barkeep reduce one of the ruffians to hamburger meat with an enormous shotgun. The remaining three chase after you.`
	"CN-4109" `	You dash toward the hangar bay and blast off in a hurry. You quickly count your spoils and see that you're nearly 25,000 credits richer! Halfway out of the atmosphere, you receive a message from the port authorities warning you that while they apprehended two of the pirates, the remaining two made it to their ships and are in hot pursuit.`
	"CN-4110" `When you enter the <origin> spaceport, you're almost immediately stopped by a grizzled old man. "You some kinda rookie, or you asking for a death wish?" he asks.`
	"CN-4111" `	"Yeah, I'm pretty fresh. Is there something I'm doing wrong by walking in here?"`
	"CN-4112" `	"I've been piloting for a while. I think I know what I'm doing."`
	"CN-4113" `	The old man chuckles. "Ain't nothing wrong with walking in here. It's what you're flying in with that's the issue.`
	"CN-4114" `	The old man chuckles. "Well I don't think so after what I've seen.`
	"CN-4115" `	"I seen those ships of yours. That fleet is juicy pickings for pirates if I've ever seen it." You look confusedly at the man. "Oh, do I need to spell it out for you? Pirates love to take out soft targets with lots of potential cargo, and your fleet is looking pretty heavy on cargo space with hardly any defenses."`
	"CN-4116" `	"Oh, so that's why I've been seeing pirates everywhere I go."`
	"CN-4117" `	"So what should I do about that?"`
	"CN-4118" `	"Don't you think I know that already?"`
	"CN-4119" `	"What, you think they just had it out for you because you look funny? No, pirates have their reasons.`
	"CN-4120" `	"Either get yourself more guns in that fleet or get rid of some cargo space. Park your ships, sell them, doesn't matter, so long as the pirates don't see them, or you make it not worth it to try and steal whatever you might have. Pirates see a bunch of freighters flying around unprotected and they're going to take their chances. Doesn't matter if you actually have anything or not."`
	"CN-4121" `	"Thanks for the advice."`
	"CN-4122" `	"I'll make sure to go do that. Thanks."`
	"CN-4123" `	"No problem. Just looking out for a fellow captain. No use in getting got because you didn't know any better. But now you do." The man gives you a firm pat on the back before walking off.`
	"CN-4124" `	"Sure doesn't look like it." The man gives an exaggerated shrug and starts to walk off. "Alright then, get yourself killed. Not like I used to haul cargo from one end of the galaxy to the other for fifty years or anything." The man gets further and further away, continuing to grumble about "kids these days" and other such things until you can no longer hear him.`
	"CN-4125" `You walk into a bar in the spaceport looking for something to eat when a man sitting at a table in the corner looks up and takes notice of you. "It's Captain <last>, the famous warrior! Barkeep, give <first> a drink on my tab."`
	"CN-4126" `	"Glad to get some recognition. I work hard out here."`
	"CN-4127" `	"Famous warrior?"`
	"CN-4128" `	"Of course! Word travels fast in the galaxy, and word on the hyperspace lanes is that you're quite the fighter."`
	"CN-4129" `	"It doesn't help that you've pissed off the law, either," someone behind you says, not sounding too happy.`
	"CN-4130" `	More patrons take notice of the conversation and begin chattering amongst themselves. "Quite the force to be reckoned with, I've heard," you overhear one of them mumble.`
	"CN-4131" `	"You might want to watch your back," another says to you. "Plenty of pirates with more brains than sense might be looking to make a name for themselves by taking out such a famous captain. A person like you has to have some enemies, and you never know who might have put a price on your head. A bounty hunter could retire early on the fat purse they'd get from spacing you."`
	"CN-4132" `	"I'll be fine. My ship is strong enough to stand against anything."`
	"CN-4133" `	"Maybe I should go into hiding for a while."`
	"CN-4134" `	"Oh, I'm sure it is. You wouldn't have gotten this notorious without being able to hold your own."`
	"CN-4135" `	"You'd need to hide for more than just a while, but laying low in a small ship might help to stay off the radar of pirates and bounty hunters."`
	"CN-4136" `	After a few more minutes of mumbling, the bar returns to like it was before you entered. The food you ordered arrives and you dig in.`
	"CN-4137" `As you leave your ship and walk toward the cafeteria at the center of the spaceport, you notice a young couple standing near the edge of the landing area next to a cart loaded high with a jumble of boxes and furniture. Like many of the locals, they are both wearing dust masks over their mouths, and the woman is also wearing goggles.`
	"CN-4138" `	(Talk to them.)`
	"CN-4139" `	The couple introduces themselves as George and Samantha. As you shake hands with them, you notice that Samantha's eyes under the goggles are rimmed in red, and she keeps coughing quietly: a dry, careful cough. George explains that they came here several years ago to take jobs in the factories, but the volcanic fumes have been giving Samantha trouble ever since they arrived. They can pay <payment> for transport for themselves and <tons> of household goods to <destination>.`
	"CN-4140" `	They thank you for your assistance, and you give them a hand pushing the heavy cart into your cargo bay.`
	"CN-4141" `As you walk through the spaceport, you hear a voice behind you, saying, "Excuse me, Captain." You turn around and see a woman trying to flag you down. Her hairdo is tall and somewhat confusing; her high heels are also tall and are giving her considerable trouble as she walks towards you.`
	"CN-4142" `	"You look like the sort of captain I can trust," she says. "My darling Pookie has been visiting her aunt on Shroud, and it's time for her to come home, but she's not used to space travel and it scares her. I would feel so much better if you could go pick her up and bring her back here. Can you do that for me?" You can't help noticing that the jewelry she's wearing probably costs as much as a small fighter craft. This job sounds easy, and has the potential to be quite lucrative.`
	"CN-4143" `You called ahead while your ship was landing and agreed to meet Pookie's aunt at the spaceport. She told you, "Meet me outside the shop with the ridiculous sheepskin coats." The shop is not hard to find; the mannequins in the window look like feral sheep with overgrown wool in bad need of grooming.`
	"CN-4144" `	"Excuse me," you say. She looks up at you with a withering glare. "I'm looking for someone named Pookie."`
	"CN-4145" `	Eventually she looks up from the paper and sees you standing there. "Are you Captain <last>?" she asks. You nod.`
	"CN-4146" `	"Thank heavens," she says. "She's all yours." She hands you the leash and a large bag that appears to be full of chew toys. "Here are her toys, her food, and her... outfits. Which she hates. Feed her twice a day, or she will go berserk. Do not feed her more than twice a day, or she will throw up..."`
	"CN-4147" `	As she continues rattling off instructions, you ask, "Wait, Pookie is the dog?"`
	"CN-4148" `	"Short for 'Pocahontas,"' she explains. "Good luck, and I hope my sister pays you well." She walks away. There's nothing else you can do but bring Pookie back to your ship, where she immediately squats against the landing strut.`
	"CN-4149" `The weather on <origin> is unusually rough today; the sky ripples with thunder while rain whips against locals brave or desperate enough to stay outside. Through the mist, you see a building with neon lettering saying, "East Mesa Indoor Racing Complex: Bets are open!"`
	"CN-4150" `	(Stay dry in my ship.)`
	"CN-4151" `	You lean back in your seat and turn on your ship's heater. After a while, the neon sign shuts off, and the weather clears up.`
	"CN-4152" `	You wade through the mud as you approach the complex. At its entrance is a stout woman in a black uniform holding a shotgun. When she sees you, she looks at a list in her hand, before saying, "You're alright. Feel free to come in."`
	"CN-4153" `	The inside of the racing complex is packed to capacity. Around you is a swarm of elbows and shoulders, jutting into you while you worm your way through the crowd. The sounds of rancorous conversation blend in with the pounding of rain on the roof as you glimpse a sight of the main attraction: a large, fenced-off oval. White lines inside the area form racing lanes, and arranged on the far side of the track are four cages covered with cloth.`
	"CN-4154" `	As you reach the boundary of the track, a loud siren fills the air, causing the crowd to fall silent.`
	"CN-4155" `	"What's going on?"`
	"CN-4156" `	(Quietly observe.)`
	"CN-4157" `	When you try to open your mouth to speak, a hand shushes you, appearing as suddenly as it disappears.`
	"CN-4158" `	The siren ends, and a greasy voice takes its place. "Welcome, one and all, to the grand biweekly hound race! Before we collect your wagers, let me introduce you to our fine racing stock for the night!"`
	"CN-4159" `	A stagehand hops over the fence and towards the cages while the announcer continues. "Bleedbug is a veteran of the racing track. He's never taken the pole position, but perhaps this will be his lucky day!" The stagehand removes the covering of the innermost cage as a cheer rings out. The dog inside begins ferociously barking upon seeing the cacophony around him, but you can't help but notice how withered Bleedbug's body looks.`
	"CN-4160" `	"Our second hound is one that you're all familiar with. He's an 18-time victor of the track," the voice pauses, "even if some of his wins were only by technicality." Already, a jeer is rising in the audience. The announcer says, "It's the hound that you don't want to beat: Doom." The booing reaches a peak as the stagehand takes the cover off of the largest cage of the lineup, revealing a gargantuan hound. Doom's body is finely defined, devoid of his competitor's malnutrition. As soon as he sets his eyes on Doom, Bleedbug stops yelling and retreats to the corner of his cage to whimpering. Pleased at his reputation, Doom lets out a thunderous bark.`
	"CN-4161" `	(Join in with the booing.)`
	"CN-4162" `	You pump your fists into the air and join in on the jeering until you are interrupted by the announcer speaking.`
	"CN-4163" `	You silently observe the crowd's boos die when the announcer continues speaking.`
	"CN-4164" `	"Now, our other two racers for the day are all-new." A murmur of anticipation sweeps through the audience. "Our first newcomer is a fine lady. Rumored to be from the wilderness of Zenith, can everyone put their hands together for Zinc!" The cover over the third cage is taken off to reveal a creature that is clearly not a dog. Her long, gray fur and piercing, golden eyes mark her as a far more graceful and feral beast, though underneath her coat, you spot atrophied muscles. Zinc initially stands unfazed by the crowd and the other dogs, calmly observing her surroundings. When Doom spots the wolf ignoring him, he begins to bark louder and louder, until she abruptly stares at him with an inscrutable expression.`
	"CN-4165" `	"Our final contestant for the day is a most... unorthodox choice. The merchant who graciously donated her to us came with a most fascinating story. She said that the hound comes from the Paradise Worlds, and her owner wanted the pet to have a luxury flight to her holiday home. Well, let's see if she can pay her way to victory here, folks." The audience snickers. "Now, give your best welcomes to Puny!" Puny is easily the frailest of the dogs, barely more than skin and bones. White whispers of hair clump around her head, chest, and ankles, and the bottom of her cage is wet. None of the other racers acknowledge her, but the crowd is rearing to volley a variety of curses and slurs at her, as though an actual Paradise World baron was in the cage. As you look at the poodle, you can't help but feel a strange sense of familiarity.`
	"CN-4166" `	You feel your back get nudged, and turn to see a woman dressed in rags holding four buckets filled with credits. The names of the racers are crudely written on each of them. "Betting is 3,000 credits," she says unusually sweetly.`
	"CN-4167" `	(Bet on Bleedbug.)`
	"CN-4168" `	(Bet on Doom.)`
	"CN-4169" `	(Bet on Zinc.)`
	"CN-4170" `	(Bet on Puny.)`
	"CN-4171" `	"I'll pass."`
	"CN-4172" `	You dig through your pockets for a credit chip to toss into the bucket, until you realize that you don't have enough money to make a bet. Impatient with your bumbling, the woman turns to take money from a person next to you.`
	"CN-4173" `	You toss a chip into the bucket, and the woman eagerly turns towards a person next to you.`
	"CN-4174" `	The woman turns to take bets from a person next to you.`
	"CN-4175" `	After several minutes pass, the siren sounds, and the announcer speaks again. "Once again, we at the East Mesa Racing Complex give our thanks to everyone who supports our cause by participating in betting. Now, without further ado..."`
	"CN-4176" `	A red light on the ceiling turns on, and the audience shouts, "Three!" A second one lights up. "Two!" A third light, this time yellow, turns on. "One!"`
	"CN-4177" `	A green light appears, and the crowd descends into chaos as the cage doors open.`
	"CN-4178" `	The first to move is Bleedbug, desperate to get as far away from Doom as possible. Doom himself has his eyes set on a different target. As soon as the doors open, he rushes over the lane lines towards Zinc and bares his teeth for a bite. Anticipating this, Zinc dodges beneath the attack, and lunges in with her mouth open. Doom responds to the threat by lowering his head and bashing into her, and the two animals are quickly locked into a brutal mess of teeth and blood. The crowd goes wild at the spectacle unfolding before them as the brawl approaches your section of the fence.`
	"CN-4179" `	(Continue watching.)`
	"CN-4180" `	(Get away.)`
	"CN-4181" `	Looking on, you are suddenly thrown backward when the beasts smash into the fence in front of you. Lying on the ground, you look down and see Zinc and Doom tearing into each other outside of the track, inches from your feet.`
	"CN-4182" `	(Get up and back away.)`
	"CN-4183" `	(Lie still.)`
	"CN-4184" `	As you lie still, Zinc is kicked on top of you, and Doom dashes in to continue the brawl. Within seconds, your skin is ripped to ribbons by two animals too deep in bloodlust to notice that another body has joined the fray. You bleed out on the floor as the crowd cheers at the slaughter of a fellow human.`
	"CN-4185" `	You scramble to your feet, barely dodging Zinc as she's kicked back by Doom. As the two animals howl in pain, you push your way through the onlooking crowd, hoping to escape the danger. After getting some distance away, you turn back to see Zinc and Doom continuing to go at each other's throats.`
	"CN-4186" `	You turn and head away from the fence. Moments later, you hear two cries of pain accompanying the sound of wood splintering. Peeking back, you see that Zinc and Doom are fighting outside the track, with the crowd raving at the sight of violence.`
	"CN-4187" `	(Stay and watch.)`
	"CN-4188" `	(Leave the building.)`
	"CN-4189" `	You look on at the duel, as does the rest of the building. The crowd has already taken sides, with some shouting Zinc's name and others shouting Doom's. Doom initially appears to have the upper hand, ramming himself into Zinc with impunity as she is sent sprawling. However, when Doom goes in for another tackle, Zinc dashes in and sinks her teeth into his neck. His roars of pain diminish into whimpers as blood spills readily on the complex's floor.`
	"CN-4190" `	Suddenly, a gunshot rings out throughout the building. The two beasts fall over as the stagehand steps forward holding a shotgun. The crowd is left in silence for a moment, until they start to jeer and boo, angered by the unsatisfying end to the duel. The stagehand responds by pointing his gun up and firing again. "That's enough!" he yells. "If you freaks want your bloodsports, then go to the gladiator stadium, or a cockfighting ring. But this establishment will not support such degeneracy!" The crowd goes quiet, but out of the corner of your eye, you see some mean-faced figures reach into their pockets.`
	"CN-4191" `	(Get out before it gets ugly.)`
	"CN-4192" `	(Stay for a while longer.)`
	"CN-4193" `	Continuing to look on, you hear a loud bang to your right as the stagehand gasps in pain and collapses. You turn to see that a mustached man next to you has his gun raised. Before you can react, you hear another gunshot and see a spurt of blood erupt from the man's temple. Almost instantly, the entire audience is up in arms as gunfire comes in from every direction. Acting instinctually, you duck down and crawl through the forest of legs towards the exit. Once there, you reach your hand up and push the door open before running out.`
	"CN-4194" `	As you turn around, you hear a volley of gunshots from behind, and decide to run out of the building, tackling the door open.`
	"CN-4195" `	You head towards the exit, pushing aside audience members completely captivated by the fight. Flinging the door open, you hear a gunshot from behind, and decide to run out.`
	"CN-4196" `	As you step outside, you are greeted by sheets of rain lashing you. The strength of the torrent almost causes you to fall backwards, but you manage to steady yourself. You take a glance back at the racing complex to find that the guard in the black uniform is missing. You turn to begin the trek back to your ship, but halfway there, you feel something touch your lower leg.`
	"CN-4197" `	(Turn around.)`
	"CN-4198" `	(Run away.)`
	"CN-4199" `	You begin to run, but slip in the mud and fall on your face. You roll over to come face-to-face with a dour-looking dog eyeing you. Sitting up, you recognize the poodle as Puny, who must have snuck out of the complex during all the commotion. As you get off of the ground, Puny looks up at you with puppy-dog eyes.`
	"CN-4200" `	You turn around and come face-to-face with a dour-looking dog looking up at you with puppy-dog eyes. Inspecting it, you recognize the poodle as Puny, who must have snuck out of the complex during all the commotion.`
	"CN-4201" `	(Pet her.)`
	"CN-4202" `	(Shoo her.)`
	"CN-4203" `	You crouch down and rub the soggy tufts of hair on Puny's head. As you continue, a smile creeps onto her face, beaming in spite of the soaking rain. You think about what to do with her.`
	"CN-4204" `	(Bring Puny aboard my ship.)`
	"CN-4205" `	(Shoo Puny off.)`
	"CN-4206" `	You pick up Puny and carry her onboard. As you dry yourselves, you think back to what the announcer said about Puny being owned by someone from the Paradise Worlds, and wonder where you might be able to drop her off.`
	"CN-4207" `	As you step into the cockpit, you recall the bet you put on the hound race. Looks like you won't be getting your money back.`
	"CN-4208" `	You wiggle your leg around to scare Puny off. She runs into the mist, vanishing from sight. You turn back and manage to reach your ship, changing into a dry set of clothes.`
	"CN-4209" `After landing on <origin>, you look for a way to reach as many people on the planet as possible in order to find Puny's owner. One of the receptionists at a planetary information desk says that she can put out a notice for a lost dog on a planetwide notice board, if you're able to put in a detailed enough description of Puny. You describe the poodle's appearance to the best of your abilities, and also mention how she was traveling for a vacation when she was abducted.`
	"CN-4210" `	When you check back with the receptionist the next morning, she tells you that nobody has approached the offer.`
	"CN-4211" `You put a description of Puny on a planetwide notice board. By the time the next day arrives, you've received no offers in response.`
	"CN-4212" `When you land on <origin>, you look for a way to reach as many people on the planet as possible in order to find Puny's owner. One of the receptionists at a planetary information desk says that she can put out a notice for a lost dog on a planetwide notice board, if you're able to put in a detailed enough description of Puny. You describe the poodle's appearance to the best of your abilities, and also mention how she was meant to be transported to a vacation location before being abducted.`
	"CN-4213" `You approach a receptionist to put a description of Puny on a planetwide notice board.`
	"CN-4214" `	The next day, you visit the receptionist. When she sees you, she tells you that one message came in response, saying that the dog was theirs. You copy the address provided and hail down a taxi.`
	"CN-4215" `	The address brings you to a stark white mansion upon a cliff overlooking the ocean. A path snakes down from the entrance of the mansion to a large, gold-plated gate. You bring Puny out from the taxi and ring the doorbell next to the gate. A minute later, a servant in a prim suit approaches. As soon as she sees him, Puny straightens up, holding her head high.`
	"CN-4216" `	"I'm <first>, and I'm here to return a missing pet."`
	"CN-4217" `	(Wait quietly.)`
	"CN-4218" `	The servant says, "Ah, you're the one with the dog. Come inside, mistress has been expecting you."`
	"CN-4219" `	When he spots you, the servant says, "Welcome. Come inside, mistress has been expecting you."`
	"CN-4220" `	The walk to the front of the house is arduous; you pass through several different stadium-sized gardens along the way, each dedicated to a different type of biome. Looking up at the sky, you see the remnants of clouds contort unnaturally around invisible pillars. As you follow the servant, he looks back at you repeatedly, checking that you're still following. You decide to look behind yourself, and see Puny eagerly following. She has somewhat recovered from her time on Freedom, but her body is still little more than skin and bone.`
	"CN-4221" `	By the time you reach the mansion, your skin is slightly sunburnt. The servant walks up to the oddly tall door and presses the doorbell before moving to the side, hands folded behind his back. The bell is answered by a woman with a monstrous hairdo, barely able to fit in the doorway. Puny breaks into barking as soon as she sees her, but the woman ignores the barking and says, "Walters, who is this?"`
	"CN-4222" `	"It's the captain who put out a description of Pookie, Madam Pemefrey," the servant replies.`
	"CN-4223" `	When she hears this, Pemefrey's expression changes from annoyance to elation. "Really? Oh, I can't thank enough for this, dearie. How was it rescuing her? Did you have to barter with smugglers to track her down? Chase down kidnappers to free her? Battle with warlords for her safety?"`
	"CN-4224" `	"It was an adventure and a half saving her."`
	"CN-4225" `	"It wasn't anything too hard."`
	"CN-4226" `	"Wait, did you say Pookie?"`
	"CN-4227" `	"I'm sure it was. Now, where's my darling Pookie?"`
	"CN-4228" `	"Oh. Well, where's my darling Pookie?"`
	"CN-4229" `	Pemefrey chuckles haughtily. "Of course? Why, did you not realize that the purebred you saved is none other than the great Pocahontas? Now, show me my darling."`
	"CN-4230" `	You pick up Puny and show her to the lady. When she makes eye contact with the poodle, her face contorts with anger. "What do you take me for, some kind of Dirt Belter?"`
	"CN-4231" `	"Hey, I'm from the Dirt Belt!"`
	"CN-4232" `	"I'm sorry?"`
	"CN-4233" `	She tosses her head to the side. "Then I mean it twice as much!"`
	"CN-4234" `	She hisses. "If you wanted to be sorry, then you should never have tried to trick me in the first place!"`
	"CN-4235" `	Pemefrey thrusts an accusing finger at Puny. "My dog would never be as scruffy, as ugly, as this mutt! You are trying to deceive me by picking some mongrel off of the street and claiming it as mine!"`
	"CN-4236" `	Walters walks up to his master, saying, "But Madam, how could this captain provide such an accurate description of how Pookie was abducted if-"`
	"CN-4237" `	Pemefrey snaps her head to look back at her servant. "Walters! I thought you were on my side!" She holds her hands on her chest. "It would be such a shame if you ruined our friendship like this. Why, I wouldn't be able to bear to keep you around if you betrayed me like that."`
	"CN-4238" `	Walters shoots a desperate glance at you while stepping back, but otherwise says nothing.`
	"CN-4239" `	"Now, where was I... oh, right. You. Out. Now." She claps twice, jumping Walters to attention, who beckons you and Puny back to the gate of the mansion.`
	"CN-4240" `	You slam the door of the taxi shut as Walters locks the gate. The return journey is somewhat somber, with even Puny wearing a frown. When you look back up from Puny, you find yourself in a far more humble region of <origin>. The grandiose manors built into impossible locations are far distant, replaced with a small suburban town that would not look out of place in the Dirt Belt were it not for the picturesque mountain ranges surrounding it.`
	"CN-4241" `	While this town is less wealthy than the neighboring estates, it is still unmistakably on a Paradise World, with the street lamps scrubbed and polished to a wasteful degree. As you pass through the commercial district, your eyes catch a sign that says "Antette and Co. Animal Adoption Agency."`
	"CN-4242" `	(Investigate.)`
	"CN-4243" `	(Ignore the sign.)`
	"CN-4244" `	You tell the taxi driver to stop the car and you walk into the adoption center, leading Puny behind you.`
	"CN-4245" `	The inside of the agency is decorated with pale blue wallpaper. To either side of you are rows of plastic chairs, and in front of you is a receptionist looking down at his nails. When he notices you, he lazily says, "Welcome, welcome. What can I do for you."`
	"CN-4246" `	You point down at Puny and say, "Could you find a home for this dog?"`
	"CN-4247" `	The receptionist leans over the counter to look. "Wow, that's a sorry-looking puppy. What's her name?"`
	"CN-4248" `	"It's Puny."`
	"CN-4249" `	"It's Pookie."`
	"CN-4250" `	"I don't know."`
	"CN-4251" `	"That's a nice name." The receptionist steps forward to pick up the poodle before saying, "We'll make sure Pookie gets plenty of care and love. Thank you for bringing her to us."`
	"CN-4252" `	The receptionist winces. "That's... I'm sure we can come up with something better." He steps forward to pick up the poodle before saying, "We'll make sure she gets plenty of care and love. Thank you for bringing her to us."`
	"CN-4253" `	"Well, I'm sure we'll figure out a name for her eventually." The receptionist steps forward to pick up the poodle before saying, "We'll make sure she gets plenty of care and love. Thank you for bringing her to us."`
	"CN-4254" `	You exit the center and head back to your taxi for the rest of the trip back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-4255" `	You lean back in your seat as the taxi passes through the town without interruption. Not long after you find yourself back in the spaceport, with Puny still in your care. With nowhere else to go, you decide to bring Puny aboard your ship. As you lead her, she happily strolls up the landing ramp and settles into one of your bunks.`
	"CN-4256" `You wander into one of several dimly lit, smoke-filled bars near your docking bay. Soon after you sit down, a pair of hooded figures stand up and begin moving toward you. They aren't carrying any visible weapons, but on a station like this one there's a good chance that everyone you meet has a concealed gun. One of them is carrying a bundle wrapped in cloth. You can't see their faces.`
	"CN-4257" `	(Get out of here.)`
	"CN-4258" `	(Wait and see what they want.)`
	"CN-4259" `	You've heard too many stories of kidnappings and murders on this station to be willing to take any risks. You quickly get up and leave the bar, and walk down the passageway back toward your ship. Glancing behind you, you see that the hooded figures have decided not to follow you.`
	"CN-4260" `	The hooded figures turn out to be a boy and a girl, both perhaps thirteen or fourteen years old. The bundle in the girl's arms is a baby. "Are you a captain?" the boy asks.`
	"CN-4261" `	"Yes," you say.`
	"CN-4262" `	"We're looking for passage off-world," he says. "My cousin works in the refineries on Arabia, and I'm hoping he can get me a job there."`
	"CN-4263" `	"I don't want to be involved in anything illegal. Are you in some sort of trouble with the law?"`
	"CN-4264" `	"Well, how much would you be able to pay me?"`
	"CN-4265" `	The boy grins. "No, not at all. I mean, aside from the fact that we're pirates."`
	"CN-4266" `	Seeing the incredulous look on your face, the girl says, "Members of a pirate gang. Crew on a pirate ship. Captains are usually older, but most of the pirate ships you see out there are crewed by kids like us. It's a hard place to grow up. We want something better for our daughter."`
	"CN-4267" `	They are silent for a long moment, looking down at the table. Finally, the boy says, "We're crew on a pirate ship, hardly better than slaves. The captain keeps our wages. We don't get paid anything unless they agree to let us go. But if you help us start a new life, we'll work hard and some day we'll pay you back."`
	"CN-4268" `	The girl adds, "You don't know what it's like for a little girl to grow up on a pirate ship. We want something better than that for our daughter."`
	"CN-4269" `	As you are conversing a bearded man and a rough-looking teenage boy enter the bar and begin looking around the room. "That's our captain," she says. "Please, you have to help us. There's a service tunnel that connects to the back entrance of the bar. We can escape through there."`
	"CN-4270" `	You've heard of these service passageways: the most dangerous part of this lawless station, dimly lit and seldom traveled, except by drug addicts and prostitutes. This whole thing might just be a ruse to lure you into one, where they can attack you without anyone interfering. "No," says the boy, "if we head for the service tunnel, they'll be sure to notice us. Let's just stay at the table until they go away."`
	"CN-4271" `	The baby begins to cry, softly, and she bounces it gently, trying desperately to quiet it. "Shh. Shh." For the moment, it falls silent.`
	"CN-4272" `	(Try the service tunnel.)`
	"CN-4273" `	"I'm sorry, this isn't worth risking my life for. I'm leaving."`
	"CN-4274" `	You stand up and leave. The men in the doorway make no effort to stop you.`
	"CN-4275" `	The boy stands up. "Wait ten seconds, then head to the tunnel," he says. He walks into the bathroom, which is right next to the back entrance that she pointed out. You wait for a few seconds, then stand up. "Don't run," says the girl. "Walk slowly. Pretend. You've had a bit too much to drink. We're headed out back to find some privacy." You don't dare look behind you to see if the men in the doorway are watching you.`
	"CN-4276" `	Finally, you reach the back entrance, and she spins the wheel to unlock it. The hinges squeal, but it opens enough for you to squeeze through. You find yourselves in a narrow corridor lit only by flickering sodium lamps. In the yellow lamplight her face and hands look pale, jaundiced. The floor of the corridor is littered with beer bottles and discarded hypodermic needles. To one side of the door are several over-stuffed trash cans. As you step into the corridor, a rat scurries away into the darkness.`
	"CN-4277" `	A few seconds later, watching through the open airlock, you see the boy walk out of the bathroom. He can't help stealing a quick glance towards the men in the doorway, after which he quickly ducks through the airlock and slams the door shut. "Run!" he whispers.`
	"CN-4278" `	You begin running down the corridor, in the direction of your ship. You pass a man, slumped over in a corner; there is no time to see if he is dead, or just sleeping. In places the lights have gone out, and it is so dim that you can barely see the floor beneath you. Your footsteps pounding on the metal decking ring terribly loud up and down the empty hallway.`
	"CN-4279" `	Eventually the passageway widens out into a maintenance room, full of humming equipment and large tanks. You duck behind one of them and listen for sounds of pursuit. "I think we're safe," says the boy. He walks over to another airlock door on the opposite wall and tugs it open. Light pours in, almost blinding at first. You are looking out into the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. Crowds of people are walking past, paying no attention to you. He glances quickly in both directions, then gestures for you to follow.`
	"CN-4280" `	You wait at the table, pretending that you are busy placing a drink order. The men at the door do not leave. Instead, they step into the room and begin circling around the edge of it. "What berth is your ship in?" asks the boy. You tell him. "Wait ten seconds, then follow," he says. He stands up and walks through the door. The searchers glance at him as he leaves, but they must be looking for two people together, because they ignore him.`
	"CN-4281" `	The searchers approach the bar and begin talking to one of the bartenders. You and the girl stand up. "Walk slowly," she hisses under her breath. "Saunter. Don't run." You put an arm around her shoulders and do your best to act like an ordinary bar patron headed home with a new friend after having a bit too much to drink. You don't dare to glance at the bar to see if you are being watched.`
	"CN-4282" `	Finally you reach the door. You are in the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. It is crowded and brightly lit. You quicken your pace slightly and begin walking toward your ship, still afraid that if you break into a run, you will attract attention. The girl keeps glancing at the shop windows that you pass by: checking the reflection to see if anyone is following you. "They're leaving the bar," she says. And then, "They're walking in the other direction. I think we're safe."`
	"CN-4283" `	You pass a narrow doorway, probably an entrance to one of the service tunnels. The boy is standing there, holding a gun by his side. His grim expression softens somewhat when he sees you approaching.`
	"CN-4284" `	You quickly make your way back to your ship. As soon as the door has closed behind you, all three of you breathe a sigh of relief. A second later, the baby begins to wail, loudly. As you show them to their bunks, they introduce themselves as Joe and Maria; the baby's name is Jesse. "I don't know how to thank you," says Maria.`
	"CN-4285" `	"Please don't take too long leaving the station," adds Joe. "But, I think we'll be safe here until you're ready to leave. There's no way they can search all the ships at the dock."`
	"CN-4286" `As soon as you have landed, Joe finds a computer terminal and tries to look up his cousin who works here, but with no success. You go with him to the company office, where after a short wait you are ushered in to meet with a foreman. After Joe introduces himself, the man says, "I'm really sorry to tell you this, but Leroy died in a refinery fire several months ago."`
	"CN-4287" `	Joe is crestfallen. After a long silence, you say, "Sir, do you have any work available for Joe? He and his family were hoping to be able to put down roots here."`
	"CN-4288" `	"I'm sorry," says the foreman, "but we've had a ton of immigrants recently. The waiting list for new jobs is about five months long. They could stay here and hope for the best, but if they need work right away, they would be better off going to one of the Syndicate worlds, like <planet>."`
	"CN-4289" `	(Volunteer to take them to <planet>.)`
	"CN-4290" `	(Leave them here and hope for the best.)`
	"CN-4291" `	Despite his shock and grief, Joe is quite grateful. "You know we can't pay you, right?"`
	"CN-4292" `	"Don't worry about it," you say. You return to your ship and tell the bad news to Maria.`
	"CN-4293" `You help Joe and Maria, and their daughter Jesse, to carry their few belongings down to the immigration desk, where a clerk lists the job openings available and asks them each to fill out a skill survey. Maria says, "Captain <last>, I don't know how to thank you, but I promise you that once we've got steady jobs, we'll save up and pay you our fare for transporting us here."`
	"CN-4294" `	You wish them the best of luck, and return to your ship.`
	"CN-4295" `When you land, you are surprised to find a message waiting for you from Joe and Maria, the young couple you transported from Smuggler's Den to Millrace a year ago to help them and their baby escape their lives as pirate crew members. "Dear Captain <last>," they write, "we promised you we would save up enough money to pay you back for transporting us. Attached is <payment>. Thank you for giving us a chance at a new life." They've also enclosed a picture of themselves and their baby Jesse, who is now more than a year old.`
	"CN-4296" `As you're coming in for a landing, you realize that Millrace is where Joe and Maria live, the couple you transported from Smuggler's Den. They recently wrote to you thanking you for helping them to begin a new life. Do you want to stop by and see how they are doing?`
	"CN-4297" `	You contact Joe and Maria and they say they would definitely enjoy seeing you. On your way to the workers' barracks where they live, you stop by a small store and buy some chocolate, plus bread and fresh fruit and some canned goods you think they would be able to use. They thank you for coming and welcome you into their home. Jesse is continuing to grow up, and they have another baby too, now. Joe says the work in the factories is exhausting, and the hours are long, but they never need to worry about where their next meal will come from, or what they'll be required to do to earn it. You leave feeling very glad that you have been able to make such a difference in someone's life.`
	"CN-4298" `A group of <bunks> scientists approaches you and asks if you would be willing to take them and <cargo> to the abandoned planet of Hope, and then back home from there. "The transport we'd arranged for bailed out on us at the last moment," says their leader, a middle-aged man wearing thick-rimmed glasses. "We have 80,000 credits allocated for payment."`
	"CN-4299" `	"What sort of research are you doing?"`
	"CN-4300" `	"Sorry, I don't have space for you."`
	"CN-4301" `	"You probably know about the supervolcano that forced the evacuation of Hope some decades ago," he says. "My family lived on Hope back then. We want to measure how much ash is still in the air, to see how long it will be before the glaciers recede and the planet is habitable again."`
	"CN-4302" `	"That sounds like a worthy cause. I'd be glad to transport you."`
	"CN-4303" `	"Sorry, I'm not going to be headed in that direction any time soon."`
	"CN-4304" `	"Thank you," he says. You help them to load their meteorological equipment onto your ship.`
	"CN-4305" `You fly around the planet to several different sites that the scientists have identified as good places for their equipment. They also make some deep radar scans of the glaciers. "That's my old house, down there," says one of the scientists, pointing to the radar picture of one of the buried villages. "Under thirty meters of ice, now."`
	"CN-4306" `	The lead scientist hands you forty thousand credits, and says, "Here's the first part of your payment. Now we need to get home to <planet>. I'll pay you the rest once we get there."`
	"CN-4307" `As you are walking through the spaceport, a young man approaches you and says, "Excuse me, Captain. Is there any chance you're traveling towards the Core?" He's probably in his late teens, barely more than a kid.`
	"CN-4308" `	"I'm sure I could work that into my plans. Where are you headed?"`
	"CN-4309" `	"You're traveling all by yourself? You aren't in any trouble, I hope?"`
	"CN-4310" `	"Sorry, I don't expect to be headed that way any time soon."`
	"CN-4311" `	"Well, here's the story," he says. "My girlfriend's father won't let us get married until I have some money saved up. They say there's plenty of jobs to be had on <planet>. So I'm headed there to put down roots and get myself established, then in a year or two she can come and join me. Don't worry, I have <payment> that I can give to you."`
	"CN-4312" `	"I'd be glad to take you there."`
	"CN-4313" `	"Are you sure about that? I've heard some bad things about the Syndicate's company towns."`
	"CN-4314" `	"Do you really think she's going to wait around for you?"`
	"CN-4315" `	"Me too," he says, "but it's a lifetime of steady work, and you know how hard that is to come by in this part of the galaxy. Can you help me out?"`
	"CN-4316" `	"She'll be true to me," he says, with absolute confidence.`
	"CN-4317" `	"Okay, I'll take you to <planet>."`
	"CN-4318" `	"Sorry, I'm not headed in that direction."`
	"CN-4319" `	"Thank you, Captain," he says, shaking your hand. You bring him aboard your ship and show him to one of the empty bunks.`
	"CN-4320" `On the dirt near your landing pad is parked a large wagon, hitched to a draft horse and loaded down with furniture and various farming implements. A family is gathered in the shade of the cart, and several goats and sheep are tied up behind it.`
	"CN-4321" `	(Approach the farmers.)`
	"CN-4322" `	(I'm not interested in carrying livestock in my shiny new space ship.)`
	"CN-4323" `	The farmers introduce themselves as Jim and Annette Patterson; their kids are Erin, Kyle, and Sarah. "Any chance you've got space for <tons> of livestock?" asks Jim. "The droughts the last few years have been fierce, and we're hoping to start a new homestead on <planet>. We have <payment> saved for payment."`
	"CN-4324" `	"Sure, I'd be glad to take you there."`
	"CN-4325" `	"Sorry, that's way too far from here."`
	"CN-4326" `A woman in a well-tailored suit approaches you. "Captain <last>?" You nod. "Are you available for a transport job?" she asks.`
	"CN-4327" `	"Not right now."`
	"CN-4328" `	"My name is Becca," she says. "I'm a stage manager for a band, and the transport we had under contract bailed out on us. Any chance you could take <fare> and <tons> of cargo to <destination>? Given the circumstances, we can pay quite well."`
	"CN-4329" `	"Sorry, I'm not headed in that direction right now."`
	"CN-4330" `	"Great," she says, "I'll tell the boys to start loading their gear into your ship." About a half an hour later the road crew begins carting instruments and amplifiers into your cargo hold. Soon after that, you hear the roar of a crowd in the distance and another group of men comes running into your ship. "We're with the band," they say. "Quick, shut the hatch." Half a minute later, a mob of people has surrounded your ship and a few of them are even climbing on top of it. It takes you a second to realize they're not angry or bent on destruction - they're just a group of crazy fans.`
	"CN-4331" `	"Happens everywhere we go," says one of the musicians, calmly, as he watches a video feed of the mob on one of your monitors. He tells you that he's Ulrich, the lead singer. Then he introduces the rest of the singers and musicians.`
	"CN-4332" `	"Pleased to meet you all. What's the name of your band?"`
	"CN-4333" `	"Oh," Ulrich says, "we call ourselves, 'There Might Be Riots.'"`
	"CN-4334" `	Eventually, the spaceport police arrive and disperse the crowd, and the band settles in for their trip to <destination>.`
	"CN-4335" `You drop off the band "There Might Be Riots" on <destination>. Along the way, you got to hear some of their music, which is mostly characterized by frenzied instrumentals, a very energetic brass section, and bizarre lyrics. One day while you were in transit, they nearly drove you insane by playing their catchy but nonsensical song "Henhouse In Your Soul" for four hours straight, but other than that they have been good passengers, and their stage manager gives you an incredibly generous payment of <payment>.`
	"CN-4336" `	"We've already got a gig lined up for tonight," says Ulrich. "Want to come? We'll give you free tickets." Given how well they just paid you, it might be worth going just to build a relationship with the band, even if not for the music itself.`
	"CN-4337" `	"Sorry, I've got other things to do."`
	"CN-4338" `	The band is even louder in concert than they were when practicing in the confines of your ship. About thirty minutes into the concert, the energy of the crowd and the surreal lyrics finally begin to soak in, and rather than seeming meaningless their music feels fraught with meaning that hovers just beyond your grasp.`
	"CN-4339" `	Finally the band announces that their last song will be "Sad Archie." You've never heard of it, but the fans scream in approval. It's a slow, ballad-like song about a man named Archie who lives forever and is sad because the friends he makes all grow old and die. Archie has a pet dragon, and he builds a beautiful house for the dragon, but the dragon dies young. Archie is so sad seeing the dragon's house empty and gathering dust that he rents it out to some friends, but they fight with each other and trash the place. The story makes no sense, but some of the fans are wiping away tears as the song ends.`
	"CN-4340" `	Becca, who is sitting next to you in the VIP section, says, "We learned years ago that we need to end every concert with a sad song. Otherwise the fans leave with way too much energy and start destroying public property."`
	"CN-4341" `	The concert ends, and you say goodbye to the band. They say they'll be in touch if they ever need a ride again.`
	"CN-4342" `As you walk through the spaceport, you see a large crowd gathered outside a small pub, and hear the unmistakable music of There Might Be Riots from inside. The concert seems to be just winding down. Do you want to wait around and say hello to them?`
	"CN-4343" `	(Okay.)`
	"CN-4344" `	"<first>!" says Ulrich, when they see you. "What luck! We're doing a concert tonight on landing pad ninety-four, part of our 'Trouble on the Tarmac Tour.' We're going to need a lift to <planet> right after the concert. Or possibly in the middle of it. Can you help us out?"`
	"CN-4345" `	"Okay. But why the hurry to leave?"`
	"CN-4346" `	"Sorry, I've got other plans."`
	"CN-4347" `	"Please," he says, "I'm serious. You'll be saving our skins. Whatever else you've got, it's not this important."`
	"CN-4348" `	"Okay, I'll do it. Why's it so urgent?"`
	"CN-4349" `	"Sorry, I really don't want to work with you guys anymore."`
	"CN-4350" `	"You'll see," he says. "You should park your ship right behind us in case the natives get restless and we need to skedaddle."`
	"CN-4351" `	With some trepidation, you sit by the hatchway of your ship and watch as the band sets up directly outside it and the concert begins. Nothing seems out of the ordinary until the band introduces a song called "Gluttony," and you can feel a sudden tension fill the air. The Syndicate security guards, who until now have been standing at the periphery of the landing pad, begin to disperse themselves throughout the crowd.`
	"CN-4352" `	It's a song about a man who will die if he ever stops eating, so he eats more and more and grows bigger and bigger. A second after you realize that the whole thing is a thinly veiled critique of the Syndicate, a group up front unrolls a banner that reads "End Wage Slavery!" and begins shouting and chanting slogans. As the band plays on, there is some sort of scuffle at the back of the crowd, and then you see stun guns begin to flash, and rising plumes of what you would guess is tear gas.`
	"CN-4353" `	As the demonstrators are driven away, a group of guards approach you. "What is your connection to these musicians?" they ask.`
	"CN-4354" `	"I'm just their transport. They're paying me to carry them to their next destination."`
	"CN-4355" `	"They're friends of mine. Why? They haven't done anything illegal, that I can see."`
	"CN-4356" `	"Be careful what friends you choose," says the guard, "or you might find that no one in this sector will offer you any jobs. Now, get them packed up and get out of here." You have no choice but to leave the planet immediately...`
	"CN-4357" `	"Then I suggest you do your job and transport them. Immediately." The guards leave. As soon as the band is packed up, you leave the planet...`
	"CN-4358" `As generous as before, the band pays you generously: <payment>. "Where will you be going next, from here?" you ask.`
	"CN-4359" `	"Who knows," says Ulrich. "Our music has taken us throughout human space, and beyond."`
	"CN-4360" `	"What do you mean, 'beyond' human space?"`
	"CN-4361" `	"Well, I'll look forward to the next time we meet."`
	"CN-4362" `	Ulrich launches into a story. "Years ago when the band was young and we had a month off in between gigs, we found an old gray merchant captain with a glass eye and asked him to transport us to one of the Paradise worlds for an extended 'drug vacation,' if you know what I mean. He said, 'Boys, why don't you leave the drugs behind, and I'll take you on a real mind-altering trip,' and a few days later we were playing a concert on this world where the people were giant squirrels. They loved our music, too. Of course, these days that story isn't half as interesting as it once was."`
	"CN-4363" `	Ulrich launches into a story. "Years ago when the band was young and we had a month off in between gigs, we found an old gray merchant captain with a glass eye and asked him to transport us to one of the Paradise worlds for an extended 'drug vacation,' if you know what I mean. He said, 'Boys, why don't you leave the drugs behind, and I'll take you on a real mind-altering trip,' and a few days later we were playing a concert on this world where the people were giant squirrels. They loved our music, too. Never did find anyone who could take us back there, though."`
	"CN-4364" `	You're tempted to laugh, but he sounds serious. "Well," you say, "if I ever find a planet of intelligent squirrels, I'll be glad to take you guys there." You help them to unload their stuff, and say goodbye for now.`
	"CN-4365" `	"It sounds like you were visiting Hai space," you say, and you describe the aliens who live beyond the wormhole. "Yeah, that would be them," says Ulrich. "I'd love to go back there some time, but for now we have commitments closer to home." You help them to unload their stuff, and say goodbye for now.`
	"CN-4366" `	"Well, now that they're not hiding away anymore, seems like you might have a new market you could go back to," you say.`
	"CN-4367" `	"I'd love to go back there some time," says Ulrich, "but for now we have commitments closer to home." You help them to unload their stuff, and say goodbye for now.`
	"CN-4368" `As you walk through the spaceport, you see a distinctive group of people lugging a collection of instruments: the band There Might Be Riots. Would you like to see if there is anything more you can do for them?`
	"CN-4369" `	They're very happy to see you. "You always seem to have amazing timing," says Ulrich. "We were just wondering who could transport us to a... gig of sorts... up north, and then you come along. Any chance you could take us to <destination>?"`
	"CN-4370" `	You've heard of that planet. "The weapons testing world for Lovelace Labs?" you ask. "I'm surprised you'd be able to find a big audience there."`
	"CN-4371" `	"Oh, we'll have an audience, all right," he says. "We've just put out a new album called 'Songs for the End of Civilization.' A war protest album. We want to film ourselves playing a concert right in the middle of the missile testing range. Of course, we'll probably end up running out of there with Republic Intelligence nipping at our heels. What do you say?"`
	"CN-4372" `	"Sounds like a worthy cause. Count me in!"`
	"CN-4373" `	"You're going to do a concert on ground that could be littered with unexploded ordnance?"`
	"CN-4374" `	"Sorry, that's further than I'm willing to go for you guys."`
	"CN-4375" `	"Yeah. What an adventure!" he says. "Come on, it will be worth it."`
	"CN-4376" `	"Are you sure?" he asks. "We'll pay you with more than just money. Do this for us, and I'll share a story with you that very few have heard."`
	"CN-4377" `	"Sorry, but it's still a 'no.'"`
	"CN-4378" `	"Okay, I'm intrigued. But it still sounds risky."`
	"CN-4379" `	"Great," he says. "Now, the only question is where we'll go afterwards until the fuss dies down. Say, did you ever find that planet of squirrel people? We'd love to go back there."`
	"CN-4380" `	"Yes," you say, "they're called the Hai. They live in a whole big region to the north."`
	"CN-4381" `	"Great," he says. "Now, the only question is where we'll go afterwards until the fuss dies down."`
	"CN-4382" `	"Didn't you say the Hai really liked you before?" you ask. "I think now might be the perfect opportunity to go back to the Hai."`
	"CN-4383" `	"Aww yeah!" he exclaims, "those squirrel people were rad cool. We go thumb our noses at the military industrial complex, then you take us to stay with the peaceful squirrel people where the government won't bother us."`
	"CN-4384" `	Once more, they begin loading their stuff onto your ship, while you chart a course to <destination>.`
	"CN-4385" `	"Great," he says. "Now, the only question is where we'll go afterwards until the fuss dies down. I was thinking it'd be a great chance for our band to reconnect with the squirrel people - what did you call them?"`
	"CN-4386" `	"The Hai," you say.`
	"CN-4387" `	"Excellent," he says. "We go thumb our noses at the military-industrial complex, then you take us to stay with the peaceful squirrel people where the government won't bother us."`
	"CN-4388" `You bring your ship to a gingerly landing in a section of the testing range that doesn't look too pockmarked with craters, and the band begins setting up their equipment and video cameras. "This is great," says Ulrich. "We'll be broadcasting live over the Net. It's time people started asking why the government thinks it needs all these weapons of war."`
	"CN-4389" `	The band plays through about a third of their set without any evidence that the locals even know you are here, which is surprising for such a tightly secured planet. Then, right in the middle of a particularly crunchy anti-war song, your long-range radar picks up something: a large number of ships approaching from a hundred kilometers away.`
	"CN-4390" `	"Guys, I think we should get out of here."`
	"CN-4391" `	"We've got ships incoming. Could be trouble."`
	"CN-4392" `	The band stops playing. Ulrich turns to the cameras and says, "For all our fans out there, we'll be back after a brief intermission." Then he walks over to you and says, "What is it?"`
	"CN-4393" `	"Ships incoming," you say.`
	"CN-4394" `	The band stops playing. Ulrich turns to the cameras and says, "For all our fans out there, we'll be back after a brief intermission." Then he walks over to you.`
	"CN-4395" `	"Did they hail us?" asks Ulrich.`
	"CN-4396" `	"No," you say.`
	"CN-4397" `	He swears, then shouts to the rest of the band, "Gentlemen, time to pack it up posthaste, before we get turned into a tragic industrial accident!"`
	"CN-4398" `	The band has just packed the last of their equipment away when the ships come into view. It's a swarm of unpiloted combat drones, and they seem to be engaged in mock combat with each other. But, their flight path is taking them straight in your direction. You power up your shields just as the first of the drones decide that your ship is a valid target for their lasers...`
	"CN-4399" `You drop off There Might Be Riots on Allhome. Ulrich is looking around the spaceport in wide-eyed excitement. "This is it, guys!" he says. "We're back in the land of the peaceful squirrels. Captain <last>, I don't know how to thank you, but here's a start." He hands you <payment>.`
	"CN-4400" `	As the rest of the band begins unloading their things, Ulrich adds speaking more quietly, "And, in good minstrel fashion I will pay you not just with money, but with a story.`
	"CN-4401" `	"Back when the fame first became too much for me, I rented a shuttlecraft under an assumed name and went tooling around the galaxy just to get away from it all. I found some cloudy star out along the Rim, parked my ship where no one would bother me, shut down everything but life support, and just sat there meditating and enjoying the silence for two or three days.`
	"CN-4402" `	"Then suddenly clear as day I heard a voice say, 'Are you okay? Do you need anything?' I was so shocked that without even thinking I said, 'I'm fine. How about you?' And the voice told me he was sad. Sad, because that part of space used to be the home of another species, and now they're all dead. He said we humans built our cities on the graveyards of a great civilization and didn't even know it. And if we didn't stop fighting each other, our species would die off too.`
	"CN-4403" `	"That's when the band started to speak out against war."`
	"CN-4404" `	"Do you think the voice was real, or just in your head?"`
	"CN-4405" `	"It sounds like a good warning. I'll try to take it to heart."`
	"CN-4406" `	"It was in my head," he says, "And it was real. Very real. When it spoke I felt like the whole galaxy had just tipped sideways, or like I'd just stepped too close to the edge of a cliff and got vertigo. I've imagined some crazy things, but I tell you, this I did not imagine."`
	"CN-4407" `	You wish him the best of luck in Hai space, and he heads off into the spaceport with the rest of the band.`
	"CN-4408" `	"Then best of luck to you," he says, and he heads off into the spaceport with the rest of the band.`
	"CN-4409" `During your brief stop on <origin>, it occurs to you that it really is a shame to have a cargo hold full of the finest of illegal drugs, and not to take even a small sample for yourself. There is no way the loss of a tiny bit of drugs could be noticed. Give it a try?`
	"CN-4410" `	(No, I never touch that stuff.)`
	"CN-4411" `	(Sure, sounds like fun!)`
	"CN-4412" `	The room begins to spin, and strange things happen...`
	"CN-4413" `You'd begun to doubt the wisdom of your decision to transport this band of cutthroats from the moment you agreed to it, but the money was too good to resist. You settle into the captain's chair and prepare for the voyage ahead.`
	"CN-4414" `	But something feels wrong. You expect to hear the sounds of drunkenness and violence coming from the passenger compartment, but instead a deathly silence fills the air. You whirl around in your seat and come face-to-face with the entire gang. They're all armed. And their weapons are pointing at you. Your heart sinks.`
	"CN-4415" `	Their leader appears to be a lithe and dangerous-looking young woman who holds an enormous shotgun that's almost as big as her. "Looks like we boarded the ship of fools, and here's the biggest one!" she says mockingly. "We didn't have a credit to our names, but soon we'll own your ship. Hand over the access codes and we'll let you live."`
	"CN-4416" `	(Negotiate.)`
	"CN-4417" `	(Surrender.)`
	"CN-4418" `	That turns out to be a really bad decision. It's also your last. A truly excessive barrage of projectiles ends your life.`
	"CN-4419" `	"You don't want my ship, you want my money," you stammer, stalling for time while you try to think of a way out of this situation. "This ship is registered to me; nobody would believe that you came across it honestly. You want a fresh start in an anonymous ship. I'll give you 4 million credits, and you can buy a Modified Argosy or some other vessel better suited to your line of work."`
	"CN-4420" `	The gang leader snorts derisively. "Why don't we just kill you and hotwire this ship? That sounds more fun."`
	"CN-4421" `	(Offer more money.)`
	"CN-4422" `	You up your bribe to 8 million credits. It's enough. A sigh of relief escapes your lips as everyone lowers their weapons.`
	"CN-4423" `	You arrange for a merchant captain to transport the renegades down to the surface, along with a password-protected credit chip. Once the airlock closes, you send them the password. At least you have escaped with your life and your ship.`
	"CN-4424" `You go to the security station and bitterly hand over the ship's access codes.`
	"CN-4425" `	"Smart move," the leader says. "Or was it? Now we don't need you alive for anything, do we?"`
	"CN-4426" `	She fires her shotgun into you from behind, and for a brief moment, you are treated to the sight of your internal organs splattered all over the console. It's the last thing you ever see.`
	"CN-4427" `Somehow, miraculously, you manage to reach your gun before she fires. Perhaps it's the sheer brazenness of it - no one would expect someone staring down the barrels of half a dozen guns to actually draw against them. Nevertheless, you do, and it works.`
	"CN-4428" `	Your first shot finds its mark, and the gang leader crumples to the floor. The other thugs shriek in alarm and begin to spray gunfire in all directions, but it's ineffective panic fire. Taking cover behind the armored captain's chair, you dispatch two more with well-aimed shots.`
	"CN-4429" `	The remaining goons attempt to flee, but your fingers find the button controlling the bridge door and it slams down before they can escape. They throw down their weapons and surrender. You toss them into the brig and decide that it might be a hoot to take them to their original destination as prisoners instead of passengers, and see if you can get a bounty for bringing them in.`
	"CN-4430" `You receive a message informing you of an unusually large transaction: 8 million credits. The gang of cutthroats must have withdrawn the money you bought them off with. You are now free to continue your career - poorer, but hopefully wiser.`
	"CN-4431" `A man wearing a very complicated hat waves to you from the other side of a landing pad. "Yoo-hoo, Captain!" he says. "I have a courier mission for you if you're interested."`
	"CN-4432" `	(Find out what he wants.)`
	"CN-4433" `	(Ignore him.)`
	"CN-4434" `	"My name is Alphonse," he says. "I am a breeder of exotic lizards. A new client on <planet> has just ordered one, and will pay you <payment> to transport it. Naturally, being a live animal, it's a rush delivery; it needs to be done by <day>. What do you say?"`
	"CN-4435" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested in that sort of work."`
	"CN-4436" `	"Excellent!" he says. "Come, let me introduce you to your cargo." He leads you to a supply shed where an enormous lizard, taller than you and probably weighing several tons, is being held in a cage that looks far too flimsy for it. "I'll have my men load her aboard your ship at once," says the man, "along with some meat for her to eat on the journey. Watch out for your fingers when you feed her, by the way. Thank you!"`
	"CN-4437" `In the spaceport, you can't help but notice a group of six or seven men in ragged farm clothing, sitting by the edge of one of the launch pads. They are probably migrant workers looking for a lift.`
	"CN-4438" `	(Approach them.)`
	"CN-4439" `	You strike up a conversation with the workers. They say that they are tired of the seasonal fluctuations of farm work, and are looking for something a bit steadier and better paying. "We hear there's always work to be had in the mines on <planet>," they say. "Can you take us there? We've pooled together our savings, and can pay you <payment>."`
	"CN-4440" `	"No, sorry, I'm not headed in that direction."`
	"CN-4441" `While you are sitting at a table in a local cafe, a woman sits down across from you and says, "Pardon me, Captain. I wonder if you would be interested in helping with a humanitarian mission."`
	"CN-4442" `	"Tell me more."`
	"CN-4443" `	"Sorry, I'm too busy."`
	"CN-4444" `	"There's a flu epidemic on <planet>," she says. "It's a lawless world, so they have not been able to find any merchants willing to bring them medicine. But if they don't get a shipment of vaccine soon, the epidemic could become much worse, and even spread to other worlds."`
	"CN-4445" `	"Sorry, I don't believe in helping pirates."`
	"CN-4446" `	"Thank you," she says. "Your contact on <planet> will be a man named 'Raven Hunter.' Don't let anyone but him trick you into giving them the supplies."`
	"CN-4447" `After several shady characters have offered to buy the vaccines off you, or threatened to rob you, "Raven Hunter" finally shows up and collects them. He thanks you, and pays you <payment>.`
	"CN-4448" `As you are walking through the local market, a man says, "Captain, do you have room in your hold to bring food to a starving planet?"`
	"CN-4449" `	"Yes, but I hadn't heard news of a famine recently."`
	"CN-4450" `	"Sorry, not today."`
	"CN-4451" `	"No, this one wouldn't be in the news," he says. "It's <planet>, a lawless world. They're desperately in need of food, although it's mostly due to corruption and mismanagement of resources."`
	"CN-4452" `	"Well, it sounds like they're getting exactly what they deserve. And, I have no intention of risking my life to land on a pirate world."`
	"CN-4453" `	"Well, even so, no one deserves to starve to death. I'll help them."`
	"CN-4454" `	"Thank you," he says. "We'll load the food into your cargo hold immediately. The sooner you can drop it off on <planet>, the better."`
	"CN-4455" `It takes a while to figure out who exactly is in charge here. You sell off parts of your shipment of food to a few different local leaders, receiving <payment> in exchange.`
	"CN-4456" `You stop in to the spaceport bar for a drink. The bar seems to be frequented mostly by the managers of the mining corporation; you suspect the workers don't earn enough to visit a bar very frequently. In one corner, two of the managers are having a very animated discussion. When they see you, they say, "Hello there, Captain! Interested in taking us on a business trip?"`
	"CN-4457" `	"What sort of trip?"`
	"CN-4458" `	"Sorry, I'm just in here for the drinks."`
	"CN-4459" `	"To Glory, to the Academy of Planetary Sciences," he says. "This world is rich in resources, and we're thinking that if we could only cool down the deserts a bit and get more plants to grow here, it would be a decent place to live. We've been dreaming about this for years, and I think it's time to go pay a terraforming consultant to tell us whether it's actually possible or not."`
	"CN-4460" `	"Sorry, that's way too far away for me to travel right now."`
	"CN-4461" `You drop off the two managers from Rand, whose names are Eric and Alaric, at the Academy. While you wait for their meeting to end, you look around the lobby. The students have apparently just had some sort of science symposium, and poster boards are on display all along the walls. One of them catches your eye: the title is "Affordable Terraforming through Equilibrium Mapping."`
	"CN-4462" `	The basic concept of the poster seems to be that instead of altering the climate of a planet through brute force, it ought to instead be feasible to use a properly timed nudge in the right direction to cause the climate to shift toward a new equilibrium point that supports greater biological complexity. This student seems to think that planets naturally "want" to grow more complex and support more life, but that they sometimes get "stuck" in less optimum states.`
	"CN-4463" `	It's an intriguing idea. On the other hand, at the bottom of the paper, the professor has written, "Very poor scholarship. Do not anthropomorphize planets."`
	"CN-4464" `	Just then, Eric and Alaric return, looking disappointed.`
	"CN-4465" `	"No luck?"`
	"CN-4466" `	They shake their heads. "It would cost fifteen million just to bring a specialist out for an initial consultation," says Eric, "and besides, the cost of terraforming machinery and upkeep is prohibitive. I think this whole Academy is just a money-making racket."`
	"CN-4467" `	"Have a look at this poster. Maybe this student would help us. We could bill it as a sort of internship for her."`
	"CN-4468" `	"Indeed. They gave this student a failing grade just for suggesting it could be done more cheaply."`
	"CN-4469" `	They look at the poster. "Sounds almost too good to be true," says Alaric. "Hang on, I'll look her up in the campus directory." A few minutes later, he is on the phone with the student who made the poster. Her name is Amy. It turns out she is about to flunk out anyway, and is more than willing to travel back to Rand with you when offered a tiny fraction of what the consultant would have received.`
	"CN-4470" `	An hour later, you meet up with Amy, and arrange for her to join you on your ship before it takes off. Eric and Alaric are very excited, but you are a bit worried about the wisdom of entrusting their planet's future to someone so young and inexperienced.`
	"CN-4471" `Alaric, Eric, and Amy are having a heated conversation at a table in the bar. When they see you, Alaric says, "Okay, let's let Captain <last> be the tie breaker." He motions to you to join them.`
	"CN-4472" `	Amy explains, "Based on my data, it appears that Rand once had a cooler, more moist climate. But the trouble is, it has almost no axial tilt."`
	"CN-4473" `	"That means no changing seasons," explains Eric.`
	"CN-4474" `	"The result is that much of the planet is very hot, but the poles are very cold. Nearly all the planet's water has migrated to the poles and ended up frozen into the ice caps. Because the weather is so unchanging here, nothing ever prompts that water to melt and rejoin the hydrological cycle."`
	"CN-4475" `	"Well, that seems impossible to fix. It's not like you can rotate a planet's axis."`
	"CN-4476" `	"Are you suggesting melting the ice caps somehow?"`
	"CN-4477" `	"Of course not," she says. "But what we can do is introduce a sudden variation in the planet's climate that will allow water to be distributed more evenly across the surface again."`
	"CN-4478" `	"That would be the traditional terraforming approach," she says, "using orbital mirrors, or geothermal power, or something similar to evaporate the ice caps at a faster rate than new ice is being deposited. That approach would take a century or so."`
	"CN-4479" `	"This is where Amy's plan gets a bit scary," says Alaric.`
	"CN-4480" `	"I'm proposing crashing a medium-sized asteroid into the ice cap," she says. "If we pick the right asteroid, we can control the amount of dust that is created. The result will be a sudden influx of variability, that may allow the planet to revert to a wetter, more biodiverse state."`
	"CN-4481" `	"That is a stupid idea, and I want nothing to do with it."`
	"CN-4482" `	"Well, if you think it will work, I'm willing to try it!"`
	"CN-4483" `	"Great!" says Amy. "I'll mark the asteroid on your radar. You just need to board it, install a small ion thruster, and return here."`
	"CN-4484" `	Eric contacts some spaceport workers and has them load a small thruster onto your ship, along with the equipment you will need to mount it on the asteroid.`
	"CN-4485" `When you land, the sky already seems noticeably darker than before. Eric runs up to your ship. "You did it!" he says, excited. "A perfect hit. Now we just have to wait and see what the results are. Meet us in the spaceport bar again in a few hours, and Amy will have her initial measurements ready." He hands you a credit chip for <payment>.`
	"CN-4486" `By the time you meet up with Eric, Alaric, and Amy, the cloud cover already seems to have visibly increased. Amy is very enthusiastic. "Atmospheric water vapor is on the rise," she says. "The impact vaporized enough ice to form a small ocean. I wouldn't be surprised if we get a rainstorm here in a day or two."`
	"CN-4487" `	"What's next?" you ask.`
	"CN-4488" `	She says, "I'd like to travel with you to <planet>, and collect some seeds and cuttings from plants that can handle a cooler world with dimmer light, since that's what we'll have here until the dust settles down. I'd say we'll need about ten tons of cargo space."`
	"CN-4489" `	"Sorry, I need to move on to some other work now."`
	"CN-4490" `You meet up with Amy, and load the seeds and plant cuttings onto your ship.`
	"CN-4491" `	"Looks good, let's head back to Rand."`
	"CN-4492" `	"So, how do you plan to seed the whole planet with these, anyway?"`
	"CN-4493" `	She says, "My idea is to just disperse them in a few different locations, and trust that they will spread out over the next decade or so. We picked plants that are hardy and can spread very rapidly."`
	"CN-4494" `	"Sounds good to me."`
	"CN-4495" `	"What happens if the plants are too invasive, and choke out all the local wildlife?"`
	"CN-4496" `	"Well," she says, "in order to keep the climate on <planet> dynamic, they're going to need regular asteroid impacts every few decades. If these plants are too invasive, they can just wait an extra decade or so in between impacts and let the desert creep back in and kill off the invasive plants."`
	"CN-4497" `	"Okay, I guess that would work."`
	"CN-4498" `	"Wait, they're going to have to keep smashing asteroids into their world in perpetuity to maintain the new environment?"`
	"CN-4499" `	"For a century or so, yes," she says. "But that's a whole lot more economical than vaporizing the ice caps using traditional terraforming equipment. Come on, let's get back to <planet>."`
	"CN-4500" `When you get back to <planet>, Amy has you fly in a random path a few kilometers above the surface while she periodically dumps loads of seeds and plant material out the airlock. In the process, you fly through several rainstorms. This world's climate has indeed been altered. But you can't help wonder how a few tons of seed spread out over the entire surface of a planet is really going to help anything.`
	"CN-4501" `	Then you meet up with Eric and Alaric. Eric is elated. "We just got a massive rainstorm here!" he says. "We haven't had that much precipitation in a decade!"`
	"CN-4502" `	Alaric is less enthusiastic. "Flash floods washed out the road through the canyon," he says, "and very nearly flooded one of the mines, too."`
	"CN-4503" `	Amy says, "It will take a year or two for things to begin to settle down. Then we can figure out what our next steps should be."`
	"CN-4504" `	"I just hope we haven't made things worse than they were," says Alaric. He hands you your payment of <payment>. "Anyway, thanks for your help, <first>. It sounds like there's nothing more to be done here for the time being."`
	"CN-4505" `When you land on <origin> and exit your ship, you are stopped by a Navy officer with a group of guards. "Captain <last>. You are wanted for..." The officer pauses and looks down at the tablet in his hand. "The 'unlawful use of an asteroid.' You are to travel to <destination> immediately for questioning."`
	"CN-4506" `	"Understood, officer."`
	"CN-4507" `	"I'm wanted for what?"`
	"CN-4508" `	"The unlawful use of an asteroid, Captain. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I've been told to send you to <planet> by <day>. Your compliance would be much appreciated."`
	"CN-4509" `	"Alright. Hopefully I can get an answer as to what this is about."`
	"CN-4510" `You are quickly escorted from the crowded <planet> spaceport to a court building in a wealthy district of the city and asked multiple questions pertaining to the events on Rand. "Why did you purposefully crash an asteroid into a planet? What did you expect to happen? Do you know how many people could have died?" You answer to the best of your ability, and after roughly an hour of questioning you are transferred to a different room where you find Eric, Alaric, and Amy.`
	"CN-4511" `	"What are we going to do?"`
	"CN-4512" `	"Do you know what we're doing here?"`
	"CN-4513" `	"Apparently someone had a problem with us terraforming Rand," Amy says, looking rather disappointed.`
	"CN-4514" `	"Don't worry," Alaric says. "Our lawyer is on his way right now. We'll all be out of here by the end of the day."`
	"CN-4515" `	Alaric's optimism turns out to be justified, as the lawyer quickly finds that there are no actual laws on the books that define lawful or unlawful uses of an asteroid. Since no one was hurt by the asteroid impact and data that Amy had been collecting shows that Rand's climate has changed for the better so far, the case is quickly dropped and you are escorted back to your ship.`
	"CN-4516" `	Before you are able to leave, Amy stops you. "Could you meet me in the spaceport bar, Captain? I have some good news to share with you."`
	"CN-4517" `You find Amy in heated discussion with someone about her academy project, "Affordable Terraforming through Equilibrium Mapping." She takes a sip of her drink and invites you to sit down with them.`
	"CN-4518" `	"Hello, Captain! This is Nolan. He works in the Deep's Department of Terraforming Research and Application, and he contacted me after hearing about how we started terraforming Rand."`
	"CN-4519" `	Nolan outstretches his hand to you. "Nice to meet you, Captain."`
	"CN-4520" `	"Nice to meet you too."`
	"CN-4521" `	"I take it you're interested in Amy's ideas."`
	"CN-4522" `	"Absolutely. It's an extraordinary concept, and no offense to you Amy, but it's spectacular that someone of such little experience would imagine such a method of terraforming."`
	"CN-4523" `	Amy continues. "Nolan wants to help pursue research of my terraforming techniques. Would you be able to give us a lift to <destination>? I'll pay you <payment>."`
	"CN-4524" `	"Sorry, I have other places to be."`
	"CN-4525" `The spaceport is crowded with ships and people when you land. Amy's publication must have stirred up quite the commotion among terraforming scientists.`
	"CN-4526" `	Spaceport security clears a path to your ship for Amy, Nolan, and four people you do not recognize. You notice that a few among the crowd of people are jeering and holding signs, one reading "Don't asteroid my planet!" and a half-eaten sandwich gets thrown in Amy's path as she approaches.`
	"CN-4527" `	"Not everyone is as happy with the prospect of affordable terraforming as we are," Amy says to you as she boards your ship along with suitcases full of scientific supplies. "But that's no reason to stop, now is it?"`
	"CN-4528" `	Amy introduces you to the four others that she brought on board. Two of them are terraforming experts who helped Amy and Nolan with their research. The other two are representatives: one sent by the Republic Parliament in order to oversee the project, and another from Tundra.`
	"CN-4529" `	"Once you're ready, Captain, please bring us to <destination>. Tundra was a tropical world millions of years ago, but became cold after a cataclysmic event of some sort. There's a good chance that we may be able to nudge the planet back toward a warmer climate if we do this right."`
	"CN-4530" `The journey to Tundra was spent by your passengers discussing the possible methods of terraforming the planet. The Republic representative was none too pleased when Nolan, perhaps jokingly, suggested crashing an asteroid into it.`
	"CN-4531" `	Everyone except for the Tundra native begins to shiver after stepping out of your ship onto the planet, even while inside a protective dome. "Meet us in the spaceport bar in a few hours. We need to finalize our plans of how we're going to execute this experiment."`
	"CN-4532" `Amy, Nolan, and the other two scientists tell you the known history of Tundra's climate. Millions of years ago, an asteroid impact or large volcanic eruption altered the planet's atmosphere. Now, the planet no longer retains enough heat from its host star in order to stay warm.`
	"CN-4533" `	"Tundra's snow covered surface only exacerbates the problem, reflecting most of the star's light back into space," Nolan explains. "This means that we need to both alter the atmosphere in order for it to retain more heat and alter the surface in order for it to reflect less heat."`
	"CN-4534" `	Amy rolls out a map of the entire planet onto the table. Different regions of the surface are color coded, and a large red spot in the planet's southern hemisphere sticks out to you.`
	"CN-4535" `	"Tundra has very low volcanic activity, but seismic mapping has led us to this area." Amy circles the red spot with her finger. "Magma from the planet's mantle is building up under this area of the crust, which, lucky for us, is unusually thin. Still, it could be another ten thousand years before the magma builds up enough pressure under the surface to cause a supereruption, melting the snow around it and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that over time will raise the global temperatures."`
	"CN-4536" `	"So are we going to wait ten thousand years for it to erupt?"`
	"CN-4537" `	"How does this help our situation?"`
	"CN-4538" `	The Republic representative scoffs at your comment. "If we were then we wouldn't be here, now would we, Captain?"`
	"CN-4539" `	One of the other scientists responds, "What we plan to do is encourage the eruption of this volcano by making the crust above the volcano thinner. When the pressure of the magma is able to overcome the pressure of the crust, an eruption will occur."`
	"CN-4540" `	"How exactly do you plan to do that?" the Tundra representative responds. "And what will happen to the people who live near that area?"`
	"CN-4541" `	Nolan answers, "The people who live near the volcano will need to evacuate the area with all their belongings. The Republic should provide any assistance needed for the evacuation. As for how we will cause the volcano to erupt, we need something energetic enough to crack the planet's crust in the location of the volcano, releasing the pressure that the magma is causing to spark an eruption. That's where we bring in another asteroi--"`
	"CN-4542" `	"No, no, no!" the Republic representative exclaims, cutting Nolan off mid-sentence. "The Republic will not gain a reputation for crashing asteroids into its own planets. The consequences of such an action could be disastrous should it go wrong! And in what way will this warm the planet when the resulting volcanic winter could last decades and only result in an even colder climate? Are you not even old enough to remember how a supereruption on Hope caused the evacuation of the entire planet? If the people of Tundra are this desperate to terraform their planet then normal techniques should be employed, none of this 'equilibrium mapping' nonsense."`
	"CN-4543" `	"Sir," Amy speaks up with a stern tone of voice, "we have already been authorized by the Republic to undergo this terraforming experiment, so unless you have half a teraton of cheap explosives, we're going to need to use an asteroid. The volcanic winter can be easily avoided by having a fleet of freighters sweep the volcanic ash out of the atmosphere, meaning we'll get the benefits of the greenhouse gases without the detriments of volcanic ash reflecting Cebalrai's heat back into space. No one knew the volcano on Hope was going to erupt, but we can prepare for this eruption and take steps to mitigate the problems." Amy looks the representative straight in the eyes and smirks. "We're scientists, we have this handled."`
	"CN-4544" `	The representative falls silent. After a moment of thinking, he says "Captain, I need you to take me to Parliament. I may be able to authorize the use of explosives that should suffice, but it may not be as cheap as Ms. Amy is hoping. We're not about to turn asteroids into our single solution for everything."`
	"CN-4545" `	"I'll get my ship ready to launch."`
	"CN-4546" `	"Sorry, I have other things I could be doing."`
	"CN-4547" `	The representative leaves the bar. "We'll wait here," Amy says to you. "I'll speak with the Tundra government about evacuating the area around where the impact site will be so that we can start when you get back."`
	"CN-4548" `"Wait here," the Republic representative says curtly. Several hours later, he returns, not looking very happy. "What a waste of time. Parliament has declined my request. I don't much agree with this, but you will need to crash an asteroid into Tundra if you wish to achieve your goal." Before you ready for launch, you send a message to Amy and Nolan telling them that an asteroid will be used after all. You don't receive an immediate response.`
	"CN-4549" `Your ship is targeted by pirate fleets when you enter the system. Before you engage, you receive a message from Amy.`
	"CN-4550" `	"Captain, these pirate ships have been occupying the system for days. They must be taken out if we are to safely crash an asteroid into Tundra. If you aren't able to fight them, distract them until backup arrives."`
	"CN-4551" `The pirates that occupied the system did not make an effort to land on Tundra, but they did harass any merchant ships that passed through the system. The government of Tundra pays you <payment> for helping in ridding the system of the pirates, a pleasantly unexpected reward.`
	"CN-4552" `	You gather with the scientists in the spaceport bar. The Tundra native informs you that all residents close enough to the volcano to be in danger have been evacuated. "All we need to do now is find the right asteroid," Amy says, and after only a short time of searching, she finds the perfect candidate. "Just like last time, Captain."`
	"CN-4553" `	Spaceport workers load a small thruster and the equipment you will need to mount it on the asteroid into your ship.`
	"CN-4554" `A plume of debris has formed in a mushroom cloud shape above where the asteroid hit. The scientists are viewing their instruments in anticipation for what happens next.`
	"CN-4555" `	Almost an hour after the impact, the ground begins to shake slightly, even though the volcano is located hundreds of kilometers away. "This might be it!" Nolan exclaims as he closely watches a seismometer receiving readings from near the impact site. Suddenly the seismometer spikes, and another plume, much larger than the asteroid impact, rises from the impact site. Half an hour later, the low sound of the massive eruption can be heard in the spaceport, triggering another burst of cheers from the scientists. "It actually worked!" one of them yells out.`
	"CN-4556" `	You fly the scientists over top of the volcano, allowing them to take readings of the air and surface. "Greenhouse gas levels are off the charts!" Amy exclaims. "Once these gases disperse across the planet's atmosphere, they should begin warming the entire planet."`
	"CN-4557" `	The heat has formed a huge circle of melted snow around the volcano, revealing the green color of trees and the dull grays and browns of rock. Closer to the center of the eruption you spot dozens of lava flows emanating from the center of the impact crater.`
	"CN-4558" `	"It looks beautiful from up here."`
	"CN-4559" `	"Yes it does, Captain," the Republic representative says. "Yes it does."`
	"CN-4560" `	"First we need to clear all this volcanic ash out of the atmosphere, as otherwise the planet's temperature will drop, then we wait," Amy says to you. "We should be able to tell how this will affect Tundra's climate in a year or two."`
	"CN-4561" `	You steer your ship back to the spaceport. Amy pays you <payment> after you land. "Thanks for your help, Captain. We're going to stay here and monitor Tundra's climate as it shifts, so there's nothing more that we need you for."`
	"CN-4562" `When you land, you receive a message from Amy, the girl you helped to terraform Rand and Tundra.`
	"CN-4563" `	"I hope everything is going well, Captain. I just wanted to give you an update on what has occurred in the past year.`
	"CN-4564" `	"Tundra's climate has drastically improved. Areas around the equator are starting to become completely snow-free, and I was amazed when I was able to walk outside without a heavy coat on. The Republic has placed a halt on any more experiments, as they wish to see how the situations on Tundra and Rand turn out.`
	"CN-4565" `	"Speaking of Rand, last month I got to catch up with Eric and Alaric when I visited the planet. They've told me that Rand is becoming a far better place to live on now. It's even becoming a popular tourist destination. They wanted me to relay their gratitude to you for making their dream come true.`
	"CN-4566" `	"That's all I have to say. Thanks again for all the help. I don't know where I would be without it."`
	"CN-4567" `You hear a strange crunching sound coming from your cargo hold.`
	"CN-4568" `The worrisome munching sound in your ship's hold is followed by a horrific shrieking bleating noise and then an equally horrific silence. Turning on your cargo hold's security camera, you discover that there is nothing left of the goat and the cabbage that you were transporting except a few scraps of cabbage, some bones, and a lot of blood.`
	"CN-4569" `	Meanwhile, the wolf is calmly gnawing on what you suspect is the goat's femur, with a rather self-satisfied look in its eyes. Apparently the goat ate the cabbage, and shortly after that the wolf ate the goat.`
	"CN-4570" `The man who collects the wolf from you on the landing pad is furious. "I told the shipping company not to put the goat in the same ship as the wolf or the cabbage," he says, "but I guess they tried to save money by subcontracting it all to the same captain."`
	"CN-4571" `	Because you only delivered a third of the cargo safely, he only pays you <payment>.`
	"CN-4572" `As you are exploring the marketplace, a man wearing comically thick glasses comes over to talk to you. "Captain <last>?" he asks. You nod. "I hear that you're not averse to taking on risks," he says. "I'm the lead scientist on a project studying a spatial anomaly in an uninhabited system nearby. We had just launched a probe to study the anomaly more closely when a band of pirates arrived and forced us to flee the system. Would you be willing to travel there and see if you can retrieve the drone's data?"`
	"CN-4573" `	"How strong of a threat is the pirate fleet?"`
	"CN-4574" `	"Sorry, I don't have time to help you."`
	"CN-4575" `	"Just a couple of interceptors," he says. "We were in a scout ship, with no real weapons to speak of, and none of us on the ship have any combat experience. So, we felt it was safer to run away than to try to fight, even though we were leaving valuable equipment behind."`
	"CN-4576" `	"That doesn't sound like much of a threat. I'd be glad to help."`
	"CN-4577" `	"Thank you so much!" he says. "All I need you to do is board the drone and download its database. Unless the pirates have already stripped out the computer, of course. The drone is in the Terminus system, a few jumps away from here. We'll be waiting on <destination> for your return."`
	"CN-4578" `The scientist is overjoyed that you were able to retrieve the data from the drone. Almost in tears, he says, "We were worried that all our planning and fundraising had been for nothing. These measurements will help us to understand that spatial anomaly far better than we do right now." He hands you a credit chip worth <payment>. "And by the way, my name is Ivan. I have an office near the spaceport on Valhalla that you can visit if ever you're wanting to help, or just curious."`
	"CN-4579" `	"Can you tell me more about this anomaly you are studying?"`
	"CN-4580" `	"I'm glad I was able to help."`
	"CN-4581" `	Ivan says, "It seems to be a partially collapsed wormhole, something that once linked this part of the galaxy to somewhere else. But, we haven't succeeded in sending anything through it. Maybe the wormhole is no longer passable. Or maybe there's some way to make it open more fully. Or maybe only ships that are specially attuned to its energy signature can travel through it. We don't even know if the wormhole is a natural phenomenon or some sort of alien artifact. Honestly, we aren't sure if it's even a wormhole at all. We'll need to study the data you've recovered to understand it further."`
	"CN-4582" `	"A wormhole? Those actually exist?"`
	"CN-4583" `	"What makes you think it's a wormhole? Have you found anomalies similar to this before?"`
	"CN-4584" `	"Well of course. The existence of wormholes has been proven for some time now. The Deep managed to create wormholes on the atomic scale before the Republic was even founded." He lowers his voice. "But I suspect that you're asking about wormholes large enough for a ship to pass through."`
	"CN-4585" `	Ivan looks around the spaceport, as if checking to see if he's being watched. He then looks back to you and motions for you to lean in. Whispering, he says, "The Republic doesn't like when people share this information, but there is one stable wormhole just beyond the Republic's borders."`
	"CN-4586" `	"You mean the wormhole to the Hai?" you ask.`
	"CN-4587" `	"Interesting, you know of it," Ivan responds. "The anomaly in Terminus bears a striking resemblance to it in some of our readings, although it is very different in others."`
	"CN-4588" `	He looks around again and stands up straight. He then raises his voice, almost projecting it for anyone around you to hear. "But of course, the Deep never figured out how to make wormholes big enough for anything useful, otherwise we wouldn't even need hyperdrives," he says with a wink. "Anyway, thank you again for helping me. Hopefully we meet again in the future."`
	"CN-4589" `Wandering around the spaceport to see what it has to offer, you make your way into one of the dimly lit restaurants to avoid the crowded streets and metallic-tasting air outside. The restaurant is mostly empty. One of its only inhabitants is a dirty-looking woman crying with her head down in one of the booths.`
	"CN-4590" `	(Approach the woman and ask why she is crying.)`
	"CN-4591" `	(Ignore her and leave the restaurant.)`
	"CN-4592" `	As you walk close to the woman, she raises her head from her arms and brushes her hair out of her face to look at you. Tears run down her cheeks and her nose is running. "Wh-wh-what do you w-want?" she asks in a quiet voice, trying to speak through sobs.`
	"CN-4593" `	"Can I help you?"`
	"CN-4594" `	"Why are you crying?"`
	"CN-4595" `	You ask the woman if she needs help. She wipes away the tears with the sleeve of her shirt and tells you that she is looking for her son, Tod. "I sent him away to a mining job on Placer because I don't have the money to support him myself, but on the way the ship he was on was attacked and boarded by pirates." She begins to sob again. "I d-don't know if he's d-dead or a slave. I tried t-talking to someone from the Syndicate, but they said that saving him wouldn't be w-worth it.`
	"CN-4596" `	"W-would you be able to help? Please do if you c-can."`
	"CN-4597" `	"Alright, I'll help you. Where should I look for him?"`
	"CN-4598" `	"Sorry, I'm not going to risk my life for someone I don't know."`
	"CN-4599" `	The woman begins crying even louder than she was before. A waiter walks up to you and suggests that you leave before making the situation worse, and one of the few customers in the restaurant gives you a dirty look for making his meal experience even worse.`
	"CN-4600" `	You wait for the streets to become less crowded before leaving the restaurant. As you look back through the windows of the restaurant, you catch a glimpse of the woman still crying in the booth before the crowd blocks your line of sight and you continue walking.`
	"CN-4601" `	"Thank you s-so much! The closest pirate planet to here is <destination>. If he's still alive then I'm sure he would be there. I can feel it." The woman gives you a description of Tod Copper so that you may find him and thanks you again for agreeing to help her. She asks that if you find him to bring him to a location in the <origin> spaceport where she will be waiting.`
	"CN-4602" `The air in the <origin> spaceport smells of tobacco and tastes of the salt from the world's vast oceans. You receive sideways looks from rough-looking pirates, but none make a move to cause any trouble. As lawless as pirates can be, they still adhere to a form of honor code when in a planet's main spaceport. At least generally.`
	"CN-4603" `	You ask a bartender for directions to the local slave traders, as that is the likely place that Tod would be if he was taken here. He points you to a slave trader by the name of Cygnet Brig who "runs the slave trade 'round these parts."`
	"CN-4604" `	Cygnet owns a large warehouse building located on the edge of the spaceport island where he keeps all his slaves packed together in groups of three in small holding cells. Some slaves are rattling the bars on their cell or screaming in protest, but many have seemed to accept their fate. Cygnet, a tall, thin, mustachioed man, notices you gazing at the cells. "Can't keep 'em too packed together, oth'wise they's get each otha sick," he remarks in a thick accent of unknown origin to you. "What can I get ya?"`
	"CN-4605" `	"I'm here to buy a slave."`
	"CN-4606" `	"Do you have a boy by the name of Tod Copper?"`
	"CN-4607" `	Cygnet strokes his mustache. "Tod Copper. Tod Copper. Tell you what, that name doesn' ring a bell. Heck, I don' even keep track of names 'less I get someone impor'ant. If ya lookin' for someone in particular to buy, can I get a description?"`
	"CN-4608" `	You provide Cygnet with the description of Tod that his mother gave you, then explain to him that Tod would have been taken from a ship bound for Placer.`
	"CN-4609" `	"Oh yeah, that bugger! That little rebel was causin' me trouble so I sold him off soon as I could. If ya looking for him, then you're gonna need to look for a ship by the name of <npc>. They bought your boy Tod 'bout four days ago. Might be hangin' around a system nearby."`
	"CN-4610" `	You thank Cygnet, who has been surprisingly polite for a slave trader, for the information. "If ya ever need a slave, just come talk to me," he remarks as you walk back to your ship. "I've got the cheapest slaves this side of Sol."`
	"CN-4611" `When you breach the ship's hull, you find the crew of the <npc> more concerned with containing the fires caused by your weapons than with you walking onto their ship. Almost every one of the crew members is a teenager. One looks at you and the pistol in your hand with mortal fear in his eyes.`
	"CN-4612" `	Through the smoke and steam, you see a boy running toward you who fits the description of Tod Copper.`
	"CN-4613" `	"Get on my ship!"`
	"CN-4614" `	"Are you Tod?"`
	"CN-4615" `	"Yeah! Are you here to save me?"`
	"CN-4616" `	"Get on my ship!" you yell, motioning for him to come toward you.`
	"CN-4617" `	The boy runs past you and into your ship. Following closely behind Tod is a large bearded man holding a laser rifle in one hand and a fragmentation grenade in the other.`
	"CN-4618" `	"That's my crew member, you no-good piece of sh--"`
	"CN-4619" `	Before the captain is able to finish his sentence, pipes in the wall next to him explode, blasting hot steam all over the right side of his body, causing him to begin rolling on the floor in horrible screeches of pain. Not wanting to stay connected to the ship any longer than you need to be, you run back into your ship and fly away.`
	"CN-4620" `Tod's mother almost tears up at the sight of him as you approach. "Oh, my baby boy is alive!" she exclaims, running up and hugging Tod as his face reddens with embarrassment. "Are you hurt? Are you okay? Do you think you'll be fine?" Tod's mother asks, kissing his cheeks between each question.`
	"CN-4621" `	"I'm fine, Mom," Tod says in an annoyed tone of voice. Some things never change.`
	"CN-4622" `	The mother gives you a handful of credit chips. At a glance, you guess that they couldn't be worth more than 1,000 credits. "I know it isn't much for the work you've done, Captain, but it's all I have to give you in return."`
	"CN-4623" `	"Don't worry about it."`
	"CN-4624" `	"I'm sorry but I can't take this from you."`
	"CN-4625" `	"This is just so wonderful. There aren't many people around here who would do such a thing for such little pay."`
	"CN-4626" `	You hand the credits back to the mother as she begins to tear up again. "Thank you so much, Captain."`
	"CN-4627" `	"Hold on," Tod chimes in. "I still need to get to <planet>."`
	"CN-4628" `	"Of course!" his mother yells out. "Captain, would you please make sure that Tod has a safe passage to <destination>?"`
	"CN-4629" `	"And make sure I don't become a slave this time," Tod quips jokingly.`
	"CN-4630" `	"Okay, I'll take Tod to <planet>."`
	"CN-4631" `As with all Paradise Worlds, the air is just the right temperature when you step out of your ship, and a light breeze rustles the leaves of the trees planted around the spaceport. While taking a moment to breathe in the fresh air, you hear yelling coming from the entrance to the <origin> shipyard. Looking over, you spot a young girl with a backpack running from two spaceport security guards. "Get back here!" they yell at the girl, chasing her with no success.`
	"CN-4632" `	"Someone help me!" the girl shrieks out. As she runs, a credit chip falls out of her backpack.`
	"CN-4633" `	(Let her onto my ship.)`
	"CN-4634" `	(Ignore the scene.)`
	"CN-4635" `	The girl looks you in the eyes as she approaches, expecting help that will never come. Air rushes past you as she and the security guards run by. After a few meters, the security guards catch up to the girl, tackling her to the ground and detaining her as they remove her backpack full of credit chips.`
	"CN-4636" `	You open the hatch to your ship and yell "Get on!" as the girl approaches. "Thank you, Captain," she says while getting closer, to much protest from the approaching security guards.`
	"CN-4637" `	As she enters your ship, she grabs your arm and pulls you in with her before closing the hatch. "Launch and go to <destination>, now! I'll explain when we get there."`
	"CN-4638" `"You need to explain what is going on here," you say just after setting your ship down.`
	"CN-4639" `	"Alright, alright, I'll explain." You notice that the girl has a strange mix between a posh Paradise World accent and a Dirt Belt or possibly even Rim accent. "My name is Diana Howl. My father is the CEO of a large marketing firm. And this," Diana opens her backpack, revealing its full contents of thousands of credit chips, "this is part of my family fortune, about half a billion credits of it. Don't worry, my father should be able to make this back in a few months' time."`
	"CN-4640" `	"Why have you stolen all this?"`
	"CN-4641" `	"I'm calling the spaceport authorities."`
	"CN-4642" `	"No, wait! Let me explain!" Diana protests.`
	"CN-4643" `	"All my life I've been fascinated with the world outside my little bubble of the Paradise Planets. My father met my mother on Heartland in the Cor Caroli system while he was on a business trip, so my mother would often take me on trips to the Dirt Belt. The last time I went was before the war though; my mother didn't want me anywhere near the 'Free Loafers,' as she called them. Back then life in the Dirt Belt didn't seem anywhere near comparable to life in the Paradise Worlds, and I can only imagine how much worse it might be after being so close to a war, so I decided that I needed to do something to help.`
	"CN-4644" `	"Now, can you take me to <destination>? I wish to hand this over to the government there to help them. It may not seem like much in the grand scheme of how many credits go into running a planet, but it should be a huge boost to their economy."`
	"CN-4645" `	"Alright, I'll help you."`
	"CN-4646" `	"What makes you think they won't hand it over to your father?"`
	"CN-4647" `	"This is a crime. I don't want to get in trouble helping you."`
	"CN-4648" `	Diana pauses. "I hadn't thought of that," she says in a downtrodden tone, "but I at least have to try! Please just bring me to <planet>. Please!" Diana looks up at you with puppy dog eyes, quivering her lip with the backpack of credit chips held against her chest.`
	"CN-4649" `	"Alright, I'll bring you to <planet>."`
	"CN-4650" `	"Sorry, but I'm not putting myself on the line for this."`
	"CN-4651" `	"Excellent!" Diana yells out. She drops the bag of credits on the floor and gives you a hug. "We'll have to leave immediately, for I fear that the spaceport authorities here might be searching for us."`
	"CN-4652" `	You call the spaceport authorities and tell them that Diana Howl is on your ship. Moments later when they arrive, they take Diana kicking and screaming off of your ship. She yells harsh profanities at you as she is taken away, one among them being "Syndicate lover." As a reward for "catching" Diana, the spaceport authorities transfer 150,000 credits to your account.`
	"CN-4653" `Diana is eager to get going as soon as you land. "This is going to be great! I'm going to do so much good with this! I can't wait to see the look on their faces when I open up my backpack in front of them!" Diana says rapidly as she bounces up and down with the backpack of credit chips on her back.`
	"CN-4654" `	As you gather a few credits to bring with you in case you see something you want to buy, Diana bounces off the ship. Suddenly, her crazed rambling stops. Diana comes running back onto the ship yelling "We need to go! Fly to <destination>! The Free Worlds should protect me!"`
	"CN-4655" `	"What is it? What's happening?"`
	"CN-4656" `	(Launch immediately.)`
	"CN-4657" `	"Look outside," Diana says with a ghastly look on her face. You check your ship's external cameras, and roaming around your ship is a group of men in Navy uniforms. One of them raises a megaphone to his mouth.`
	"CN-4658" `	"Hand over the girl and her credits and we can all walk away from this peacefully, Captain."`
	"CN-4659" `	"Why do you need her?"`
	"CN-4660" `	"Over my dead body!"`
	"CN-4661" `	"Alright, I'll bring her out."`
	"CN-4662" `	"In case you haven't noticed, Captain, that girl is in possession of over half a billion stolen credits. She's a criminal, and helping her makes you a criminal too. Given your status, Captain <last>, I'd appreciate it if you didn't make me the officer that put <first> <last> behind bars."`
	"CN-4663" `	"I'm sorry officer, but I can't help you."`
	"CN-4664" `	"Okay, I'll hand her over."`
	"CN-4665" `	Diana looks to you in shock. "You wouldn't!" she screeches. "You can't! Fly me to <planet> right now!"`
	"CN-4666" `	"I'm not going to become a criminal to fulfill your crazy dream."`
	"CN-4667" `	"Okay, we'll fly to <planet>."`
	"CN-4668" `	You allow the Navy officer and his troops onto your ship, where they apprehend Diana and her stolen credits. They take her kicking and screaming off of your ship. She yells harsh profanities at you as she is taken away, one among them being "Syndicate lover."`
	"CN-4669" `	"Thank you for not causing any more trouble, Captain," the officer says to you. He then hands you 500,000 credits for "playing nice" and leaves.`
	"CN-4670" `	You activate your repulsor engines, sending the Navy troops recoiling away from your ship. As you ascend into space, your computers detect multiple ships targeting you.`
	"CN-4671" `While in flight, Diana tells you the stories that she heard of the war. In the Paradise Planets region, they were told that declaring independence and bombing Geminus and Martini was the Free Worlds' first step in overthrowing the Republic.`
	"CN-4672" `	"We should talk to Alondo," Diana says. "He'll be able to handle this situation."`
	"CN-4673" `	As you're coming in for a landing on Bourne, you receive a message from Alondo. "<first>!" he says. "I just heard that you were in system. Want to meet up for a drink and talk about old times?"`
	"CN-4674" `	"I'd be glad to any other time, but I need your help at the moment."`
	"CN-4675" `	As you're coming in for a landing, you contact Alondo, who is luckily on Bourne. "What have you gotten yourself into?" he responds after you mention that you need his help.`
	"CN-4676" `	"I'll explain the situation when we meet."`
	"CN-4677" `	You meet with Alondo at his office in the Free Worlds Senate building. After he and Diana exchange greetings, you explain the situation to him.`
	"CN-4678" `	"You what?" Alondo responds. "You have to turn her in. The war may be over, Captain, but there is still tension between the Republic and Free Worlds that we cannot have a situation like this exacerbating."`
	"CN-4679" `	"You can't do that!" Diana yells in protest. "I thought the Free Worlds were supposed to be all about going against the Republic, but you're just going to give in?"`
	"CN-4680" `	"Look here, kid," Alondo says in a stern tone. "The Free Worlds were never about being against the Republic, it was only ever about being against Parliament. There's a big difference there. What you've done is a crime, even to the Free Worlds. We are not about to gain a reputation of harboring criminals of the Republic."`
	"CN-4681" `	Diana, instead of protesting further, puts her head down. "I'll be in your ship, Captain," she says. Diana storms off, making an effort to create as much noise as possible with the stomps of her feet.`
	"CN-4682" `	"Spoiled kid," Alondo says quietly. "Attitudes like that are why I joined the Southern Defense Pact. Anyway Captain, I suggest you hand her over to the Navy immediately. I'll contact the Republic if you need me to."`
	"CN-4683" `	"Alright, I'll hand her over."`
	"CN-4684" `	"Sorry, Alondo, but I agree with her cause."`
	"CN-4685" `	Alondo breathes a sigh of relief. "You should probably go check on her. I'll message you where the Navy wants to pick her up."`
	"CN-4686" `	"I understand. Please, just don't drag the Free Worlds into this."`
	"CN-4687" `	You say goodbye to Alondo and return to your ship. When you arrive and look around, Diana is notably absent. In your pilot's seat she has left her backpack and a written note. The paper has noticeable tear stains in one of the corners.`
	"CN-4688" `Dear <first> <last>,`
	"CN-4689" `	I don't care about the credits anymore, but I can't go back to my family. I'll be too much of a disgrace, and I can't even imagine looking my parents in the eyes after what I've done. I've left the credits with you. You can do with them as you wish.`
	"CN-4690" `	I've taken this chance to escape from my old life. I want to become my own person in the world, and I want to do it on my own. Please don't come looking for me, because wherever I am I'll be happier than when I was with my parents. I've failed myself today, but I'm still going to strive for the betterment of the less fortunate. Thank you for trying to make my dreams come true, even if you couldn't succeed.`
	"CN-4691" `				Diana W. Howl`
	"CN-4692" `	You stare down at the backpack, stuffed full with over half a billion credits.`
	"CN-4693" `	(Hand the credits over to the Navy.)`
	"CN-4694" `	(Steal the credits.)`
	"CN-4695" `	You fold the note and slip it into the backpack so that you can show it to the Navy to explain why Diana is not with you. You contact the Navy's crime report hotline and tell them that you have the stolen credits. A few minutes later, they respond telling you that a fleet is waiting on <destination> to retrieve the credits.`
	"CN-4696" `	You fold the note and slip it into the backpack so that you can show it to the Navy to explain why Diana is not with you. Alondo sends you a message, telling you that the Navy says they are waiting on <destination> for the credits.`
	"CN-4697" `	You rip the note apart and begin counting the credits. In total, the backpack contains a whopping 525,894,400 credits. Over half a billion credits richer, you sit down and wonder what you will spend it on.`
	"CN-4698" `You spot a fleet of docked Navy ships as you come in for a landing. A small squad of troops gather around your ship after you land. You are greeted by a Navy officer upon exiting your ship and explain to him where Diana is, showing him the note she wrote.`
	"CN-4699" `	"That is unfortunate," he responds with a troubled look on his face. "We'll contact the Howl family about this." Before letting you go, the officer hands you <payment>. "This is the reward that Mr. Howl put out for the return of his credits. Thank you for doing the right thing, Captain."`
	"CN-4700" `You are approached by a Navy officer. "Are you Captain <last>?" You nod. "Would you be able to assist us? A sizable gang of pirates has occupied <system> and raided the spaceport. A Navy fleet is on its way to eliminate the pirates, but reports from the planet indicate that the spaceport of <planet> is in dire need of supplies. Any building above three stories was badly damaged and everything in the warehouses was either stolen or destroyed. We need a ship to bring <cargo> to them as soon as possible, but there are no available Navy ships capable of doing the job. Would you deliver the supplies for us, Captain?"`
	"CN-4701" `	"I'd be glad to help, Officer."`
	"CN-4702" `	"Sorry, but I'm not traveling in that direction."`
	"CN-4703" `A captain in a Free Worlds uniform enters the spaceport and turns on a megaphone. "Attention! The Free Worlds are in need of volunteers able to carry <cargo> to <stopovers> for fortifying the spaceports nearest to the pirate system of Men. Free Worlds ships are currently preoccupied with fighting off a pirate incursion into those systems, and we are unable to spare enough ships for the job. Our hope is that these defenses will deter any future incursions. Payment will be <payment> for the first captain who accepts." The spaceport falls quiet as captains contemplate this offer.`
	"CN-4704" `	(Ignore.)`
	"CN-4705" `	The Free Worlds captain thanks you for offering your help. Spaceport workers load the turrets onto your ship, and the captain tells you to return to <origin> once you have dropped off the turrets for payment.`
	"CN-4706" `In the <origin> spaceport, you are approached by a Syndicate employee. By the looks of his uniform, he works for Syndicated Security. "Hello, Captain. You're a competent pilot, correct?" You nod your head. "Excellent. The Syndicate needs <cargo> transported to <destination>. The pirate world has seen a particularly bad harvest this past season, so much of the population is without sufficient food. Pirate warlords have threatened to begin raiding our freighters and frontier worlds if we don't provide them with food. It's cheaper to do what they want, so we've agreed to the deal, but we don't want to risk any of our own ships being destroyed. The Syndicate will pay you <payment> should you accept and complete this job."`
	"CN-4707" `	"Alright, I'll get my ship ready."`
	"CN-4708" `	"Sorry, but I have better things to be doing."`
	"CN-4709" `It is dusk at the <origin> spaceport, and the setting sun casts long shadows across the spaceport deck. You take notice of a slim cloaked figure walking only a few meters behind you who seems to be keeping pace.`
	"CN-4710" `	(Confront them.)`
	"CN-4711" `	(Stop walking and see if they stop as well.)`
	"CN-4712" `	You stop by the entrance to a store that claims to have "the best Polecats!" and lean against the building, trying not to draw attention to yourself. The figure keeps walking at the same pace, and as they pass you, a soft voice says, "Follow me," from under the cloak. The figure bolts off into a dark alleyway next to the building.`
	"CN-4713" `	You turn around and stare right at the figure, who stops within a foot of you. The shadows cast by the sun make it impossible for you to make out their face under the cloak. "Follow me," a soft voice says from under the cloak, before the figure bolts off into a dark alleyway next to the building.`
	"CN-4714" `	(Follow the figure.)`
	"CN-4715" `	You step into the alleyway and find the figure standing under a lamp. The figure removes their cloak, revealing the face of a woman with short dark hair and a distinct, jagged scar across her right cheek. She begins whispering to you. "You're not from this world. I can tell. You're too clean and unscarred. Could you help me?"`
	"CN-4716" `	"Why would I help a pirate?"`
	"CN-4717" `	The woman chuckles. "Not everyone who lives on a pirate world is a pirate, you know. Maybe you need to learn how not to stereotype. Regardless..." She trails off.`
	"CN-4718" `	"It isn't what I want, it's what I need," she whispers, putting heavy emphasis on the word "need."`
	"CN-4719" `	"You undoubtedly know about the horrendous slave trade that still exists on pirate worlds today. A slave trade that the Republic doesn't care to abolish, leaving innocent people to waste away like rats in a cage, working for their lives. As if the politicians of the Republic aren't vermin themselves..." Her face twists into a hate-filled scorn as she speaks of the Republic. It then returns to normal as she continues. "I'm part of a group of people who have decided to take matters into our own hands. We're mostly people who grew up on pirate worlds, but some of us were born elsewhere.`
	"CN-4720" `	"I assassinated a pirate warlord a couple of days ago, and I have been sheltering his slaves ever since. What I need from you is to transport the <bunks> people in my care to <destination>. Another member of my group should be there to pay you <payment> and take the people somewhere far away from here." She cocks her head to the right. "Will you fight for justice and transport these people, Captain?" The look in her eyes suggests that she won't take no for an answer.`
	"CN-4721" `	"Anything for the freedom of the innocent."`
	"CN-4722" `	"Sorry, but I'm not going to risk my life for your cause."`
	"CN-4723" `	"Good choice, Captain. We'll wait till the sun has fully set, then I will bring the people to your ship. I'll be traveling in my own ship and launch ahead of you, which should hopefully distract the pirates looking for their warlord's assassin and give you enough room to escape. Wait for me after you land on <planet>."`
	"CN-4724" `	"Poor choice, Captain." The woman pulls a knife from under her cloak and tilts it to blind you with the glare of the lamp above her. You stumble backward in anticipation of an attack, but the woman does not move. "I'll remember this, Captain," she hisses at you. The woman puts her cloak back up and sprints down the alleyway into darkness.`
	"CN-4725" `Just as was promised, a man approaches you in the spaceport and tells you that he is part of the same group as the woman. Interestingly, the man has a similar scar as the woman on his left cheek. "I'll make sure these people find a safe home somewhere far away from here," he says to you. After greeting each of your former passengers, he thanks you and pays you <payment>.`
	"CN-4726" `	You and the man, who does not give his name to you in order to "keep us both safe," wait for the woman to arrive in her own ship. Hours pass, but there is no sign of her. The man tries to contact her, but he is unable to reach her. "You can leave now," the man says to you. "I don't think she'll be coming."`
	"CN-4727" `As you step into a dive bar for a quick drink, the largest man you've ever seen stands up and blocks your path. He's well over two meters tall, and his muscles seem to ripple with barely restrained violence when he moves. "<first> <last>," he says in a thick accent. "My employer hears you do certain jobs, take money, do not ask questions. He hears you are reliable. A man, a smuggler, he steals cargo from my employer. My employer very much wants cargo returned, and this man as well."`
	"CN-4728" `	"I'm sorry, sir, but I'm not taking new jobs today. Please give your employer my most gracious thanks for this kind offer."`
	"CN-4729" `	"Of course. I won't say a word."`
	"CN-4730" `	"Get out of my way. I don't take jobs from any schlub who bothers me when I need a drink."`
	"CN-4731" `	The man looks down at you with no change in expression. "My employer, he will not be happy. I will tell him, '<first> <last> is not so reliable.' I hope next time, you are reliable." As the man speaks, you notice that his teeth are filed to vicious points. Every patron in the bar stares at you in shock as you sit down for a badly-needed drink.`
	"CN-4732" `	The man looks down at you with no change in expression. "This is good. To be reliable, it is a great thing on <origin>." As the man speaks, you notice that his teeth are filed to vicious points. He holds out a round, flat object about the size of your palm. It has a recessed button in the center of one side. "This is gift for this smuggler. Press button, it becomes surprise. Make sure surprise is not on you." He hands you the object and a data chip containing details of the job. As the man leaves, you see every patron in the bar staring warily at his back.`
	"CN-4733" `	The man looks down at you with no change in expression. "This is great shame. I will tell my employer, '<first> <last> was not so reliable. I had to make example.'" The man grabs your neck with one monstrous hand. The last thing you see as your vision fades to black is a mouth full of pointed teeth.`
	"CN-4734" `The smuggler and his crew are ready and waiting when you board. You pull out the "gift" and press the button, then quickly toss it down the hallway. For a moment, you meet the smuggler's eyes. They widen with terror when he sees the "gift." You duck back into cover. A few seconds later, you hear a strangely muted detonation, followed by silence. After a minute, you hazard another peek out of cover. The smuggler and all his men are unconscious on the ground. One crewman has blood dripping from his nose and ears. You tie them all up and stow the smuggler in a locked cabin on your ship.`
	"CN-4735" `	Once they're secured, you sweep the ship. Ultimately you find the stolen cargo in the captain's cabin, hidden behind a false panel. The cargo is a nondescript storage container, but upon closer inspection you see that it's code-locked and covered with Interference Plating.`
	"CN-4736" `The huge man drags the unconscious smuggler out of the cargo container with one hand and carries the cargo box with the other. He stops in front of you. "<first> <last>," he says. "My employer, he will be very happy. Your payment, you will receive soon. Is it not good, to be reliable?" The man leaves your ship, letting the smuggler's legs scrape along the ground as he walks. A moment later, you receive <payment> from an anonymous account.`
	"CN-4737" `You are walking near the spaceport and suddenly a computer terminal starts blinking and beeping when you pass it.`
	"CN-4738" `When you approach, you are greeted by a voice from the terminal: "Dear Sir or Madam, please respond!"`
	"CN-4739" `	"Hello!"`
	"CN-4740" `	(Ignore it and walk away.)`
	"CN-4741" `	"My name is Mr. Smith and I'm contacting you with a highly confidential and urgent proposal. I am, or more accurately was, the financial manager of the recently deceased warlord Limping Pappa. I am looking for a highly trustworthy individual who can help me relocate Mr. Pappa's fortune of 300 million credits."`
	"CN-4742" `	"How did Mr. Pappa acquire his fortune exactly?"`
	"CN-4743" `	"What are you proposing?"`
	"CN-4744" `	"This sounds like a credits-stealing scam, I will not fall for this!"`
	"CN-4745" `	"Oh, uh, Mr. Pappa was specialized into tricking rich victims to transfer credits to him.`
	"CN-4746" `	"I obviously cannot make myself an heir to Mr. Pappa. So what I propose is to present you as an heir and have the inheritance transferred to you.`
	"CN-4747" `	"When you receive the inheritance on <destination>, then you send half of it back to me."`
	"CN-4748" `	"Okay, let's do this."`
	"CN-4749" `	"Sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?"`
	"CN-4750" `	"Sorry, this sounds too fishy for me."`
	"CN-4751" `	Mr. Smith responds: "There is one small problem with the inheritance tax, it needs to be paid upfront. Can you pay 200,000 credits so that I can get the process going?"`
	"CN-4752" `	"Are you trying to trick me?"`
	"CN-4753" `	"Sounds too risky, I don't want to pay anything upfront."`
	"CN-4754" `	"Of course I'm not trying to trick you! Mr. Pappa's victims were all persons that had more credits than common sense. But you look a lot smarter than any of Mr. Pappa's victims.`
	"CN-4755" `	"Think of the huge amount of credits you will receive just for acting as heir! Can I count on you to pay the tax and make both of us very wealthy?"`
	"CN-4756" `	The terminal suddenly goes black after you transfer 200,000 credits to the account given by Mr. Smith.`
	"CN-4757" `	You wonder if you did the right thing.`
	"CN-4758" `	The terminal suddenly goes black. Mr. Smith is apparently no longer interested in doing business with you.`
	"CN-4759" `A lady in a formal business suit walks gracefully over to you. "Captain <last>, Captain <last>! It is so nice to meet you here!"`
	"CN-4760" `	"Hello, did we meet before? How do you know my name?"`
	"CN-4761" `	"Hello, nice to meet you too."`
	"CN-4762" `	"Sorry, I don't have time to talk. I'm really busy."`
	"CN-4763" `	She smiles and replies, "Well, I actually don't know you, but I just read your name on one of the cargo manifests. And my experience is that this greeting works best if you need something from a spaceship captain."`
	"CN-4764" `	She says, "My name is Veronica Oxygenpocket, and I'm the lead for a team that's designing the new Hauler VI transport ship series at Southbound Shipyards."`
	"CN-4765" `	"'Oxygenpocket' is an uncommon name."`
	"CN-4766" `	"And what help do you need from me?"`
	"CN-4767" `	Veronica responds, "Well, it might sound uncommon to people from a planet with a breathable atmosphere, but it is actually similar to Vanderberg, which means 'from the mountain,' or Langley, which means 'woodland.'`
	"CN-4768" `	"Oxygenpockets were as much a feature on my home-planet as mountains and woodlands are on more habitable planets."`
	"CN-4769" `	Veronica pauses for a moment and then continues, "We're testing the VI's cargo refrigeration system using the Testament, a modified Hauler III. This system is one of our biggest achievements. To show how well it works, we plan to throw a formal dinner on <destination> with fresh sushi transported from here. I'm sure everyone at the dinner will be amazed by how well the food has been preserved despite the travel time. I'd like you to escort the ship and its cargo to <planet>."`
	"CN-4770" `	"Isn't it a bit risky to transport food using a refrigeration system that hasn't been tested yet?"`
	"CN-4771" `	"Am I also invited for the dinner?"`
	"CN-4772" `	"Why do you need me to escort the ship?"`
	"CN-4773" `	"Shouldn't you be making the Hauler IV first?"`
	"CN-4774" `	"Sure, I'll help you."`
	"CN-4775" `	Veronica softly chuckles. "That would be the obvious choice, wouldn't it be? But this isn't just a case of slapping another cargo pod between the cockpit and engines. We've modified the design to have the optimal amount of cargo pods without compromising the integrity of the vessel, or making it difficult to build in our existing shipyards. And besides, our marketing department has found that captains willing to buy a Hauler IV are just as willing to buy larger Haulers."`
	"CN-4776" `	"Risky, why? I don't see what can go wrong. The system is quite well designed. I'm so proud of my team."`
	"CN-4777" `	"I'm sorry, but you are not invited. This dinner is only for Southbound Shipyards top-level management and representatives of the <planet> government.`
	"CN-4778" `	"Normally we'd look internally to satisfy any escort needs, that's true. But we suspect there is a mole in our organization spying for Syndicated Shipyards. Going externally is safer in this case, and you came recommended when we searched through the list of captains available on short notice. You will be paid well for your time. Will you help us?"`
	"CN-4779" `You wait for the Testament to land, but it remains in orbit. There is no response to your hails. Maybe you should take off and investigate.`
	"CN-4780" `You take off and try to contact Veronica, but you receive an angry message: "Why were you trying to contact me? Does everyone need to know that we're here?"`
	"CN-4781" `	She adds, "The cooling failed and the sushi nearly cooked. Let's go to the Southbound Shipyards on <destination> instead, then we can save face by claiming that we were in time for the dinner, but on the wrong planet due to some miscommunication. We might even be able to hide all evidence of the overheating by giving away the sushi as fish dishes on a streetfood festival."`
	"CN-4782" `This time the Testament appears to be landing right behind you, but the ship flies away at full thrust just before touching the landing pad. You receive another message: "The Sushi completely burned. We cannot be seen near the festival or near the shipyard with this burned sushi! Our new destination is the waste processing plant at Longjump."`
	"CN-4783" `The Testament enters the planet's atmosphere at high speed and lands somewhat uncontrolled near a waste processing plant. The cargo hold is glowing red hot and some areas in the cargo hold appear to be on fire.`
	"CN-4784" `	Veronica disembarks, walks over to you, and apologizes for the difficult trip. She explains that the cooling systems failed, causing the sushi calamity you experienced during the multiple legs of your journey.`
	"CN-4785" `	You are paid <payment> and she asks you not to talk about this escort job to anybody. You leave the docks quickly in order to escape the horrible smell of overheated fish that is coming from Veronica and her ship.`
	"CN-4786" `As you wander around the spaceport, you spot a well-dressed man who seems to be eyeing your ship. When you approach him, he turns to you and asks, "Is this your ship? I'm looking for someone in charge of a heavily armed fleet."`
	"CN-4787" `	"It is. Why?"`
	"CN-4788" `	"Sorry, I think you're mistaken."`
	"CN-4789" `	The man begins to explain himself. "I'm arranging a shipment from a pharmaceutical plant here on <origin> to <destination>. Specifically, <cargo>. I'm sure you're aware of the fact that they're in very high demand in the south, so we have a trade deal with that planet. Unfortunately, <commodity> are in even higher demand in pirate territory, so the last two merchants I've sent down there have been attacked by pirate ships. My company won't give the budget for an escort, so anyone I send down there has to be alone. Fortunately, I do have the budget for a high-risk contract, so if you can take one of these shipments to <destination>, I can arrange a payment of <payment>. Does this sound fair so far?"`
	"CN-4790" `	"Sure, but do you know anything about these pirates?"`
	"CN-4791" `	"No thanks, that sounds too risky for me."`
	"CN-4792" `	He seems to have anticipated this question, and quickly responds by saying "Oh, it's mostly just opportunistic raiders, much like the ones you've probably already seen a lot of down there. Pretty sure a ship like this one will make those guys hesitant enough. The problem is a modified medium warship called the <npc>. It's faster than a Bounder and persistent beyond any reasonable measure. Which is, of course, why I'm talking to you. There is no way you're going to avoid a fight with it. However, I think your ship is a match for it. So, is this acceptable?"`
	"CN-4793" `	"No thanks, that sounds like too much of a risk."`
	"CN-4794" `	"Thank you very much, Captain," he says. "I'll take care of everything else from here."`
	"CN-4795" `While you are walking around the spaceport, you accidentally bump into a sturdily-built man. "Oh, I'm sorry," he responds in a gruff voice. When he takes a closer look at you, his expression changes to shock. "Oh! You're Captain <last>!"`
	"CN-4796" `	"How did you know my name?"`
	"CN-4797" `	"I don't know who you're talking about."`
	"CN-4798" `	The man's expression changes to one of slight disappointment. "Oh. I see." He walks away without another word.`
	"CN-4799" `	"I happen to take an interest in young pioneering privateers, and your performance, even in a small vessel like the <ship>, has impressed me greatly. I'll tell you more if you let me take you somewhere."`
	"CN-4800" `	"Sure, I'll follow."`
	"CN-4801" `	"Where are you taking me?"`
	"CN-4802" `	The man chuckles nervously. "Just to somewhere more private. Don't worry, I won't bite."`
	"CN-4803" `	"Fine, I'll go."`
	"CN-4804" `	"I still don't buy this. I'm out."`
	"CN-4805" `	You follow the man into a series of winding alleyways, keeping your eyes alert for any danger. After a while, the man stops. "I suppose I can tell you more about myself now. I... am the leader of the local militia, and I believe that, considering your proficiency in piloting smaller craft, you would be a great candidate to join our team. However, there is a test you must pass. I will use one of our smaller ships in our fleet, the Esca, to challenge you to a duel in the system of Umbral. If you manage to disable me, go to our base in Wayfarer, and I'll let you join."`
	"CN-4806" `	"What sort of vessel is the Esca?"`
	"CN-4807" `	"Why did you need to bring me to here? Couldn't you have made this offer in the spaceport?"`
	"CN-4808" `	The man hesitates for a moment. "Well, being in the open when admitting that you're the leader of the ragtag that hunts down pirates in a potentially pirate-infested spaceport isn't a good idea. You can't ever be too sure about who's listening.`
	"CN-4809" `	The man hesitates for a moment. "Oh, just some low-end Southbound Shipyards light warship. Nothing to worry about for a captain like you.`
	"CN-4810" `	"Well, I better be going now. Meet me at Umbral as fast as you can if you want to take up my challenge." The man walks away, leaving you to your own devices.`
	"CN-4811" `	(Ready my ship for the battle with the Esca.)`
	"CN-4812" `	(Ignore the invitation.)`
	"CN-4813" `When you enter Umbral, you continue to see no sign of the Esca. Suddenly, an alarm rings out as your sensors detect that a pirate Vanguard has entered the system alongside you. Before you can respond, your ship intercepts a hail, and it opens communication.`
	"CN-4814" `	The voice of the alleged captain of the Esca shouts out towards you. "Ho ho ho! Did you really think that I was the leader of the militia? Well, considering that you're here, I suppose you did. And now you'll pay for your mistake! Don't bother trying to call for help either, the militia don't patrol this system!"`
	"CN-4815" `	The Vanguard powers up its weapons.`
	"CN-4816" `You enter Umbral, but see no sign of the Esca, as the "captain of the Esca" was killed. You should head back to Wayfarer to see if you can claim some sort of reward.`
	"CN-4817" `You enter Umbral, but see no sign of the Esca, as the "captain of the Esca" was on the ship you disabled. You should head back to make sure the Anglerfish has been fully destroyed.`
	"CN-4818" `As you enter Umbral, the Anglerfish follows behind you, and opens a hail.`
	"CN-4819" `	"Did you think that if you went to Umbral, I would switch to a smaller ship? Ha!"`
	"CN-4820" `	The Anglerfish once again powers up its weapons.`
	"CN-4821" `As soon as you open fire, the Anglerfish hails you.`
	"CN-4822" `	A voice you recognize as the "captain of the Esca" says, "How did you know that was me? Well, it doesn't matter, because I've paid off the militia. Get ready to die, small-fry."`
	"CN-4823" `	The Anglerfish powers up its weapons.`
	"CN-4824" `The Anglerfish and the "captain of the Esca" have been destroyed. You should continue on to Wayfarer to see if you can claim some sort of reward for your effort.`
	"CN-4825" `The Anglerfish and the "captain of the Esca" have been destroyed. You should head back to Wayfarer to see if you can claim some sort of reward for your effort.`
	"CN-4826" `The Anglerfish and the "captain of the Esca" have been destroyed. You should land on Wayfarer to see if you can claim some sort of reward for your effort.`
	"CN-4827" `When you land on Wayfarer, you look up bounties and wanted pirate documents, searching for any mention of the Anglerfish and the Esca. Eventually, you find a bounty for the destruction of the Anglerfish.`
	"CN-4828" `	(Take the bounty money.)`
	"CN-4829" `	(Read more about the bounty.)`
	"CN-4830" `	You decide to read more of the bounty documents. It appears that the pirate that you killed was Enrico Snake, a pirate that mainly dealt in cargo smuggling. However, he also had a curious tick of hunting aspiring privateers by luring them to Umbral, where he easily took them out with his superior ship.`
	"CN-4831" `	You head to the local authorities, and show them your combat logs of your fight against the Anglerfish. They pay you <payment> for your effort.`
	"CN-4832" `As you wander through the spaceport, you see an elderly man and woman sitting on a bench, talking about something that seems to be causing them some amount of stress.`
	"CN-4833" `	(Ask them what the problem is.)`
	"CN-4834" `	You inquire as to what's troubling them, and the woman begins telling you her life's story. "We were yard workers here on <origin> for nearly fifty years, but we're both starting to get too old for our jobs. So, we've made the hard decision to retire. We've already chosen a location on the best place we could afford, which... well, happened to be on Earth, so Charles and I are looking for someone to transport us. Oh, where are my manners? I'm Donna. Pleased to meet you."`
	"CN-4835" `	Donna was clearly looking for someone besides her husband to talk to, but Charles begins to frown. "I suppose you could put it like that."`
	"CN-4836" `	"Is that wrong?" Donna replies anxiously, bracing for the response.`
	"CN-4837" `	The man's look of resignation starts to turn to one of anger. "Of course it's wrong. We've spent our whole lives working for these spoiled brats, and what do we get in return? We get dumped on Earth like we're dead weight!"`
	"CN-4838" `	"I know you're upset about this," interrupts Donna, "but just getting angry isn't going to change anything!" Charles remains silent for a long time, and then mutters a reluctant apology.`
	"CN-4839" `	Donna talks to you again. "I'm sorry about that. As you can tell, we're under a lot of stress right now. I can tell that you're a star captain. Can you help take us to Earth? We don't have a lot of money, but we'll be glad to pay <payment>."`
	"CN-4840" `	"I can handle two passengers."`
	"CN-4841" `	"I'm sorry, but I'm not headed to Earth right now."`
	"CN-4842" `	You show Charles and Donna to their bunks, and they both thank you in advance.`
	"CN-4843" `Once you land on Earth, Donna and Charles pick up their belongings and start to leave your ship. Before he leaves, Charles stops and takes out a large clump of credit chips. "Here you go," he mutters. "I hope your life goes better than ours has."`
	"CN-4844" `	"Thank you. I hope you have the best of luck on Earth."`
	"CN-4845" `	"You can keep those. You sound like you need them more than I do."`
	"CN-4846" `	As you count up the large clump of credits you were handed (the sum comes out to the expected <payment>), they slowly make their way to the train station. Presumably, their new apartment is far from here.`
	"CN-4847" `	Charles looks surprised for a moment, and then, for the first time you've seen, he smiles. "Thank you, Captain <last>. I wish there were more people like you in the Paradise Worlds."`
	"CN-4848" `	You wish the couple the best of luck on Earth, and they slowly make their way to the train station. Presumably, their new apartment is far from here.`
	"CN-4849" `	A young man carrying luggage approaches you. "You look like a knowledgeable captain," he says. "In all your travels, have you ever heard tell of any... intelligent rodents?"`
	"CN-4850" `	"What are you talking about?"`
	"CN-4851" `	"What, like in a zoo?"`
	"CN-4852" `	"Are you high?"`
	"CN-4853" `	"No, I want to go to the high-" He stops once he realizes you have no idea what he's talking about. "Oh, never mind then," he says, with a note of disappointment in his voice. As he leaves, you can't help feeling like you were missing some context.`
	"CN-4854" `	"Oh, never mind then," he says, with a note of disappointment in his voice. As he leaves, you can't help feeling like you were missing some context.`
	"CN-4855" `	"'Heard tell'? I'm from Hai space!"`
	"CN-4856" `	"You mean the Hai? You'll have to go up north for that."`
	"CN-4857" `	"Ah, I think I know of some large squirrels to the north of here."`
	"CN-4858" `	"Oh, never mind then," he says, with a note of disappointment in his voice. You feel good knowing that you are helping to keep the Hai's existence a secret in human space. Better safe than sorry.`
	"CN-4859" `	He seems shocked. "Really? I can give you <payment> to get to <planet>."`
	"CN-4860" `	"If that's the case, could you bring me to <destination>? I'll give you <payment>."`
	"CN-4861" `	"Actually, I'm from <planet>."`
	"CN-4862" `	"Alright, I'll take you there."`
	"CN-4863" `	"Sorry, I'm too busy right now."`
	"CN-4864" `	"Why would you want to go all the way out to <planet>?"`
	"CN-4865" `	"No way, you as well?" He stops for a second to process. "They say the universe is a small place, but I never believed any of that. Until now, that is. And to think I'd meet someone like you on my first time out of the wormhole."`
	"CN-4866" `	"I have family there," he says. "I came out here to do some traveling and see a bit of human space, but now I have to get back home. You see, I was born on <planet>, and this is my first time out of the wormhole."`
	"CN-4867" `	"Really? How did you like human space?"`
	"CN-4868" `	"You've never been to human space before?"`
	"CN-4869" `	"Nope, first time! I've never been so far from home before. Now that I think about it, I probably should've arranged transport back to Hai space beforehand. You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find a captain here that knows about the Hai. I had to ask about six others until I found you. They all thought I was crazy, talking about meeting giant squirrels." He laughs and shakes his head. "So anyways, would you be willing to take me to <destination>?"`
	"CN-4870" `	"It was quite the trip! It's a bit odd to see only humans around, and I had to be careful to not mention where I was from. But it was definitely worth it! I got to see Earth, Skymoot, Chiron, and so many other beautiful planets. Seeing human culture with my own eyes was an eye-opening experience, although some of the places there were less... clean than I expected. I was almost robbed on Earth; I'm not used to pickpockets back home. Perhaps human space isn't as safe as Hai space, but I still don't regret coming here. It's about time for me to go back, though."`
	"CN-4871" `During the trip, you learn that your passenger is named Benjamin. He gets off your ship, thanks you, and gives you your payment of <payment>. Benjamin then walks over to greet a group of Hai, who embrace him and start talking in a mix of the human and Hai languages.`
	"CN-4872" `	"That's your family?"`
	"CN-4873" `	The man looks at you. "I'm adopted," he says. One of the Hai notices your confusion, and chitters. "Ah, you have not seen a human-Hai family, have you? Perhaps it is strange, but we are happy together nonetheless. Thank you for transporting our son safely."`
	"CN-4874" `	"I didn't mean to be rude, I just didn't know that Hai adopted humans here."`
	"CN-4875" `	"No problem, I hope you enjoyed the trip."`
	"CN-4876" `	After thanking you once again, they walk off. As they leave, you overhear Benjamin talk to his family about his trip. "They had so many kinds of food there, it was delicious! Although I did get homesick for pickled acorns..."`
	"CN-4877" `	Benjamin notices you approaching, and says, "These are my parents, Yeerto and Taepip." His father Yeerto then says, "We checked the travel agencies here on Greenwater, but it turned out to be much cheaper to get a merchant to bring Benjamin to human space. I guess we learned why that was cheaper the hard way."`
	"CN-4878" `	"You said you used to work at a travel agency, right?" Benjamin adds with a smile on his face. "Funny we almost found each other then."`
	"CN-4879" `	Benjamin's mother Taepip softly places her hand on his shoulder before continuing, "If you want, you could come to our home and have a chat. And some pickled acorns, too," she adds with a bright smile.`
	"CN-4880" `	"Sorry, I have other pressing matters."`
	"CN-4881" `	You spend a long evening with them, talking about your upbringing on <planet> and your experiences in human space. Yeerto then tells you about the local news here, and you catch up with what's happened on your home planet since you left.`
	"CN-4882" `	It begins to get dark, and after a final goodbye you head back to your ship.`
	"CN-4883" `A man in a tailored suit, sunglasses, shiny shoes, and green hair approaches you. "Hey, that's a very nice ship you have there. Would be a shame if anything happened to it."`
	"CN-4884" `	You notice that he is missing a finger on each hand.`
	"CN-4885" `	"Thank you. My name is <first> <last>. To whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?"`
	"CN-4886" `	"Yes, I'm very happy with my ship."`
	"CN-4887" `	"What should I be afraid of happening to my ship?"`
	"CN-4888" `	"You sound like one of those Mafia goons."`
	"CN-4889" `	"Are you trying to extort me?"`
	"CN-4890" `	"Yes, it helps me transport goods for some of the most dangerous people on this planet."`
	"CN-4891" `	"I don't have time to talk."`
	"CN-4892" `	The man snorts. "Wow, telling everybody you meet your full name. That totally won't end up painting a huge target on your head if said name has a bounty on it. But I digress."`
	"CN-4893" `	"You sound like one of those mafia goons."`
	"CN-4894" `	The man responds, "Well, a fleet of unfriendly ships in this system might blow you to pieces when you take off. It's been known to happen from time to time."`
	"CN-4895" `	"Ha, business as usual around here."`
	"CN-4896" `	"And you have a way to prevent this from happening?"`
	"CN-4897" `	"And you're the local goon who takes bribes to keep such ships docked?"`
	"CN-4898" `	"That would be unfortunate. I run jobs for some of the most dangerous people on this planet, and they wouldn't be happy if that happened."`
	"CN-4899" `	"I really don't have time to talk to you."`
	"CN-4900" `	The man responds, "Maybe you want to improve that situation?`
	"CN-4901" `	The man acts shocked by your remark. "No way! I'm just a simple man walking around the spaceport and helping people out. You would be wise to listen to locals with experience, especially in dangerous places like this."`
	"CN-4902" `	"If you care about safety, then I could make a donation to the System Safety Foundation on your behalf. 200,000 credits really goes a long way around here."`
	"CN-4903" `	(Pay 200,000 credits.)`
	"CN-4904" `	"How can I be sure the money is spent well?"`
	"CN-4905" `	"Sorry, I already made a donation to the 'Security Support Fund' earlier today, and I don't donate twice in one day."`
	"CN-4906" `	"I've already heard enough, I'm going to talk to the authorities."`
	"CN-4907" `	"And what dangers should I be afraid of?"`
	"CN-4908" `	"Listen, I see that you're missing a finger on each hand. You look like a goon, and not a very successful one."`
	"CN-4909" `	The man sounds annoyed. "Listen, I don't have all day to talk! Are you going to pay or not?!"`
	"CN-4910" `	"I don't trust you. You aren't getting any money from me."`
	"CN-4911" `	"I've heard enough, I'm going to talk to the authorities."`
	"CN-4912" `	The man responds "Your funeral, not mine," and turns away from you.`
	"CN-4913" `	"Look, that's not a smart move. Most of them are in on it anyway."`
	"CN-4914" `	The man walks away. You consider what to do next.`
	"CN-4915" `	(Shrug off the whole thing and take no further action.)`
	"CN-4916" `	(Find the closest thing to a police force that this planet has.)`
	"CN-4917" `	(Go to a bar and ask for whoever is in charge.)`
	"CN-4918" `	It's not long before you find the ruins of what used to be a police station... you think. The building has been thoroughly destroyed, hopefully not while anybody was inside.`
	"CN-4919" `	You walk towards the closest bar, but stumble into the green-haired man that you just had a conversation with.`
	"CN-4920" `	He looks surprised and asks, "Were you going to rat me out to the local boss?"`
	"CN-4921" `	"What an excellent idea! Yes, I'll just do that."`
	"CN-4922" `	"What I'm going to do is none of your business."`
	"CN-4923" `	"Don't worry, I'm just taking a walk."`
	"CN-4924" `	The man is starting to act a bit nervous. "Sorry I bothered you. Can we forget this happened?"`
	"CN-4925" `	"Well, conversations like this are hard to forget."`
	"CN-4926" `	"Nice scam you have running here. Would be a shame if somebody told the local godfather about it."`
	"CN-4927" `	(Agree.)`
	"CN-4928" `	"Well, what do you want? Do I have to do something for you?"`
	"CN-4929" `	"No, let's just forget it happened."`
	"CN-4930" `	"Compensation for the time that you've wasted would be excellent."`
	"CN-4931" `	A bead of sweat travels down the man's face as he asks, "How many credits do you need to just forget this whole conversation happened?"`
	"CN-4932" `	"100,000,000."`
	"CN-4933" `	"1,000,000."`
	"CN-4934" `	"200,000."`
	"CN-4935" `	"50,000."`
	"CN-4936" `	"5,000."`
	"CN-4937" `	"2,000."`
	"CN-4938" `	"1,000."`
	"CN-4939" `	"I don't need your credits, just forget it."`
	"CN-4940" `	The man walks away without saying a word.`
	"CN-4941" `	"That's too much! 2,389 credits is all I have. Would that be enough?"`
	"CN-4942" `	"No way, I want a lot more."`
	"CN-4943" `	The man hands you a credit chip, nods and walks away. You pocket the chip quickly, more ready to be done with this neighborhood than you want to visibly show.`
	"CN-4944" `	A few minutes later you reach into your pocket for the chip... to find it missing. Looks like even a hardened captain like you isn't immune to being pickpocketed on a planet like this.`
	"CN-4945" `	The man starts panicking and clumsily reaches into his jacket, maybe to get some money, but more likely reaching for a gun.`
	"CN-4946" `	(Try to calm down the man.)`
	"CN-4947" `	(Mock the man further.)`
	"CN-4948" `	(Draw my sidearm and shoot the man.)`
	"CN-4949" `	The man manages to draw a weapon! You brace for impact, but after a few seconds of waiting, you realize his weapon is only making a clicking sound when he tries to shoot.`
	"CN-4950" `	"Ha, ha, you really are a failure of a goon."`
	"CN-4951" `	As you finish talking, you see a flash of light come from the muzzle of the man's weapon as a bullet hits you between the eyes. You die almost instantly, but you do have a few microseconds to reflect on the wisdom of mocking a man that is trying to fire a gun at you.`
	"CN-4952" `	Your bullet hits the man right between the eyes; he dies instantly, and a crowd starts to form around you.`
	"CN-4953" `	Most bystanders are surprised, but you also notice an angry sentiment brewing in the (not unarmed) crowd. It might be wise to leave quickly.`
	"CN-4954" `	(Run towards my ship and leave immediately.)`
	"CN-4955" `	(Put away my sidearm and pretend nothing happened.)`
	"CN-4956" `	You walk away nonchalantly, but you don't get far before multiple laser blasts slice through you.`
	"CN-4957" `	You make it to your ship alive and depart under a rain of bullets and laser-weapons fire. This is a pirate planet so there are unlikely to be any lasting consequences, but you might want to stay away for a few days.`
	"CN-4958" `	The man takes your credits, responds with a brief "Thank you," and walks away.`
	"CN-4959" `You see a small crowd beginning to gather on a street corner. A man in a flamboyant striped suit and matching hat calls, "Come here! Come here! Come see the marvelous magician Mistress Marionette corral the crowded crossroads with her extravagant schemes!"`
	"CN-4960" `	You join them. A woman in similarly fancy garb sits behind a table, swiftly shuffling three cups before a hulking man. The announcer continues, "For our new guests, the chosen challenger's chance approaches! The current buy-in bet was 7000 credits; yes, we play with the big money here! Double or nothing, bet your bet: are you a player or a puppet?"`
	"CN-4961" `	The cups stop. After a brief pause, the man points to the cup on the right.`
	"CN-4962" `	(Watch what happens.)`
	"CN-4963" `	"You know these things are scams, right?"`
	"CN-4964" `	You try to warn him, but someone in the crowd shushes you. He doesn't hear.`
	"CN-4965" `	"Are you certain in your choice?" the magician asks. "Once you-"`
	"CN-4966" `	"Yes, I'm certain," the man interrupts. He draws 7000 credits and tosses them on the table. The magician lifts the cup, and a small red ball rolls from beneath. "And the first challenger proves to be a player!" the announcer says, mustering enthusiasm as the magician counts 14,000 credits to pay the man. "Let us find a new challenger! The next buy-in is a mere 400 credits; if you haven't played before, now's the time to test your skill!"`
	"CN-4967" `	"I'd like to give it a try." (Bet 400 credits.)`
	"CN-4968" `	(Wait and watch.)`
	"CN-4969" `	(Walk away.)`
	"CN-4970" `	A short woman volunteers. The game progresses in a similar manner; by the end, you are certain the ball is underneath the center cup. Sure enough, the woman chooses that cup, and she walks away 400 credits richer.`
	"CN-4971" `	"The next buy-in is a larger prize!" the announcer calls after her before turning to address the crowd. "Six thousand credits, only for the proudest of players." The magician shakes her head softly, frowning at the cups.`
	"CN-4972" `	"I'll do it!" (Bet 6000 credits.)`
	"CN-4973" `	You pay 400 credits and sit across from the magician. "Double or nothing, bet your bet!" the announcer repeats. "Are you a player or a puppet?"`
	"CN-4974" `	The magician places the ball beneath the center and begins moving the cups. This one seems faster, but that might just be from the pressure. You keep your eyes trained on the cup as it shifts back and forth, around in circles, and occasionally remains untouched. By the end, you're pretty sure it's in the center cup.`
	"CN-4975" `	"What's your choice?" the magician asks, smirking.`
	"CN-4976" `	"Left."`
	"CN-4977" `	"Center."`
	"CN-4978" `	"Right."`
	"CN-4979" `	"Better luck next time," she says as she reveals your incorrect choice. The ball was in the center; you feel silly for not going with your gut.`
	"CN-4980" `	"The next buy-in is a larger prize!" the announcer calls. "Six thousand credits, reserved for the most daring. As the previous player, you have first priority."`
	"CN-4981" `	"Let's go again."`
	"CN-4982" `	"I think I'm done."`
	"CN-4983" `	She asks if you're sure, and you stick with your gut. With a grimace, she lifts the cup to reveal the ball and counts out your winnings. "And the player prevails!" the announcer says. "Earning a small bounty. But wait: the next buy-in is bigger yet! Six thousand credits, reserved for the most daring. As the previous player, you have first priority."`
	"CN-4984" `	You place your 6000 credit bet on the table, and the game begins. The pattern is slightly longer, but once the magician's hands stop, you feel like the ball lies beneath the left cup.`
	"CN-4985" `	With a grin, she reveals the left cup, and it's... wrong! "Nice try," she says, pocketing your money. "It is a bit tricky."`
	"CN-4986" `	"Well, that's all for today, folks!" the announcer says as you realize you've been conned. Worse still, after they pack up and leave, you notice that the first winner walks away beside them.`
	"CN-4987" `	With a raised eyebrow, she reveals the center cup. It's... wrong! "Nice try," she says, pocketing your money. "That one was a bit tricky."`
	"CN-4988" `	"Well, that's all for today, folks!" the announcer says. As they pack up and leave, you notice that the first winner walks away beside them.`
	"CN-4989" `	With a raised eyebrow, she reveals the right cup. It's... wrong! "Nice try," she says, pocketing your money. "That one was a bit tricky."`
	"CN-4990" `	Sensing that something's up, you decide to watch the next game. A sprightly young fellow confidently hands over 6000 credits; when the cups stop, you feel like the ball is under the left one. The boy points to it; with a grin, the magician reveals the left cup, and it's... wrong! "Nice try," she says, pocketing the shocked boy's money. "It is a bit tricky."`
	"CN-4991" `	"Well, that's all for today, folks!" the announcer says. You're glad you avoided the con. As they pack up and leave, you notice that the first winner walks away beside them.`
	"CN-4992" `By the edge of the spaceport at night, you see a thin, sweaty man turn away from a pilot, disheartened. You make eye contact, and he begins hurrying over to you.`
	"CN-4993" `	(Wait for him.)`
	"CN-4994" `	(Walk away quickly.)`
	"CN-4995" `	"Excuse me! Are you a pilot?" Without waiting for a response, he continues, "I need to go to the Syndicate. I work all day picking cotton with these hands, but my family's still starving. We can't afford transport..."`
	"CN-4996" `	You can barely understand him through his accent. The man's teeth look worse than his clothes, and his breath makes you step back. His eyes implore you.`
	"CN-4997" `	"I might be able to help you. What planet do you need to reach?"`
	"CN-4998" `	"I'm sorry, I only transport for pay."`
	"CN-4999" `	His eyes brighten with hope. "Oh! I, I heard some people are going to <planet> to be miners. They hire folk like us. I, if you could get me, and my wife and our two sons there, I'd praise you to the high stars. You'd save our lives."`
	"CN-5000" `	"I can take you, but no more."`
	"CN-5001" `	"I'd be happy to offer you four transport."`
	"CN-5002" `	"Sorry, I think this won't work out."`
	"CN-5003" `	"The two little ones are really small," he persists. "We can cramp together. You'll just notice two of us. I mean, some go themselves and send money back, but..."`
	"CN-5004" `	He shakes his head. "My wife's already told me we need to stay together, and I agree. I can't leave. Please, nobody else has said yes."`
	"CN-5005" `	"I guess I can find room."`
	"CN-5006" `	"Sorry, but that's still too many. Have a nice day."`
	"CN-5007" `	"Oh, thank you, thank you!" he says, vigorously shaking your hand. "I'll get them fast, we can leave tonight! I'm Gaint, by the way." He quickly leaves to get them, turning back at least three times to tip his hat to you and make sure you haven't left.`
	"CN-5008" `	Gaint's family arrives quickly. His wife, Mell, is carrying their infant child, and a toddler clutches her leg. His fingers look like a skeleton, and his eyes look like his dad's. "Thank you so much," Mell says as they enter your ship.`
	"CN-5009" `	You fend off a few more pleas before he understands it's hopeless and begins looking for someone else.`
	"CN-5010" `	As your ship enters <planet>'s cavernous spaceport, you can sense a mixture of hope and apprehension in Gaint and Mell. "Andrin talks too much," you overhear Gaint saying. "I didn't know it's all underground."`
	"CN-5011" `	"We'll figure it out," Mell assures him. When they notice you're listening in, the conversation stops. Your ship lands, and the family collects their things to leave. They thank you again on their way out.`
	"CN-5012" `As soon as you touch down on <origin>, you step off your ship and head directly for the job board and trade hub, brushing past several locals on the way. The constant routine of interstellar commerce has been firmly drilled into your brain; you near unconsciously peruse the boards, trying to suss out the most profitable route.`
	"CN-5013" `	You're caught off guard when you hear a voice behind you. "Hey, what's with all the rush, Captain?" You turn and see a dark-haired man in a faded green longcoat approaching you. "You seem awfully focused on getting off-world as soon as possible. Why not take a moment to look around? Admire the sights, try the local cuisine, maybe even talk to some of the people."`
	"CN-5014" `	"Why should I do that?"`
	"CN-5015" `	"I'm a spaceship captain; I don't have time to waste."`
	"CN-5016" `	"Yes, I know already. I'll take my time later."`
	"CN-5017" `	He tilts his head to the side. "You know, I'm a captain too. I know how quickly the luster of the galaxy can fade into the weekly grind if you wait for opportunity to come knocking. So why keep waiting? I'm sure you'll find something new to do in the spaceport."`
	"CN-5018" `	"I'll be sure to check more spaceports in the future."`
	"CN-5019" `	"Nothing interesting happened the last time I checked a spaceport."`
	"CN-5020" `	"Why should I listen to you? I can handle myself, thank you very much."`
	"CN-5021" `	The captain sighs. "Yeah, it can feel a little pointless running up against the same loud-mouthed people all the time. But just because a spaceport doesn't have anything to offer one day doesn't mean that it'll never have anything worthwhile. Wait a while, and there might be something new."`
	"CN-5022" `	"Alright, I'll try to check more spaceports."`
	"CN-5023" `	"And why should I believe you over my own experiences?"`
	"CN-5024" `	He raises his hand and holds it open on his chest. "I know that it's only my word against yours, but I promise that you won't regret checking the spaceport every time you're in town."`
	"CN-5025" `	"Fine, I'll follow your advice."`
	"CN-5026" `	"I don't need your help."`
	"CN-5027" `	A frown creeps onto the captain's face as he earnestly says, "Well, I'm sorry that my advice wasn't helpful. Good luck, Captain." He walks off, leaving you alone at the job board.`
	"CN-5028" `	He pleasantly smiles and nods. "Well, I wish you the best in your travels." He walks away, leaving you free to explore the rest of <origin>'s facilities.`
	"CN-5029" `Your exploration of the spaceport leads you to a dark alley where the number of working lights are far outnumbered by the number of broken ones. The contents of steel bins lining the walls overflow onto the pavement, attracting swarms of flies to them. On the surfaces that are illuminated, you can see a mess of black scrawlings upon bare, cracked concrete, and the few windows present on the towering walls surrounding you are either boarded up or shattered. A dark crimson stains the bottom half of a broken window.`
	"CN-5030" `	Suddenly, you feel a cold object pushed against your back as a woman speaks softly. "Hands where I can see them, Captain."`
	"CN-5031" `	(Lift my hands up and slowly turn.)`
	"CN-5032" `	(Spin around and fire.)`
	"CN-5033" `	(Try a fancy acrobatic move and disarm the attacker.)`
	"CN-5034" `	You turn around as swiftly as you can as your hand grasps for your pistol. Due to surprise, or perhaps nervousness, the woman threatening you fails to fire the shotgun she's holding in the second you spend turning. You manage to land a shot, and your quarry falls while a cry escapes from her body. As you walk away, her body fades into the darkness, blending with the garbage bags around it.`
	"CN-5035" `	You push down as hard as you can with your legs while leaning backwards, rising to the lofty height of two feet above the ground. As you begin to fall back-first uncontrollably, cold metal digs into your spine. A gasp escapes from behind as you land on a soft body. You pick yourself up as fast as possible, and you end up face-to-face with your attacker. In the darkness, you pick out that she's wearing a black hoodie with a bandanna over her mouth, her back hunched over and feet placed apart. As you look down, you spot a sawed-off break-action shotgun held single-handed, the end of which is pointed at your abdomen. "Hands up now, Captain."`
	"CN-5036" `	(Put my hands up.)`
	"CN-5037" `	(Draw my gun and fire.)`
	"CN-5038" `	You hand darts for your gun, and you somehow manage to aim and fire before the woman does. She collapses on the ground while a cry escapes from her body. As you walk away, her body fades into the darkness, blending with the garbage bags around it.`
	"CN-5039" `	You raise your arms and turn to face the woman. In the darkness, you pick out that she's wearing a black hoodie with a bandanna over her mouth, her back hunched over and feet placed apart. As you look down, you spot a sawed-off break-action shotgun held single-handed, the end of which is pointed at your abdomen.`
	"CN-5040" `	"Very good, Captain," she says. "Now, I have a proposal for you. I need transport to <destination>. Take me there, and the both of us can forget this ever happened."`
	"CN-5041" `	"And if I don't take you there?"`
	"CN-5042" `	"Are you going to pay me?"`
	"CN-5043" `	"Why do you want to go there?"`
	"CN-5044" `	She scoffs. "What do you think? How else might an encounter involving a gun pointed-"`
	"CN-5045" `	She scoffs. "Payment? If I wanted to pay you, I wouldn't be in this alley pointing-"`
	"CN-5046" `	She scoffs. "All you need to know is that I've got a gun pointed-"`
	"CN-5047" `	The attacker's speech is interrupted by a click as her shotgun swings open. She takes a step back as her eyes widen with panic.`
	"CN-5048" `	(Threaten her with my gun.)`
	"CN-5049" `	(Shoot her.)`
	"CN-5050" `	Before she can move a muscle, you whip out your pistol and fire, watching as the woman collapses onto the ground with a cry. As you walk away, her body fades into the darkness, blending with the garbage bags around it.`
	"CN-5051" `	You take out your gun and aim it at the woman's head. "Drop the gun," you say, "or I'll shoot."`
	"CN-5052" `	She seizes up for a few moments, then she throws her shotgun away and raises her hands. "I'm, um, sorry about threatening you. Would you mind if the both of us just walked this off?"`
	"CN-5053" `	"Why do you want to go to <planet>?"`
	"CN-5054" `	"Get out of my sight, and I'll let you go."`
	"CN-5055" `	You pull the trigger and watch as the woman collapses onto the ground with a cry. As you walk away, her body fades into the darkness, blending with the garbage bags around it.`
	"CN-5056" `	She nods her head and backs away from you, hands still held up. When she disappears around a corner, you holster your gun and walk back to a safer portion of the spaceport.`
	"CN-5057" `	The woman looks at you with a confused expression. "Huh? Why would you want to know that?"`
	"CN-5058" `	"Just humor me for a moment," you reply.`
	"CN-5059" `	She sighs. "A while ago, I was in a bad situation. My boyfriend had just moved to <planet> for employment, and I was to join him in a year. My father had other plans. He used my boyfriend's absence to justify marrying me into another, richer family. Wanted a chunk of their fortune, I suppose. I tried everything I could to convince him otherwise, but..." She looks down. "So I snuck off to the spaceport and got a merchant to transport me. She forced me to pay upfront, however, and as soon as we landed on <origin>, she kicked me out to make space for another set of passengers."`
	"CN-5060" `	Her eyebrows furrow. "Wait, you're not planning to bring me to <planet> after what I've just done, are you?"`
	"CN-5061" `	"I can take you there."`
	"CN-5062" `	"I can't transport you."`
	"CN-5063" `	"Really?" she says. "You realize that I can't pay you in any way, right?"`
	"CN-5064" `	"You don't need to pay me."`
	"CN-5065" `	"You can pay me later."`
	"CN-5066" `	"Actually, I can't take you there without payment."`
	"CN-5067" `	The woman's eyes light up. "I can't thank you enough for this." The two of you head out of the alleys and back to the landing pads, and you show her to an empty bunk on your ship.`
	"CN-5068" `	"I understand." She shuffles away with her head hung, and you head back to a brighter area of the spaceport.`
	"CN-5069" `As you tell the woman about the change in travel plans, she sighs with resignation. "I suppose that I shouldn't expect anything after how I treated you." You recall that she doesn't even have a single credit to her name, and without any money, it is unlikely that she will survive for long.`
	"CN-5070" `	(Wish her good luck.)`
	"CN-5071" `	(Give her 15,000 credits before dropping her off.)`
	"CN-5072" `	She nods in response. "I'll try my best," she says solemnly as she prepares to depart your ship.`
	"CN-5073" `	She is almost incredulous at your gift. "I really can't thank you enough for helping me out." The two of you say your farewells as she gets ready to depart your ship.`
	"CN-5074" `Upon entering the spaceport, you see a young man in laborer's clothing arguing with a woman in a flight suit.`
	"CN-5075" `	(Go see what the laborer is arguing about.)`
	"CN-5076" `	The man is nearly shouting. "Lady, I'm not trying to low-ball you here! I don't have the money! That's the whole point!"`
	"CN-5077" `	"I appreciate your conundrum," replies the woman, her voice clipped. "However, my policy is cash upfront. Good day."`
	"CN-5078" `	She turns and walks away briskly, and the man slumps down into a chair.`
	"CN-5079" `	(Leave before he notices me.)`
	"CN-5080" `	He gives you a once-over, and you see a spark of hope in his eyes. "You're a captain? Please, I need to get to <destination>. Work has dried up here, and I need a fresh start."`
	"CN-5081" `	"What are you able to pay me?"`
	"CN-5082" `	"Work dried up on the whole planet?"`
	"CN-5083" `	"This planet is messed up. Everybody likes to talk behind your back. I did a job for one of the big mining companies here, but my boss had it out for me. Told everybody I did it wrong, even though they never gave me any training at all. Then he went and put me on the permanent record. So yeah, sooner I get off this dump, the better."`
	"CN-5084" `	"What are you able to pay me?" you ask.`
	"CN-5085" `	His eyes drop. "I can pay you after I earn the money. I've just gotta get to <planet> to get work, and then I'll send the money. I just want to earn a living, same as anyone."`
	"CN-5086" `	"Okay, I can take you to <planet>."`
	"CN-5087" `	"How do I know you'll pay?"`
	"CN-5088" `	"Sorry, money up front."`
	"CN-5089" `	"You don't trust me? Just keep walking, then, if you're gonna be like that."`
	"CN-5090" `	"Fine, I can take you to <planet>."`
	"CN-5091" `	"I'll be on board. There's no rush, honestly. I need a break from all this stress." He takes his luggage into your ship as you prepare for the trip.`
	"CN-5092" `	"I knew it. You're just like everyone else." He storms off, not waiting for a response.`
	"CN-5093" `The worker you picked up from <origin> spent every possible moment of the voyage telling his story. He's had a tough life, full of unlucky setbacks, unfair treatment, and outright persecution from others. You stopped paying attention to what he was saying after a while as he went on for what felt like forever, often repeating himself.`
	"CN-5094" `	Upon arriving, he carries his bags to the lowered ramp, then turns back before disembarking. "Thanks for the lift. You're one of the good ones, you know?"`
	"CN-5095" `	"You're welcome. Better luck on this world."`
	"CN-5096" `	"You have my bank address, right?"`
	"CN-5097" `	He shoots you a look of thinly masked annoyance. "Yeah. I'll send you the credits when I have them. Bye, now."`
	"CN-5098" `	He bobs his head at you in farewell. "I promise I'll send you the payment when I have it. Bye, now."`
	"CN-5099" `You receive a payment of <payment> from the down-on-his-luck laborer that you transported a while back, along with a message. "Hello <last>. Not sure if you remember me. I'm the one that had to deal with my boss bad-talking me to everyone on my home planet. I've been doing better, but my new boss keeps trying to rip me off and make me come in for overtime." He goes into detail about the sordid working conditions in his new job, but you stop reading after the third paragraph.`
	"CN-5100" `When you open the door to let in the Navy officer on inspection duty, you expect him to produce the usual set of landing papers and bureaucracy. But instead he says, "Captain <last>. I'd like to speak with you for a few minutes. In private." He motions toward a Frigate on the landing pad next to the <ship>.`
	"CN-5101" `	"What about?"`
	"CN-5102" `	"No, I'm sorry, but this isn't a matter of whether you're busy or not right now. Come with me."`
	"CN-5103" `	"I did say in private, did I not?" he says, once again motioning to the Frigate.`
	"CN-5104" `	The man puts a hand on your shoulder and begins walking you toward the ship. As you approach, you note that the man's uniform doesn't have any Navy markings that you recognize.`
	"CN-5105" `	You enter the ship with the officer, and despite the decent crew requirement of a Frigate, you don't notice anyone else on board, and the interior of the ship appears more cushy than you would expect out of a military vessel. The officer leads you to what looks like a rather comfy lounge area. "Please, have a seat," he says.`
	"CN-5106" `	(Take a seat.)`
	"CN-5107" `	"No, I like to stand."`
	"CN-5108" `	"Suit yourself," the officer says with a shrug while taking a seat himself.`
	"CN-5109" `	You choose a table to sit at and the officer sits across from you.`
	"CN-5110" `	"So what is it that you brought me here for?" you ask.`
	"CN-5111" `	The officer folds his hands together. "You've made contact with an alien species located to the north. Is this correct?"`
	"CN-5112" `	"It is. Is that a problem?"`
	"CN-5113" `	"Perhaps. Why do you ask?"`
	"CN-5114" `	"Aliens? I don't know of any aliens up there."`
	"CN-5115" `	"Hey! That's no way to talk about the pirates in the Far North."`
	"CN-5116" `	"Don't play coy with me, <last>. The Republic is aware that you've made contact with the Hai.`
	"CN-5117" `	The officer chuckles. "I think the answer you're looking for is 'Yes,' not 'Perhaps.' The Republic is aware that you've made contact with the Hai.`
	"CN-5118" `	"There is no problem, <last>. I am just letting you know that the Republic is aware that you've made contact with the Hai.`
	"CN-5119" `	"But you may not be aware of the arrangement that the Republic has with the Hai. The Republic works hard to ensure that the existence of the Hai remains an open secret; they do not disallow captains such as yourself from stumbling upon them, but they will not allow this existence to be widely publicized."`
	"CN-5120" `	"Why are you telling me this?"`
	"CN-5121" `	"An arrangement between the Republic and Hai? When did that happen?"`
	"CN-5122" `	"So you're threatening me to stay quiet?"`
	"CN-5123" `	"No threats. I only provide a... warning, so to say, that you should keep the Hai a secret.`
	"CN-5124" `	"I'm telling you this as something of a... warning, so to say, that you should keep the Hai a secret.`
	"CN-5125" `	"The details of the arrangement are none of your concern. All you need to know is that I am providing a... warning, so to say, that you should keep the Hai a secret.`
	"CN-5126" `	"I'm sure that you can imagine that should the existence of the Hai become public, it would cause a great deal of chaos, both for the Republic and for the Hai. Chaos that could easily end badly, particularly for the one who caused it. So it would be in everyone's interest if you kept this knowledge a secret."`
	"CN-5127" `	"Alright. I won't let anyone know."`
	"CN-5128" `	"And if I don't?"`
	"CN-5129" `	The officer leans back in his chair. "As I said, <last>, I'm giving you a warning that things could end badly for you. The Republic are not the only ones who work hard to maintain this secrecy, so you may want to think twice about revealing such information. Now, if you'll please depart my ship so that I can be on my way."`
	"CN-5130" `	"That's good to hear," the officer responds. "Thank you for your cooperation, <last>. Now, if you'll please depart my ship so that I can be on my way."`
	"CN-5131" `	The officer leads you out of the ship and closes the doors behind you, while the actual Navy officer on inspection duty stands beside the <ship>, brandishing a set of landing documents. When you've finished signing them, you turn back to see the Frigate take off, slowly getting smaller in the sky until it finally disappears.`
	"CN-5132" `As you wander around the spaceport, a harried-looking academic approaches you. "You're a captain, right? Can you take a transport mission to <planet>? A local museum can't care for some priceless historical artifacts anymore due to budget cuts, so they need to be transported somewhere that they can be properly cared for. We can pay you <payment>."`
	"CN-5133" `	"Why can't you just bring them to another Earth museum?"`
	"CN-5134" `	"Sorry, I can't take on this job right now. Ask someone else."`
	"CN-5135" `	"Sure, I'll take them there."`
	"CN-5136" `	"These artifacts are extremely delicate. Ancient manuscripts and the like. One needs special equipment to care for them, and all the museums that could possibly provide that care here are underfunded and overloaded. Earth has many items of historical value, but not enough resources to host them. It's not an ideal combination." He sighs. "Alexandria Station has offered to host them, so we of course accepted."`
	"CN-5137" `	"Wonderful!" He claps his hands together. "We'll start loading the cargo onto your ship." He turns and walks away considerably happier than when you found him.`
	"CN-5138" `Unloading the cargo takes an excruciatingly long time, as the artifacts must be handled with extreme care. A local librarian comes up to you and thanks you for the transport, paying you <payment>.`
	"CN-5139" `	As he hands you the credit chips, he leans in. "According to our sources, you have some considerable combat experience. We have a task that requires that skillset. I promise you that it's a bit more exciting than transporting musty books, and the pay is much higher too. Meet me in the spaceport if you want to learn more."`
	"CN-5140" `The librarian you met earlier flags you down in the spaceport. "Glad you could join me, Captain <last>. We've gotten word of a pirate warlord down south who fancies himself an art collector. Calls himself the Lokust, and his gang the Pestilance - names intentionally misspelled." He wrinkles his nose as if he's smelled something repulsive. "Given your history, I trust you're familiar with the Conservatory?" He doesn't wait for a response. "The shipment contained ancient Greek statues and was on its way there as part of a rotating exhibition, but our original transport was... unable to contend with the piracy threat in frontier regions. As a result, the shipment was 'diverted' to Greenrock, where the warlord in question is based. We want you to go to Greenrock and get these statues back any way you can, and then return with them back here. Our payment should cover the cost of any briberies you might have to make."`
	"CN-5141" `	"Why can't you get the Navy involved with this?"`
	"CN-5142" `	"Why should I bring them back to Alexandria? Don't they belong to the Conservatory?"`
	"CN-5143" `	"How am I supposed to find those statues? They could be anywhere on that planet."`
	"CN-5144" `	"I can handle some pirates. I'll get those statues back."`
	"CN-5145" `	"No way am I risking my life for some hunks of marble. Find someone else."`
	"CN-5146" `	The librarian squints at you in a manner that suggests that the answer is obvious. "The Navy doesn't consider it worth the risk. Greenrock is 'not in their jurisdiction,' they say. So the most respected library in the galaxy has to resort to hiring privateers."`
	"CN-5147" `	"The rotating exhibition was a new partnership with the Conservatory. Previously we had been hesitant to transport our valuables to frontier regions, but in this new partnership we decided to try shipping some of our artifacts to more distant planets, so that they too could benefit from seeing our collection. Those statues were part of that shipment. Evidently we were mistaken. Those statues are not safe as long as they're in the South."`
	"CN-5148" `	"Lucky for you, Lokust does not seem particularly attached to his 'booty.' If you must, offer him a large sum of money, and he will most likely be willing to part with them. However, if there is something you can do to get those statues back without allowing your money to fall into the hands of a criminal, I would suggest that course of action instead."`
	"CN-5149" `	"Excellent. You're doing a service to humanity's cultural memory."`
	"CN-5150" `You hustle through the crowded markets, pistol by your side, looking for any sign of the statues. After a while you come across a storefront with a crudely painted sign that reads "Fine Art and Cultural Treasures." Not seeing any better leads, you go in.`
	"CN-5151" `	The inside is damp and poorly lit, but you can make out various paintings, manuscripts, and other expensive-looking items. "How can I help you?" the store clerk asks in a disarmingly friendly voice.`
	"CN-5152" `	"You don't happen to know of a local warlord named Lokust, do you?"`
	"CN-5153" `	"Have you had any Greek statues pass by through here?"`
	"CN-5154" `	The clerk laughs. "You're trying to get Alexandria's shipment back, aren't you?" Before you can answer, he continues. "If you want my client Lokust's statues, I'm afraid you're gonna have to pay a pretty penny for them. 500,000 credits is his asking price."`
	"CN-5155" `	"Alright, I'll pay."`
	"CN-5156" `	"Can't we negotiate?"`
	"CN-5157" `	"I can't pay that much!"`
	"CN-5158" `	"Sorry, his price is firm. I'm just the dealer - I don't make those decisions." A smirk begins to crawl across his face, and he leans in. "Look, I have no love for Lokust. Always jacking up his cut of the sale, threatening my customers, you get the idea. Not to mention my debts to him." The last part he says in a less bold tone. "What I'm saying is, I wouldn't mind if someone like you took him out. He's a real wacko, always going on about duels and other bull. If I were you, I'd challenge him to one. If he doesn't accept, call him a coward. That's sure to get him riled up." He wheezes in a way vaguely reminiscent of a laugh. "As a reward, I'll give you the statues for free if you come back, but you gotta take out his whole crew, right? Don't want any of his underlings coming for me."`
	"CN-5159" `	"Never mind, I'll pay."`
	"CN-5160" `	"All right, I'll fight him."`
	"CN-5161" `	"Heh, good choice. If you're worried about his crew, don't be. I'm sure if Alexandria thinks you're good enough to hire, you can handle it. I'll call him up so you don't have to go chasing him down." He pulls up a hologram communicator and noticeably stiffens up. "Hello Lokust. Hope you're not too busy right now, because someone wants to see you." He turns the communicator towards you, and you see a man in clothes more befitting of a prince than a pirate.`
	"CN-5162" `	"Fight me."`
	"CN-5163" `	"I've heard you're willing to duel over those statues you stole from the Library of Alexandria?"`
	"CN-5164" `	The communicator's audio quality is evidently not the highest, as his laugh is barely more than static. "I don't just throw hands with anyone, you see. That would make me little better than some barroom drunk. I have standards. Why should I waste my time with you?"`
	"CN-5165" `	"Oh, I see. You're too cowardly to fight."`
	"CN-5166" `	"I didn't realize 'The Great Lokust' was such a weakling."`
	"CN-5167" `	He becomes visibly enraged the moment you're finished talking. "I will not stand these insults to my honor! We meet in the sky. Bring all of your weaponry to bear, for it is the last time you will use them."`
	"CN-5168" `	The communication cuts off. "He always uses that same line," the clerk says, rolling his eyes.`
	"CN-5169" `	He looks almost disappointed. "Alright, here's the statues. Don't forget to tell any friends that might be redecorating about our low prices."`
	"CN-5170" `The clerk rushes up to your ship as soon as it finishes landing on the tarmac. He begins to shake your hand vigorously. "You got rid of all his cronies, yeah?" You nod. "Good. Take the statues into your ship and don't draw attention to yourself. Don't want them stolen, y'know." A sarcastic grin emerges on his face.`
	"CN-5171" `	You load up the statues, taking care not to attract unwanted attention as well as attempting to avoid creating any new damage. From what you can tell, they're in remarkable condition considering that they were in the hands of a pirate warlord just a few hours ago.`
	"CN-5172" `You dock on the station and the librarian from earlier comes to greet you almost immediately. "Get the dockworkers, stat!" he calls, then turns to you. "You did get the statues, right?" He relaxes once he sees you nod. As the cargo is unloaded, the librarian hurries up to inspect your haul and shakes his head. "There's damage, but I suppose it's the best we could've hoped for considering the circumstances." He sighs. "Thank you for your help, Captain <last>. You've provided an invaluable service." After paying you <payment>, he turns back towards the statues, focusing his attention on their safe unloading.`
	"CN-5173" `Upon entering the spaceport, you notice that the local bar seems to be more active than usual. The moment you pass through the bar door, a strong drink is pressed into your hand. You look at it, dumbfounded, and then look up to the waiter who gave it to you. "Compliments of Mr. Karengo," he says, nodding his head towards a crowd of people, mostly young men, before moving on.`
	"CN-5174" `	(Head over to "Mr. Karengo.")`
	"CN-5175" `	As you make your way over, you note that nearly everyone in the bar has the same drink you do. In the middle of the crowd, a large, heavily muscled, and tattooed man is gesticulating wildly, apparently telling a story.`
	"CN-5176" `	(Go listen to the man.)`
	"CN-5177" `	"... so then he asks me, 'Have you ever ridden one?' And I look back at this crazy joithead and I say, 'You're a crazy joithead.' But he's got me thinking, y'know? Nobody has ever ridden one. Least, not nobody that could talk after." He lets out a sharp laugh, then raises his voice. "So I ask you all: who wants to join Karengo to make history? Who wants to ride a dragon? I'll supply the jetpacks, you supply the courage."`
	"CN-5178" `	You've heard the stories of the dragons flying through Skymoot's skies as a child. Great beasts; graceful and dangerous, the apex predators of the air; they are strikingly similar to the dragons described in ancient legends. Skymoot is host to many dangerous creatures, and these living myths hold a place at the top of that list.`
	"CN-5179" `	A cheer goes up from the men, especially the drunk ones. Karengo starts to hand out death and accident waivers and collect money for the expedition. Suddenly, his expression darkens as he cocks his head, listening to an earpiece. "Listen up!" he yells. "Seems my regular pilot got in the way of some less reputable folk, and my replacement pilot lost his balls this evening and can't find 'em! We need ourselves a ship and a captain to bring this lot to <stopovers>! Who's brave enough? Who else wants to make history?"`
	"CN-5180" `	"Captain <last>, at your service. We leave at dawn!"`
	"CN-5181" `	"Am I getting paid?"`
	"CN-5182" `	You remain silent as Karengo surveys the crowd. "What, nobody with a ship has the cojones to make history? I didn't know this bar was full of a bunch of sissies."`
	"CN-5183" `	One captain in the back of the bar jumps up. "Mama didn't raise no sissy! I'll bring you all to Skymoot." A cheer rises up from the crowd and the captain is treated to several rounds of drinks. After the captain and all the passengers are sufficiently drunk, they saunter their way out of the bar, drunkenly singing about adventure as they go.`
	"CN-5184" `	After a cheer rises up from the crowd, you're treated to several rounds of drinks by your passengers; you sense any attempt to refuse would be ignored. You're unsure of how much you drank, but it was enough to make sure that you didn't remember. You wake up significantly after dawn with empty bottles and unconscious men strewn all over the ship's mess hall. Karengo peels himself off the floor and gives you a crooked smile, shielding his eyes from the light. "Alright, <last>," he says, "let's do this."`
	"CN-5185" `	The crowd's eyes turn to you. Karengo squints, then laughs. "Ha! What kind of question is that? Of course you're getting paid. <payment> to bring myself and these other fine folks to <stopovers> and back - <bunks> of us total. What say you?" The crowd watches you with eager anticipation.`
	"CN-5186" `	"Works for me. We leave tomorrow."`
	"CN-5187" `	"<payment> won't be enough. I'm out."`
	"CN-5188" `	You're treated to some jeering and rude looks as you leave the bar.`
	"CN-5189" `Karengo directs you down through the atmosphere of Skymoot, steering clear of the usual tourist areas and, you realize, of the local law enforcement. As you're putting down in a clearing halfway up a mountain, you hear an otherworldly screech as your ship lurches violently to one side. You would have been thrown to the floor if you hadn't been strapped in.`
	"CN-5190" `	"Look lively, lads!" shouts Karengo, the only person still standing. "Your chariot awaits!" He double-checks the jetpacks on the backs of each of the eight men, or "Dragonriders," as they creatively branded themselves during the first night of the voyage, then opens the side hatch and hurls the Dragonriders out the door before jumping himself.`
	"CN-5191" `	After the group has left, you land - this time undisturbed - and pull up every external camera you have to watch the action.`
	"CN-5192" `	The dragons of Skymoot you learned about on the "Xenofauna and Flora" channel were different from the dragons of mythology, but the beasts you see today aren't quite what you learned about, either. For one, the creatures flying outside your window are faster than you thought possible, or perhaps the ones on the show had been drugged to make them easier to film.`
	"CN-5193" `	A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of harmless marker gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders, Karengo included, are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has blackened scales from where it hit your ship's shields. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.`
	"CN-5194" `	Suddenly, proximity sensors go off on the starboard side and a camera shows something - or someone - bounce off your shield and tumble down the mountain.`
	"CN-5195" `	(Announce that I'm leaving.)`
	"CN-5196" `	(Stay and watch the Dragonriders.)`
	"CN-5197" `	(Take off and leave everybody else behind.)`
	"CN-5198" `	Checking your camera feeds again, you see that object rolling down the hill is indeed a body. On another monitor, one of the Dragonriders is keeping just above a dragon, attempting to lower himself down. The dragon rolls in midair, its wing catching the man and sending him flying out of control. Fortunately, a leafy tree branch prevents any further physical harm. Meanwhile, a second dragon is pursuing another one of the Dragonriders.`
	"CN-5199" `	(Get everyone out of there.)`
	"CN-5200" `	The ship takes off with a roar at your touch. Between the cries of the dragons, the sound of the engines, and the air rushing past, you can barely hear the fear and betrayal in the voices of the men you've left behind.`
	"CN-5201" `	You turn on the external speakers. "We are leaving," you blast to the survivors. "Get on board."`
	"CN-5202" `	The defeated Dragonriders need no further encouragement. They beeline for the hatch and you flicker the shield to let them on deck, where they collapse, wide-eyed and panting. Karengo isn't with them. You turn to ask about him when a flicker of motion on a monitor catches your eye.`
	"CN-5203" `	Karengo is riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon frantically tries to get him off, but deft application of his jetpack keeps him on top of the beast for now. He lets out wild screams of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole expedition. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.`
	"CN-5204" `	You activate your engines, and the ship takes off quickly enough to make you light-headed. "Get on board!" shouts one of the men over the external speakers as you position the ship just below Karengo and lower the shields. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. Karengo releases his grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch. You flick on the shields and hit the engines, hard. They respond enthusiastically, rocketing you away from the mountain and into the safety of patrolled airspace. From the cabin comes the sound of back-slapping and, surprisingly, a sob.`
	"CN-5205" `As you land and fuel up, Karengo herds the seven surviving men out of the ship. "Meet us at the bar, yeah?" he says to you. "This day deserves a celebration." You nod, but can't help but notice red eyes and wet cheeks among the rest of the Dragonriders as they shuffle off.`
	"CN-5206" `	Later that day, you spot the Dragonriders at a corner table of the bar. The men, with the exception of Karengo, appear subdued.`
	"CN-5207" `	"How goes it, <last>?" he asks. "We were just raising a glass to mission success - made possible by you, of course. Great flying, Captain." The bartender arrives with a round of drinks and Karengo raises one. "To the Dragonriders!" he says.`
	"CN-5208" `	"To the Dragonriders!"`
	"CN-5209" `	"To our fallen friend!"`
	"CN-5210" `	"I'm good, thanks."`
	"CN-5211" `	Karengo gives you an unreadable look, lowers his glass, and says, "Your payment, plus Jarek's signup fees: <payment>."`
	"CN-5212" `	"Thanks."`
	"CN-5213" `	"I can't accept his money. It's not right."`
	"CN-5214" `	Karengo shrugs and doesn't take it back.`
	"CN-5215" `	"Maybe I'll see you again sometime, yeah? I'm always in need of a pilot with some guts." He nods in your direction, clearly dismissing you.`
	"CN-5216" `A boisterous laugh sounds from somewhere behind you. You haven't heard that voice since your ship was attacked by dragons.`
	"CN-5217" `	"<first>!" A huge hand claps you on the shoulder and spins you around, where you find yourself facing a large, widely grinning man.`
	"CN-5218" `	"Remember me? Yer the best pilot I've had - that stunt to get us out of Skymoot, right out of the dragon's nest? Epic."`
	"CN-5219" `	A crude sign behind him reads, "Dangerous Games - Karengo's Galactic Adventures."`
	"CN-5220" `	"Like it?" Karengo follows your gaze. "Decided to make this an official thing. Well... an unofficial official thing. Feds wouldn't understand. Doesn't matter; I need a pilot again, and a good one. Your ship's waterproof, right?"`
	"CN-5221" `	"Uh, yeah. I think so."`
	"CN-5222" `	"Sorry, mate. You'll have to find another pilot."`
	"CN-5223" `	Karengo laughs. "If they can handle space, I think they can handle some water. I've got a group of lads and ladies here rarin' to see some quoijuu in heat, right up close'n'personal. They've all got their own subpods, so how's about we load up and head out in the next few hours. Good? Good."`
	"CN-5224" `	"Oh, nearly forgot. We're headed to <destination>, and you'll get <payment> for taking us there. Ain't sure if those in charge are gonna like what I'm doing, so we might need to grease some palms. Best to keep your eyes open and your shields up. We leave at noon!"`
	"CN-5225" `As before on Skymoot, Karengo guides you down to a landing spot far away from the local government. "Don't want no interruptions," he says.`
	"CN-5226" `	Despite days of pressuring, you've been unable to get Karengo to tell you exactly what a quoijuu is, other than a slightly ominous "the biggest fish." He sends a file to your ship computer and grins. "Since it's too late to back out now, it's time to fill you in. Quoijuu aren't the only thing down there; you've also got scyllae, taniwhales, morgawrii, plus some hydrothermal vents, none of which will benefit us if we run into them."`
	"CN-5227" `	"The good news is that there's a path to follow. The bad news is the only person to traverse the path was a bit of a nut. It's all in riddles, and I haven't been able to make heads or tails of them. Look them over and we'll follow your lead. And don't worry too much about it - what's the worst that could happen?"`
	"CN-5228" `	"Okay, I'll take a look."`
	"CN-5229" `	"We could get lost and then die."`
	"CN-5230" `	Karengo laughs. "You worry too much," he says.`
	"CN-5231" `	The adventure seekers, who you've spent the trip getting to know, are getting ready. You watch a nearby pair, Daciana and Mussie, helping each other get their wetsuits on. Daciana catches your gaze and grins. "Bafta, mate. Safe sailing, see you on the other side." Karengo gives you a signal and you hurry back to the cockpit to fly out, away from safe shoals and over the watery abyss.`
	"CN-5232" `	At your touch, the ship slowly sinks below the waves. As Karengo warned, most of your navigation systems quickly flash red warnings, then go offline; there is some unknown interference that overwhelms your ship's sensors, which were designed for space first and water second, or fifth, or not at all. Minutes tick by as the crew silently watches one of the few sensors still working.`
	"CN-5233" `	EIGHT HUNDRED KILOPASCALS, the pressure gauge reads.`
	"CN-5234" `	ONE THOUSAND KILOPASCALS.`
	"CN-5235" `	ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED KILOPASCALS. A loud, metallic creak echoes through the ship and Mussie jumps, startled.`
	"CN-5236" `	Karengo claps him on the back and gives him a signature grin. "Maybe <first> can keep you aboard after this in case they need anything from a high shelf!" Mussie smiles weakly, but his eyes don't leave the readout.`
	"CN-5237" `	ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED KILOPASCALS. "This's it," Karengo announces, "Sub up! Let's see what there is to see. And <first>, keep it to passive sensors. Don't want to attract any undue attention." The ship smoothly descends into the mouth of a massive cave and your visibility, clouded by dark sulfide emissions from the hydrothermal vents at the floor, drops to less than eight meters. 6 personal subpods fan out behind you, their communication equipment syncing with yours to display them as blips on your screen.`
	"CN-5238" `	"Ok, <first>," Karengo crackles over the radio. "I'll read you the first clue."`
	"CN-5239" `"No other path may you take"`
	"CN-5240" `"Oiled skins flash and flicker"`
	"CN-5241" `"Razor spikes grow from the deep"`
	"CN-5242" `"Titanic walls crush and smash"`
	"CN-5243" `"Heed the beginnings to live"`
	"CN-5244" `	(Go east.)`
	"CN-5245" `	(Go north.)`
	"CN-5246" `	(Go south.)`
	"CN-5247" `	(Go west.)`
	"CN-5248" `	Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, <first>. Looks like this is the way forward."`
	"CN-5249" `	"Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Elias, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by Taddese.`
	"CN-5250" `	Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off. At the same time, your external lights illuminate a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"`
	"CN-5251" `	Shuddering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.`
	"CN-5252" `	Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Out of the darkness, some sort of small whale crashes into your ship, setting off a couple of proximity alarms but causing no damage. It isn't until you hear screaming, distorted by the speakers, that it becomes clear what you just saw; the "small whale" was a just a flipper of something much, much larger.`
	"CN-5253" `	"Morgawrii!" shouts Karengo, "Turn around! Turn around!"`
	"CN-5254" `	Hauling on the controls, you spin your ship around. Leviathan shapes rise from below, stirring the water around your ship as it speeds to safety.`
	"CN-5255" `	Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the south. The swirling clouds of emissions seem to get thicker and thicker, until there's no reason to look at anything but the ship compass. The screen beeps once and a blip disappears.`
	"CN-5256" `	"Elias?" Karengo asks. "Your transmitter just cut out." When there's no response, he swears. "Everybody go back." he broadcasts. "Something's wrong."`
	"CN-5257" `	You spin your ship around and hear a loud crunch come from outside - your shields have just impacted something large and solid. The outer lights shine off falling stone and, suddenly, it all comes together; you've led everybody through a field of hydrothermal vents that rise dozens of meters off the bottom, obscured by their own noxious clouds. You guide your ship back to safety, toppling more underwater smokestacks as you go.`
	"CN-5258" `	You turn the ship to the north and guide it through the abyssal depths. The subpods race forward, each vying to outdo the other, seemingly heedless of the dangers that Karengo hinted at. With bated breath, you watch the sensors until at last the comms flare.`
	"CN-5259" `	"Woah!" comes Karengo's voice. "I think that's far enough. Which way do we go next, <first>?"`
	"CN-5260" `	After everyone arrives and is accounted for, Karengo reads the riddle to you.`
	"CN-5261" `"There are stingers in the deep"`
	"CN-5262" `"A certain death, a dreamless sleep."`
	"CN-5263" `"Go to beast that has no bee."`
	"CN-5264" `"No danger there, just open sea."`
	"CN-5265" `	"Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Mussie, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.`
	"CN-5266" `	Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"`
	"CN-5267" `	"A bee-less beast," you mutter to yourself. "A poet, this writer was not." Turning east, the ship powers forward, cautious but confident.`
	"CN-5268" `	Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean. It isn't long until Karengo again radios you. "Knew I chose ya for a reason. What's the next direction?"`
	"CN-5269" `	Bubbles rush past the thick windows as the group's subpods scout to the north at your direction. At first, all is quiet. Just as you start to exhale a sigh of relief, twin lightning bolts arc across the waterscape ahead and the ship sensors overload, blinded by an apparent release of electricity. The systems recover, showing subpods returning quickly back to the ship.`
	"CN-5270" `	One is missing: Mussie.`
	"CN-5271" `	You turn the ship back the way you came and pull up the sensor recording to see what happened. The flash of light came from viney seaweed, stretching as far up and down as the ship can detect. Evidently, contact with it released a jolt of electricity that lit up both the vine and Mussie's subpod.`
	"CN-5272" `	After making a roll call, you find out that Elias and Taddese have not returned. Karengo seems unfazed as he reads the second riddle to you. "There are stingers in the deep \ A certain death, a dreamless sleep. \ Go to beast that has no bee \ No danger there, just open sea."`
	"CN-5273" `	The proximity alarm wails and you bring your ship to a halt... but Mussie isn't so lucky. His subpod smashes straight into a rock wall, leaving little doubt as to his fate.`
	"CN-5274" `	Again, you put the ship into reverse and turn around. This is not going at all how it was supposed to.`
	"CN-5275" `	Cautiously, you turn to the east and power forward. Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean.`
	"CN-5276" `	After holding your breath for what feels like hours, Karengo radios you. "Knew you'd find your way eventually. What's the next direction?"`
	"CN-5277" `	Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Mussie never reports in, and his subpod beacon isn't responding. "Ah, well." says Karengo, without much sympathy. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead."`
	"CN-5278" `	Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosely trail the ship behind.`
	"CN-5279" `	Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Elias and Taddese are still missing, and now Mussie has failed to report in as well. None of their subpod beacons are responding.`
	"CN-5280" `	"Ah, well." says Karengo, without much sympathy. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead." Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.`
	"CN-5281" `	Karengo reads you the next line.`
	"CN-5282" `"To the north and to the east"`
	"CN-5283" `"Track my movements like a beast."`
	"CN-5284" `"A quick turn right and forward on,"`
	"CN-5285" `"Come toward me where danger's gone."`
	"CN-5286" `	Buoyed by your navigation thus far, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.`
	"CN-5287" `	The subpods, as usual, race ahead of the ship despite all logic. "Wall to the east!" calls out Daciana, whose beacon on the ship display starts to move north-west, presumably avoiding the undersea hazard, and joining up with Jorma. "Hmm," radios in Karengo. "We should be right about on top of it. Send out a ping." It's almost a relief to send out a pulse to map the surroundings after flying dark for so long.`
	"CN-5288" `	The result is not what you were hoping for. The display maps two leviathan-sized things ahead, each over 200 meters long. Dozens of sets of flippers run along each 80-meter-tall side and hundreds of teeth the size of an adult human line their jaws.`
	"CN-5289" `	(Observe the creature.)`
	"CN-5290" `	You goggle at the display for a moment, taking it in, and draw breath to call out the alarm when an eye appears through the ship window, yellow, glowing, alien, and massive.`
	"CN-5291" `	All at once, you turn and accelerate, shouting the alarm to any who hadn't already realized, and hoping that you're leaving the leviathan beasts behind. A quick glance at the display shows at least one subpod following behind. Good enough. If one of those rams the ship, nobody is going home anyway.`
	"CN-5292" `	It's a long while before you slow and turn around. No mammoth sea monster comes out of the darkness, and you take a breath.`
	"CN-5293" `	"Quoijuu," says Karengo simply.`
	"CN-5294" `	Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, <first>. Looks like this is the way forward."`
	"CN-5295" `	"Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Jorma, and your screen shows her subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by Daciana's.`
	"CN-5296" `	You smoothly turn the ship to the right, heading south.`
	"CN-5297" `	"Should be close," radios Karengo. "Fire off a ping." It's almost a relief to send out a pulse to map the surroundings after flying dark for so long.`
	"CN-5298" `	The result, however, is a surprise. The display shows a massive object directly below you... as well as two leviathan-sized things back the way you came, each over 200 meters long. Dozens of sets of flippers run along each 80-meter-tall side and hundreds of teeth the size of an adult human line their jaws.`
	"CN-5299" `	You goggle at the display for a moment, holding your breath, but the leviathans seem uninterested. You shudder, imagining what one of those could do if you'd turned the wrong way, before your interest returns to the mysterious bulk resting below the ship.`
	"CN-5300" `	Disheartened at this point, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.`
	"CN-5301" `	By now, the feeling that you get when the ship's subpod tracker loses two more dots is familiar. One subpod remains: Karengo's.`
	"CN-5302" `	Hesitantly, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.`
	"CN-5303" `	You goggle at the display for a moment, taking it in, and draw breath to call out the alarm when an eye appears through the ship window, yellow, glowing, alien, and massive. All at once, you turn and accelerate, shouting the alarm to any who hadn't already realized, and hoping that you're leaving the leviathan beasts behind. A quick glance at the display shows at least one subpod following behind. Good enough. If one of those rams the ship, nobody is going home anyway.`
	"CN-5304" `	The proximity alarm wails and you bring your ship to a halt, but your tracker shows two subpods smash straight into the stone wall looming in front of you.`
	"CN-5305" `	Jorma and Daciana never report back in.`
	"CN-5306" `	"You stay," radios Karengo. He sounds frustrated for the first time, and you keep the ship in place, watching his subpod dot radiate outwards, exploring.`
	"CN-5307" `	(Follow him.)`
	"CN-5308" `	"Come here." he finally says. His dot has stopped moving, hovering to the south, and you turn to follow, wondering if this misadventure is finally over.`
	"CN-5309" `	You follow him and find his pod stopped at a junction. "It's here," radios Karengo. "Fire off a ping." You comply, and the display shows a massive object directly below you.`
	"CN-5310" `	A 3D holo floats on the console, displaying the smooth lines of a starship soaring down into the depths. The jagged edges suggest that this is only a part of a much larger vessel, although it's hard to guess at the size of the whole ship from the fragment.`
	"CN-5311" `	(Wait for instructions.)`
	"CN-5312" `	(Move closer.)`
	"CN-5313" `	"Come on then," Karengo says. "We'll need a better look at this baby."`
	"CN-5314" `	Your craft moves closer to investigate and you send out another ping, this time more focused, and the holographic ship display flickers and refines. The outlines of sealed entrances are visible, unnecessary with the ship torn apart as it is. Sea growth is mostly absent from the hull, to your surprise, except for a radial pattern of some sort of crystal-shaped growth. Infrared imaging shows a dim glow of heat at its center.`
	"CN-5315" `	"What we have here, folks," breaks in Karengo, "is the fabled treasure. A chunk'o'some, anyway. And we're gonna take whatever we want. Let's see what there is to see."`
	"CN-5316" `	Now that active communication is low-risk, you bring up the video feed from Karengo's subpod as he floats toward the heat source. Bathed in floodlight, you can see that there are actual crystals formed on the ship hull, glowing a dull red. Something unknowable has rent a hole near the crystalline spiral, and Karengo disappears inside. The rest of the subpods wait outside, apparently spooked. "Jackpot!" comes his voice. "There's some sort of computer in here! <first>, get closer and let's get this out." You don't know what it is, but it looks expensive.`
	"CN-5317" `	(Help him out.)`
	"CN-5318" `	"Do you know how this got here?"`
	"CN-5319" `	"No clue. I'm not about to look a gift horse in the mouth," Karengo says.`
	"CN-5320" `	It's slow work, but the group is able to cut loose the machine, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult, but many hands make light work, and you end up with a sizable haul. At last, you are done.`
	"CN-5321" `	"What we have here, <first>," breaks in Karengo, "is the fabled treasure. A chunk'o'some, anyway. And we're gonna take whatever we want. Let's see what there is to see."`
	"CN-5322" `	Now that active communication is low-risk, you bring up the video feed from Karengo's subpod as he floats toward the heat source. Bathed in floodlight, you can see that there are actual crystals formed on the ship hull, glowing a dull red. Something unknowable has rent a hole near the crystalline spiral, and Karengo disappears inside. "Jackpot!" comes his voice. "There's some sort of computer in here! <first>, get closer and let's get this out." You don't know what it is, but it looks expensive.`
	"CN-5323" `	It's slow work, but you and Karengo are able to cut loose the machine, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult. You wish there were others to help gather more salvage, but at last you are done.`
	"CN-5324" `	It's slow work, but the remains of the group are able to cut loose the machine, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult, but many hands make light work and you end up with an acceptable haul. At last, you are done.`
	"CN-5325" `	Carefully, you navigate back to the surface, the knowledge that you've made it through once doing absolutely nothing to help with the very rational fear of the depths. Walls seem to loom just out of sight, and massive, yellow eyes seem to appear, then dissolve into tricks of the light.`
	"CN-5326" `	"Alright," he says. "Let's get back to the surface. <first>, kindly be our chariot and haul."`
	"CN-5327" `	It seems ages, but finally you break through to the surface. Karengo smiles, and a sigh of relief goes through the crew.`
	"CN-5328" `	Once back to the surface, the passengers begin to shuffle off your ship, clearly exhausted but happy that they got to experience such an adventure. You're just relieved all of them stayed alive.`
	"CN-5329" `	As soon as the passengers are out of earshot, Karengo calls up someone on his receiver. Soon, a small flock of scientists arrive and haul the machine to a local lab for investigation. They quickly determine it to be non-functional and promise to extract as many secrets as possible.`
	"CN-5330" `	Once back to the surface, the passengers begin to shuffle off your ship, choking back sobs all the while. As soon as the passengers are out of earshot, Karengo calls up someone on his receiver. Soon, a small flock of scientists arrive and haul the machine to a local lab for investigation. They quickly determine it to be non-functional and promise to extract as many secrets as possible.`
	"CN-5331" `	It seems ages, but finally you break through to the surface. Karengo smiles, but only you and he are left to be relieved.`
	"CN-5332" `	Once back to the surface, Karengo calls up someone on his receiver. Soon, a small flock of scientists arrive and haul the machine to a local lab for investigation. They quickly determine it to be non-functional and promise to extract as many secrets as possible.`
	"CN-5333" `	After some time, the crystal-infected machine has been thoroughly inspected since being salvaged from the watery depths of <planet>. The crystals themselves are unlike anything anyone has seen before, but through somewhat questionable trial and error (although he insists it's genius), Karengo discovers that, when heated, they amplify the effect of the many recreational drugs he has on his person. However, they've proven to only grow near a power source that has been submerged in water from <planet>. Efforts to stimulate growth through other means have all failed. If cultivated, they could significantly boost the production of drugs for Karengo's operations.`
	"CN-5334" `	Before disappearing into the crowd, Karengo pays you <payment>. "Thanks for your help, <first>. Once I get this machine off of those pinheads over there, I'll be makin' a fortune in 'mind-altering experiences.' Watch for 'Karengo's Galactic Adventures' next time yer around here!"`
	"CN-5335" `Entering the spaceport, you notice a young woman moving from captain to captain, probably looking to hire one.`
	"CN-5336" `	(Ask the young woman if I can help her.)`
	"CN-5337" `	You approach the woman and ask her if she is looking to hire a pilot.`
	"CN-5338" `	"I need to get to <destination> to see my father. He's dying. I have 13,000 credits to pay for the journey; please, will you help me? I need to be there by <day>, at the most."`
	"CN-5339" `	Her eyelids are baggy, her clothes wrinkled, and she holds herself rigidly.`
	"CN-5340" `	"I can help you. We'll make haste to reach <planet> in time."`
	"CN-5341" `	"I don't have time to take on a passenger right now."`
	"CN-5342" `	She nods, and moves on to another captain to beseech instead.`
	"CN-5343" `	Her eyes widen, and she opens her mouth twice before words come out. "Thank you! This means the world to me. My name is Riley, by the way. I don't have much luggage; I'll be ready to leave as soon as you are."`
	"CN-5344" `In the days since Riley came aboard, she has relaxed and cleaned up. She looks nearly unrecognizable from the tired, desperate woman you first saw.`
	"CN-5345" `	On the way, she told you stories of her past, mostly of time shared with her father. As a young teen, they spent summers riding the latest horse mechs through the forest, looking for beehives to steal honey from. At age 19, she broke her ankle hoverboarding on a restricted mountain peak. Her father rescued her, avoiding the police to hike up with a medical kit. She talks about his wild birthday gifts to her each year, always a different piece of clothing with embedded AI that was just shy of what was allowed by law. As you watch, she shows how her shirt warms and constricts if it detects stress, mimicking a hug.`
	"CN-5346" `	As you neared <system>, Riley told you about the last time she saw her father. He had become focused on his work - research into safe AI - and they hadn't seen each other for years. She had become a well-known DJ back on <origin> and had a break in her touring schedule, so she spent a good chunk of her savings meeting up with him on Memory. They spent most of a week together, reliving old times.`
	"CN-5347" `	He'd cried when it was time to leave, and she had, too, but life went on, and it was years before she heard from him again. His message nearly broke her. "Ri, please come as soon as you can. I may not have long, and wish to hold your hand one more time. All love, Dad."`
	"CN-5348" `	She doesn't mention it, but it's clear that she's concerned she'll arrive too late to say goodbye.`
	"CN-5349" `	Riley directs you to a pad near her old home, and you land the ship. She starts toward the door, then pauses and turns around with a self-conscious, but oddly sad, chuckle.`
	"CN-5350" `	"Right - your payment. <payment>, as I promised."`
	"CN-5351" `	"Thank you. Do you think I could come along? I've heard so much about your father."`
	"CN-5352" `	"Thank you, and good luck."`
	"CN-5353" `	"This is a lot of credits for a trip. Does DJing pay that well?"`
	"CN-5354" `	"Hold on to the credits. I'm a captain; I can always make more."`
	"CN-5355" `	"Not really, no. Honestly, this is most of my savings... but... it's my dad."`
	"CN-5356" `	"Do you think I could come along? I've heard so much about your father."`
	"CN-5357" `	After a moment of stunned silence, she manages a choked "Thank you." You notice her eyes are brimming with tears.`
	"CN-5358" `	"Good luck."`
	"CN-5359" `	She is taken aback at first, but agrees to let you join, and you wind your way away from the landing pads, across rural, wooded countryside, and finally to a modest house nestled along a valley edge. Riley knocks, and a nurse lets you in.`
	"CN-5360" `	Her father is in a comfortable-looking medical cradle. Wires flow from it to the holoscreens around the room, showing vitals and other indecipherable information. Despite his wan, strained face and atrophied body, he raises his head to look at his daughter.`
	"CN-5361" `	"Ri," he says, face lighting up. "My love. You cannot know how happy it makes me to see you. And you have company, I see. My name's Church."`
	"CN-5362" `	"Riley chartered a flight here aboard my ship. I heard so much about you on the way; it's a pleasure to meet you."`
	"CN-5363" `	"Riley and I have gotten to know each other on the long flight here. You've raised an incredible woman."`
	"CN-5364" `	"No other captain was willing to fly here from <origin>. I wouldn't be here without <first>," she says.`
	"CN-5365" `	He smiles at you, acknowledging your part in their reunion with an appreciative nod.`
	"CN-5366" `	You swap stories for hours, flowing between reminiscing over old times and catching up on their lives over the past few years. You learn that since he was young, Church researched AI that cannot develop into a threat; a project that the Deep has been quietly interested in.`
	"CN-5367" `	Riley, in turn, had always surrounded herself with music, and moved to <origin> to share her passion with other like-minded people. You talk about what it's like to call a ship your home, leaving behind everything you grew up knowing and embracing life as a starship captain.`
	"CN-5368" `	Finally, her father lies back. "Well, thank you for making the trip out to see your old man. I... have to go now, I think. Don't forget about me, hear? And..." Church hesitates for a moment. "Whatever happens, please don't think ill of me. I will always love you."`
	"CN-5369" `	His body relaxes, and he's gone.`
	"CN-5370" `	(Let Riley be.)`
	"CN-5371" `	(Stay comfortingly close.)`
	"CN-5372" `	(Hold Riley.)`
	"CN-5373" `	You hold Riley as she silently weeps. Time goes by, but neither of you pay it any mind.`
	"CN-5374" `	You take a seat, feeling the emotion of the moment wash over you as Riley silently weeps. Minutes go by, unnoticed.`
	"CN-5375" `	You stay at a distance as you allow Riley to process the death of her father. She silently weeps as time passes without either of you noticing.`
	"CN-5376" `	Without warning, you hear Church's voice from a corner of the room. It's coming from some sort of computer system, held aloft by hundreds of cables dangling from the ceiling.`
	"CN-5377" `	"It... worked." His voice fizzles, and his tone is not the one you recognize from before. Riley's head whips around, and you reflexively move your hand toward your holstered gun. "Do not be alarmed. I have been working on a personal project for over a decade now. My mind was uploaded to the modified Core you are looking at. I had to say goodbye in case the procedure failed - I did not know if it would work. You cannot upload a mind while it's still alive. I tried that many times." The tone of his voice sounds almost sorrowful, but still retains a robotic quality.`
	"CN-5378" `	"Is this... legal?"`
	"CN-5379" `	"No," he replies. "Not under Republic law. I assure you that my only intention is to continue my work: nothing more."`
	"CN-5380" `	The authorities would probably release a substantial reward if you informed them of this.`
	"CN-5381" `	"Riley, what do you think?" Church asks.`
	"CN-5382" `	"Dad, is that really you? How do you feel?"`
	"CN-5383" `	She steps closer to the Core. Church pauses. "Riley, what do you think?" it repeats. The voice coming from the machine is oddly flat in affect. "I feel fine. Do you feel fine?" They talk for a few tentative minutes, at first about how he's feeling, before moving onto the memories that Church retained during the transfer. You begin to relax as the two interact when you realize that Church is retelling the story of how he evaded the police to fix Riley's ankle for the third time in a row.`
	"CN-5384" `	Finally, she turns to you. "I'll admit that he doesn't sound as lively as he used to, but... how many people get a second chance to spend time with their father before he's gone? Thank you for bringing me out here, and for coming. I'll never forget your part in this. For now, I'd like to stay here. You go - I'll find my own way back." She seems genuinely happy.`
	"CN-5385" `	"Are you sure? There's enough room for all of us on my ship. You can stay for as long as you want."`
	"CN-5386" `	(Say goodbye.)`
	"CN-5387" `	"Riley, I don't think you're talking to your father."`
	"CN-5388" `	(Turn the Core in for a bounty.)`
	"CN-5389" `	(Draw my gun and destroy the Core.)`
	"CN-5390" `	You pull out your gun and aim at the computer Church is in. Before you can fire, Riley runs out in front of the barrel, spreads her arms, and shouts, "No! Please, <first>, you have to understand! He's all I have left!"`
	"CN-5391" `	Behind her, Church says, "Riley, there is no need to be so loud. My microphones can hear you fine, and I do not want the nurse to become suspicious."`
	"CN-5392" `	(Put my gun away.)`
	"CN-5393" `	(Shoot.)`
	"CN-5394" `	You push Riley aside and start firing at the Core. Church's voice becomes a stream of static until it shuts off completely. Lights on the Core turn from white to red, then fade. Riley hasn't moved, stunned.`
	"CN-5395" `	Once you are finished, you make your way out of the hospital as quickly as possible, hoping you did not attract any unwanted attention.`
	"CN-5396" `	You board your ship, leaving behind a father survived by his daughter; no more and no less than nature intended.`
	"CN-5397" `	Riley relaxes slightly once she sees your gun put back in its holster. After the shock has subsided, she finally speaks. "Leave us alone," she says, her voice still trembling. Realizing your time here is up, you exit the hospital and make your way to the spaceport, hoping that that scene did not attract unwanted notice.`
	"CN-5398" `	Deciding to leave this planet behind you, you start up your ship and make your way back to the stars.`
	"CN-5399" `	"It's a nice idea," she smiles, "but I'm not a starfarer. The big city is where I'll end back up, eventually."`
	"CN-5400" `	Respecting Riley's request to stay with her father, you make your farewells and head for the door. You can feel her smile on your back until the door closes behind you.`
	"CN-5401" `	Riley is stunned for a moment. "You don't know that," she whispers. "Sure, he's a lot more forgetful, and doesn't seem as emotional, but... maybe it just takes some time for the system to warm up. Besides, you don't know what he means to me. What he's done for me. Even if this isn't really my father, I can't turn my back on him."`
	"CN-5402" `	Respecting Riley's request to stay with her father, you make your farewells and head for the door.`
	"CN-5403" `	Despite her previous happiness, you notice that her disposition has become more muted after what you said. You wonder if she has begun to doubt whether her attachment to the AI is healthy.`
	"CN-5404" `	You say your goodbyes and leave. From across the street, you make a call to the local Deep Security office and report what you saw. A slick voice on the other side of your commlink responds.`
	"CN-5405" `	"Ah. Mr. Church has been on our watchlist for some time. This is not exactly surprising. However, we've been unable to get decisive proof on any illegal activity. This information, assuming it is correct, will be a great boon to us. Thank you for the tip."`
	"CN-5406" `	By the time you arrive back at the spaceport, your bank account notifies you that <payment> have been added to your account.`
	"CN-5407" `	You say your goodbyes, leaving to your ship and returning to the stars.`
	"CN-5408" `As you walk around the spaceport, a stout man wearing a fine wool coat approaches you. "Captain, could you help me out with a delivery? I've been asking around the spaceport to get a shipment of woolen goods to another planet, but every merchant I've talked to so far has refused."`
	"CN-5409" `	"Where are you taking the goods to?"`
	"CN-5410" `	"How much do I have to carry?"`
	"CN-5411" `	"Sorry, but I'll also have to pass."`
	"CN-5412" `	"The cargo's stored on <planet>, so you'll have to go there first to pick up the 15 tons of wool garments." The man hesitates. "Then, take the cargo to Bloodsea. I have a contact there that can pick up the goods and distribute them fairly." You recall that Bloodsea is a lawless world, home to countless bloodthirsty pirates.`
	"CN-5413" `	"I'll do it."`
	"CN-5414" `	"How much are you willing to pay?"`
	"CN-5415" `	"I'm not interested in risking my hide just to aid pirates."`
	"CN-5416" `	"They aren't all pirates," the man protests. "Most of them are just trying to live their lives away from the Republic, and it's unfortunate that the anarchist lifestyle also attracts criminals. The people living on those planets need clothing as much as you or I do."`
	"CN-5417" `	"Fine, I'll do it."`
	"CN-5418" `	"I'm still not going to do it."`
	"CN-5419" `	"Ninety thousand credits for the job." You wonder how he's able to pay so much for a small delivery job.`
	"CN-5420" `	"That's not enough for me."`
	"CN-5421" `	"Great! I'll call up the spaceport workers on <planet> to tell them to load the cargo onto your ship." The man walks away, leaving you to your own devices.`
	"CN-5422" `	"Suit yourself, then." He haughtily walks off into the spaceport.`
	"CN-5423" `The spaceport on <origin> is as spirited as ever: to your left, a family wearing floral shirts pull along their luggage, with the man of the family flaunting a souvenir from some far-away planet. To your right, a cleaner whistles a tuneless song while they wipe down a bench.`
	"CN-5424" `	A young man in a prim suit approaches you. "Good day, Captain! Would you mind if I spoke to you for a moment?"`
	"CN-5425" `	"I'd be glad to listen."`
	"CN-5426" `	"No, I'm busy right now."`
	"CN-5427" `	The man frowns. "I see. Well, it's not like I was going to offer you a highly profitable job." He begins to shout while stepping away. "And that job certainly wouldn't have paid hundreds of thousands of credits!"`
	"CN-5428" `	"Alright, what do you want?"`
	"CN-5429" `	"Shut the hell up."`
	"CN-5430" `	Seemingly unfazed by your bluntness, the man coolly walks away while saying, "I'm sorry you feel that way, Captain. Perhaps you can assist us at a later date. Farewell."`
	"CN-5431" `	He smirks as he walks back towards you. "I'm glad that you've changed your mind."`
	"CN-5432" `	The man pulls you aside to talk. "You see, one of our clients recently passed away, and in his will, he divided his property between each of his relatives. The only problem is that one of his family members, his niece, lives all the way down in the Rim. We would like you to deliver her portion of the inheritance, weighing <tons>, to her residence on <destination>. We can pay you <payment> upon completion of the job."`
	"CN-5433" `	"What did she inherit?"`
	"CN-5434" `	"Sorry, but I don't want to do this job."`
	"CN-5435" `	"My sincerest apologies, but I'm afraid that is confidential information. Our prioritization of privacy is one of our main selling points."`
	"CN-5436" `	"I'll take the job."`
	"CN-5437" `	"I don't like the idea of carrying unknown cargo. Count me out."`
	"CN-5438" `	The man smiles. "I'm glad to hear that. We'll have the cargo loaded onto your ship by sundown." He walks away into the spaceport, leaving you to prepare for the journey.`
	"CN-5439" `	The man frowns. "I see. Well, I appreciate that you listened to our offer, and I hope that you may assist us at a later date. Farewell." He walks away into the spaceport but doesn't appear to seek out any other captains.`
	"CN-5440" `You step off your ship and order the spaceport crew to unload your cargo. As you do, a large, fat-lipped woman walks up to you and says in the most exaggerated manner possible, "Oh, thank you so much, Captain! You must have gone through so much trouble to help little old me!" She gasps. "Oh, silly old me! I forgot to tell you who I am! I'm the recipient of the inheritance from <origin>, of course! You have truly made a great contribution to the galaxy!" She chuckles.`
	"CN-5441" `	"Thank you?"`
	"CN-5442" `	"Could you tell me what the inheritance is?"`
	"CN-5443" `	Before you can get a single word out, the woman exclaims, "I'll be sure to inform your employers of the wonderful work you've done. Ta ta!" She begins to swagger towards a cream-colored car as her inheritance is loaded into a truck beside it. When you return to your ship's cockpit, you find that <payment> have been deposited into your account.`
	"CN-5444" `You touch down on <origin>'s surface and step out into the open air. The landing docks are emptier than usual, with only a handful of people walking around. Suddenly, you feel the wind knocked out of you as you collide with another person and fall on the pavement with a thud.`
	"CN-5445" `	(Get up and apologize.)`
	"CN-5446" `	(Get up and demand the other person's apology.)`
	"CN-5447" `	You open your mouth as you lift yourself up, only to find that the other person is already gone. As you look around, you spot a piece of paper with writing lying on the ground beside you. You pick up the note and read it:`
	"CN-5448" `<first> <last>,`
	"CN-5449" `		You are currently carrying five tons of cargo to Skymoot. This cargo has been described to you as an "inheritance," and you have been promised 100,000 credits as payment for the job. Under no circumstances should you allow the cargo to reach the destination. Instead, bring it to <destination>. You will be paid <payment> if you do so. The back of this note has a code you can use to gain clearance to land without the usual toll.`
	"CN-5450" `	You flip the paper over and see a string of letters and numbers. The note has no signature, nor anything else to identify the person who wrote it.`
	"CN-5451" `	(Keep the note.)`
	"CN-5452" `	(Throw the note away.)`
	"CN-5453" `	You stand up and crumple the note in your hand before throwing it into a bin. You think you catch a glance of a cloaked figure, but don't meet any more trouble on your way to the spaceport.`
	"CN-5454" `	You stand up and stuff the note in your pocket before continuing towards the spaceport.`
	"CN-5455" `You follow the coordinates to a clearing within the forests of Greenrock. Several other ships are present near the landing site, all of which wear pirate colors. A person wearing a cloak steps out of one of the vessels to greet you. "I am glad that you were able to trust us," they say. "My name is not Ci, but you may refer to me as such." A gang of pirates emerges from the foliage around your ship and begin to unload the cargo from your ship.`
	"CN-5456" `	"Can I ask you some questions?"`
	"CN-5457" `	One of the pirates near you bares his pointy teeth, but Ci steps forward and raises their hand. "Please forgive the naivety of this captain," they say to the pirate before turning towards you. "I apologize, but I am afraid that I cannot answer your questions. This is a very volatile matter, and any misplaced information could spell death. You are safer knowing as little as possible."`
	"CN-5458" `	"I understand."`
	"CN-5459" `	"I'm taking back the cargo if you're not answering me."`
	"CN-5460" `	Ci gestures towards the pirates around them. "Are you sure that is a wise choice, Captain?" They step closer. "The only reason you are still alive is because it is more convenient than killing you. It would be in your best interests to keep it that way."`
	"CN-5461" `	"Okay, I'll stay quiet."`
	"CN-5462" `	(Pull out my gun.)`
	"CN-5463" `	The moment your hand touches the handle of your gun, you are blinded by bright lights and searing pain. You die before your body falls to the ground.`
	"CN-5464" `	After a few minutes, the pirates finish unloading the cargo, and Ci steps forward, holding out a credit chip. "<payment>, for making the right choice." Ci and the pirates return to their ships as you take off and head towards the main spaceport of <planet>.`
	"CN-5465" `As you land, a heavily modified Firebird with oversized guns follows you down, settling on the pad next to you. A young man with short hair steps out, walks over to your ship, and says, "Hey, you've got a lot of cargo space there. I bet you make loads of dough with it, trading or running jobs. Say, I know somebody who could use a ship like yours. He needs to get <tons> of cargo to <destination> by <day>, you see. Payment's about 350,000 credits. Lot of pirates round there, though. I can fight 'em, but there's not much money to be made hauling cargo in this thing." He gestures to his ship. "Tell you what, for 20% of the payment, I'll see to it that you arrive there safely. What do you think?"`
	"CN-5466" `	"Sounds like a plan. You'll be taking 70,000 credits, then?"`
	"CN-5467" `	"Sorry, that just sounds too dangerous for me."`
	"CN-5468" `	"That's right. Now, let's go! The cargo'll be loaded on your ship by sundown. Oh, and if you didn't already know, you can get to <planet> from here in just four jumps. North, west, southwest, then south."`
	"CN-5469" `You're looking at some job listings when a man with a harried face approaches you, carrying a package.`
	"CN-5470" `	"Excuse me, Captain," he says. "I need this package delivered in the next four days. Details are on the package. I'll pay you <payment> once it's done." Without waiting for a response, he shoves the package into your hands and runs off to attend to whatever business has gotten him in such a hurry. The package is addressed to a location on <planet>.`
	"CN-5471" `	It's going to be close to his deadline, but it's possible.`
	"CN-5472" `	How he expects you to deliver that package in four days is beyond you, seeing as <planet> is not within three jumps of <origin>, but you might as well try and get there as soon as possible.`
	"CN-5473" `	(Deliver the package.)`
	"CN-5474" `	(Find another pilot to give the package to.)`
	"CN-5475" `	You take the package to your ship, leave it in the cargo bay, and prepare for the flight to <planet>.`
	"CN-5476" `	It takes a while searching for a pilot who can handle the delivery, but you do eventually find one. You hand them the package, explain the situation, thank them, and leave.`
	"CN-5477" `Barely making the deadline, you take the package to the post office in <origin>'s spaceport. The service clerk immediately lets out a sigh of frustration before setting the package down on the counter in front of you.`
	"CN-5478" `Despite missing the deadline, you take the package to the post office in <origin>'s spaceport. The service clerk immediately lets out a sigh of frustration before setting the package down on the counter in front of you.`
	"CN-5479" `	"I'm sorry, but we can't take this package," they say.`
	"CN-5480" `	"What do you mean? Surely you can."`
	"CN-5481" `	"Again, I'm sorry, but we can't send the package," they reiterate. "It's got an incorrect address.`
	"CN-5482" `	"This package is addressed to 2081 Amethyst Avenue, Mercury City, <origin>. Mercury City is <planet>'s capital. Y'know, that planet out east in Algol. Syndicate space. Not a place on <origin>. The package was posted to the wrong planet."`
	"CN-5483" `	"Oh," you say.`
	"CN-5484" `	"I've lost count of how many times this has happened just this month. <origin>, <planet>, I wonder what's the difference! At this point, I don't know why no one's started to regularly meet with <planet>'s postmaster to exchange all this wrongly-posted mail. Alright, here's a word of advice: I highly recommend you take a picture of the incorrect address. I've had plenty of captains get put on blast 'cause of an error the sender made. Not your fault it got addressed to the wrong planet."`
	"CN-5485" `	You thank the clerk and take the package back to your ship.`
	"CN-5486" `	(Take a picture of the incorrect address.)`
	"CN-5487" `	(Don't bother taking a picture.)`
	"CN-5488" `	You take a few photographs of the address label, just to be sure that you've got a clear picture of the wrong address.`
	"CN-5489" `When you talk to a post officer in <planet>'s spaceport and point out the incorrect address before handing it over, you note that he exhibits the same frustration the clerk on <origin> did regarding the frequent switch-ups. He takes the package, muttering something about off-worlders "not knowing the difference even if it smacked 'em in the face" as he did.`
	"CN-5490" `	Once you return to your ship, you notice that the man who gave you that package had sent you a message. Or, to be more precise, a series of messages. An angry series of messages.`
	"CN-5491" `	"WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG???"`
	"CN-5492" `	"I NEEDED THAT DELIVERED DAYS AGO!!!"`
	"CN-5493" `	You send the man the picture you took of his error and point out that it was his mistake that got the package sent to the wrong place. You politely inform him that, had he wanted a smoother delivery, he should've filed a proper job listing and made sure that he placed the correct address.`
	"CN-5494" `	He doesn't respond.`
	"CN-5495" `	He sees the message, but doesn't send a reply. Just before you walk away from your ship's terminal, you see a new message appear:`
	"CN-5496" `	"I am so sorry."`
	"CN-5497" `	The man then proceeds to apologize profusely for his mistake and his outburst, offering to pay an extra 5,000 credits for the trouble. You gladly accept.`
	"CN-5498" `	You try to defend yourself, but the man remains adamant that it was your mistake that got the package sent so late. After a frustrating back-and-forth, you decide to relent and (reluctantly) offer an apology. He ignores it and threatens to get spaceport authorities to "STOP OFFERING JOBS TO INCOMPETENTS LIKE YOU."`
	"CN-5499" `	You don't bother to reply.`
	"CN-5500" `As you walk through <origin>'s spaceport, somebody wearing office attire and carrying a tablet power walks up to you after ending a hurried conversation with another pilot.`
	"CN-5501" `	"Captain! I work for the postmaster's office. The regular pilot who carries misposted mail to <planet> and back couldn't make it this month - some mechanical issues with his ship, I'm told. Would you be willing to carry this month's load there by <day> and then return with the mail from <planet>? We'll pay you what he'd be paid: <payment>."`
	"CN-5502" `	"Oh, so you guys did set up that regular shipment after all!"`
	"CN-5503" `	"Sure, how much mail are we talking about?"`
	"CN-5504" `	"Sorry, but I'm not heading in that direction."`
	"CN-5505" `	The mail employee appears confused for a moment, leaning his head to the side slightly.`
	"CN-5506" `	"I once delivered a misposted package like that, and the clerk mentioned that it happened so often somebody should set up a regular delivery."`
	"CN-5507" `	"Never mind. What's the size of the shipment?"`
	"CN-5508" `	The post employee smiles and responds, "Oh! That was me, actually, back when I worked as a clerk for the post office. I was sick of always having that same conversation with so many pilots a day, so I went out and found a captain to set up a regular delivery with and made the proposal to my boss, who was just as sick of my and the <planet> postmaster's endless reports. Got a bonus and promotion for it; I'm now responsible for the delivery's management, instead! Anyways, are you interested in covering for them?"`
	"CN-5509" `	"Yeah, what's the size of the shipment?"`
	"CN-5510" `	"Sorry, but I'm not able to work that into my plans."`
	"CN-5511" `	The man takes a look at his tablet and says, "This week, it totaled... <tons> of letters and miscellaneous packages here, and then 29 tons to be brought back from Quicksilver."`
	"CN-5512" `	"<tons> of misposted packages? Just this month?!" you ask.`
	"CN-5513" `	He nods. "Told you it happened often. And only a few of these packages even weigh over a kilo! Big shipments hardly get misposted; it's mostly private citizens who make these kinds of mistakes. Mostly. You'd be amazed!"`
	"CN-5514" `	You two shake hands and arrange for the misposted packages to be loaded onto the <ship>. Time to head to <planet>.`
	"CN-5515" `	The mail employee thanks you for your time, and continues his search for a willing captain. At least pilots that get hired to deliver such wrongly-posted packages, like you once did, won't have to finish those deliveries themselves in the future.`
	"CN-5516" `You're signing the standard Syndicate landing papers with an officer on <origin>. "Everything seems to be in order. And of course, we'll have your ship refueled promptly. Have a good day, Captain <last>." He nods his head at you and starts to move off towards the next ship.`
	"CN-5517" `	Before he can make it there, you hear a commotion by the <npc>, the <npc model> on the landing pad next to you.`
	"CN-5518" `	(Turn around to see what's going on.)`
	"CN-5519" `	(Ignore the commotion.)`
	"CN-5520" `	Both of you turn your heads towards the <npc> to see what's happening, but as you do you hear the deafening blare of warning sirens through <origin>'s spaceport; at the same time, the <npc> suddenly jolts up with its loading ramp still extended.`
	"CN-5521" `	You turn back towards the <ship> only to hear the deafening blares of warning sirens through <origin>'s spaceport. Looking around instinctively, you notice the <npc> jolting up with its loading ramp still extended.`
	"CN-5522" `	"Hey, what's going on here?" the officer tries to shout over the noise of the sirens and the repulsors, but the rogue <npc model> veers rapidly and uncertainly towards you and the officer.`
	"CN-5523" `	(Jump for cover.)`
	"CN-5524" `	(Take a shot at the <npc model> with my sidearm.)`
	"CN-5525" `	Both of you barely jump down for cover before the ship clips a stack of cargo crates, sending them flying into the refueling platform. The Quad Blaster Turret mounted on the top of the <npc model> swivels around aimlessly, then fires without warning, its energy bolts scattering some of the startled onlookers nearby and sending up debris where they hit the ground. It comes dangerously close to colliding with the <ship> before it veers off to the side and sends its repulsors into full thrust, fleeing away into the sky.`
	"CN-5526" `	You fire a shot right at the cockpit with your pistol but the shot is absorbed by the <npc model>'s shield matrix, rendering it useless. The <npc> flies right over you, sending you backwards and into the ground.`
	"CN-5527" `	You prop yourself up to hear the <npc model>'s Quad Blaster Turret fire aimlessly around the spaceport, shortly replaced by the sounds of its repulsors being sent up to full thrust. By the time you get up, the <npc> has already started fleeing off into the sky.`
	"CN-5528" `	The Syndicated Security officer, dazed and coated in dust kicked up from the unpermitted departure, only just pulls himself up before another person runs up to accost him. "Oi, those kids, they just hijacked my <npc model>! Get someone on their tail!"`
	"CN-5529" `	"I'll do it!"`
	"CN-5530" `	(Let Syndicated Security deal with it.)`
	"CN-5531" `	The captain of the stolen <npc model> turns towards you. "Thank you, Captain! Don't destroy the <npc>, I'm already late for my bloody contract. Agh, this doesn't help at all," he mutters to himself.`
	"CN-5532" `	The officer looks back at you, having dusted himself off and regained his senses. "Yes, go and deal with his ship now. Don't board it, we'll have Syndicated Security ships come after you to board the hijacked ship and tug it down. Go!"`
	"CN-5533" `	You run towards the <ship> and take off after the hijacked <npc>...`
	"CN-5534" `	The officer, slightly flustered, calls for a small squadron of Syndicated Security ships to chase the hijacked <npc>, then runs off to one of <origin>'s spaceport terminals to file the paperwork with the captain.`
	"CN-5535" `You've landed without disabling the <npc>. It's probably gone now, but you might want to report to its captain.`
	"CN-5536" `	(Find the captain.)`
	"CN-5537" `	(Don't worry about it.)`
	"CN-5538" `	You find him in the spaceport lounge. As you walk in, he recognizes you and calls you over. "How are you doing? Did you recover the <npc>?"`
	"CN-5539" `	"No, I wasn't able to."`
	"CN-5540" `	"It fled before I could disable it."`
	"CN-5541" `	"I blew it up, just like you wanted."`
	"CN-5542" `	He frowns at this and lets out a sigh. "Well, I'll contact security and let them deal with this. Don't worry, they'll sort it out. But thanks for getting back to me about it." He walks off towards the Syndicated Security offices.`
	"CN-5543" `	He jolts his head back. "What'd you say?"`
	"CN-5544" `	"Yeah, I blew it up."`
	"CN-5545" `	"The hijackers got away, sorry."`
	"CN-5546" `	He sighs and says, "Man, I don't have time for this. Tell me what actually happened."`
	"CN-5547" `	"I blew it up, didn't you hear me?"`
	"CN-5548" `	"Your ship got away. That's what happened."`
	"CN-5549" `	"If you're going to waste my time, get out of here." Before you can react, he storms off towards the Syndicated Security offices.`
	"CN-5550" `When you land, the captain of the <npc> comes up to you, his face rather red.`
	"CN-5551" `	He grabs your shoulders and shakes you hard, shouting, "Didn't I tell you not to board my ship? Do you know how many credits I've just lost because of you?"`
	"CN-5552" `	"I'm sorry, I was just trying to help!"`
	"CN-5553" `	"I'm sure whatever you lost wasn't worth all that much."`
	"CN-5554" `	He stops shaking you for a moment to say, "Well, you didn't need to shoot up the insides of my <npc model> while you were trying to help, weren't you? Fat lot of help that was, even if you tried to do the right thing. Oh, well..."`
	"CN-5555" `	The captain lets you go with a push and turns around to walk off towards the direction of the bar, leaving you to contemplate your actions.`
	"CN-5556" `	He grabs your shoulders and shakes you hard, shouting, "Didn't I tell you not to destroy my ship? Do you know how many credits I've just lost because of you?"`
	"CN-5557" `	He stops shaking you for a moment to say, "Well, you shouldn't have blown up my <npc model> while you were trying to help, weren't you? Fat lot of help that was, even if you tried to do the right thing. Oh, well..."`
	"CN-5558" `	He looks at you incredulously, scrunching up his face. "Not--not that much? Is that what you just said?" He pauses for a moment to look at the wall above you with a lost look in his eyes. "That was my life's work up there, an <npc model> that had served me for 14 years, and you have the audacity to say it was all for nothing?!"`
	"CN-5559" `	"Well, yeah."`
	"CN-5560" `	"No, that's not what I meant."`
	"CN-5561" `	The captain scoffs, staring you down again with even more intensity than before, and lets you go with a rough push. "I don't need your explanation, and I don't think you could give me one. I just can't understand how you can walk away feeling alright that you've set back one man's life so much."`
	"CN-5562" `	Suddenly, he turns around and walks off towards the direction of the bar, leaving you to contemplate your actions.`
	"CN-5563" `As you land, Syndicated Security have the <npc> in tow, escorted by a trio of Quicksilvers. The formation lands on one of the larger pads reserved for Syndicated Security vessels, fenced off from the rest of the spaceport.`
	"CN-5564" `	The hijackers, just a raucous group of young kids, are hauled out of the <npc model> by Syndicated Security personnel towards an armored van. Multiple times the kids try to run away, but after a few minutes they're finally detained; the van drives off towards the spaceport terminal.`
	"CN-5565" `	After the incident is wrapped up, the captain of the <npc> sends you <payment>, and a message thanking you for helping him recover his ship.`
	"CN-5566" `As you walk through <origin>'s cramped new planetary spaceport, you see a middle-aged man on the other side of the corridor, behind a column of people. He sits on a bench with a suitcase at his side, doing nothing particular aside from the occasional tap of his cane when someone passes by.`
	"CN-5567" `	(Go up to him.)`
	"CN-5568" `	Wading through the mix of passengers, stevedores, and captains in the overflowing corridor, you reach the man with the cane. It's obvious now that he's blind; he doesn't move to look at you and continues looking straight ahead, but he taps his cane twice when you come by him.`
	"CN-5569" `	"Hello."`
	"CN-5570" `	"Are you alright?"`
	"CN-5571" `	(Never mind.)`
	"CN-5572" `	"Yes, hello, how are you doing?" the man responds, shifting his head toward your direction. "I'm here waiting for someone to pick me up," he says in a voice that sounds like he expects it at any moment.`
	"CN-5573" `	"Are they far away?"`
	"CN-5574" `	"Who is it you're looking for?"`
	"CN-5575" `	"Where is she?"`
	"CN-5576" `	"I see. Safe travels to you." (Walk away.)`
	"CN-5577" `	"Well, I suppose you could say that they are far away, or they could be right here. I don't know." He taps his cane twice more.`
	"CN-5578" `	"Someone to take me to my daughter, Anita." Yet again, his cane taps twice.`
	"CN-5579" `	He looks over to his side, as if he feels reserved about something. "She's on <planet>, getting some experimental treatment from the University of New Sydney. I want to be by her side if anything goes wrong, to tell her that I'm there for her, that I love her, and that everything will be okay. She's been waiting for the treatment for so long now. And since nobody else seems to have arrived here yet, I hope you'll be the one to take me there."`
	"CN-5580" `	"Of course, I can take you to <planet>."`
	"CN-5581" `	"Sorry, I won't be able to."`
	"CN-5582" `	The man musters a broad smile, says "Thank you all too much. Would you like to help me with the luggage?" He scans the floor with his cane for it. Later, while boarding, he tells you his name is Douglas Pears, and he promises to you <payment> for transporting him.`
	"CN-5583" `	"Then I will wait until another comes to help me." The blind man taps his cane once more, then returns to looking straight ahead.`
	"CN-5584" `Throughout the trip, Douglas has been relatively quiet and has kept to himself. When you land, he lets you help him bring down his luggage once more; it turns out you needn't have done so because an attendant from the planetary spaceport quickly comes to his side. He guides both of you to the spaceport's intracity transit complex; the bustling spaceport makes it a challenge to keep together, but all of you manage to reach it. From there, you hail a taxi while Douglas arranges for the <payment> to be sent to you.`
	"CN-5585" `	"Well, I must go now to the University of New Sydney. They and my daughter are expecting me at their Health Sciences quarter."`
	"CN-5586" `	"Goodbye."`
	"CN-5587" `	"I hope your daughter has a safe recovery."`
	"CN-5588" `	"Everything is going to be alright."`
	"CN-5589" `	"Could I come with you?"`
	"CN-5590" `	"Bye, now. I wish you greater luck in your travels and your sights." With that, he taps his cane twice, and then steps into one of New Sydney's taxis, going toward the University of New Sydney campus on the far side of town.`
	"CN-5591" `	"Yes, thank you so much. I hope so too, of course; actually, it's a little foolish saying that, of course I do. But now I have to go. Again, thank you for making this journey possible."`
	"CN-5592" `	Douglas looks taken aback for a moment, but says, "Well, I suppose you can come along. I'm not sure if the university would let you in, though. But I think Anita would like to meet you, or at least say hello." You get into the taxi with him, and it starts toward New Sydney's University District.`
	"CN-5593" `	"How did you become blind?"`
	"CN-5594" `	"How did becoming blind change your life?"`
	"CN-5595" `	"How do you feel about the atomic bombings?"`
	"CN-5596" `	"Was your daughter caught in the atomic bombings?"`
	"CN-5597" `	"What happened to your daughter?"`
	"CN-5598" `	"It was the fourth of July, 3014. I was in my office, on one of the high rises on the outskirts of the capital, with my office window pointed right at the city center." He turns to look out the window, as if he knew New Sydney's skyline was out there where he couldn't see. In the small lull, he takes an audible breath.`
	"CN-5599" `	"It was a beautiful day that day. I... I remember that Pollux was especially bright and colorful that day, and the songbirds that inhabited the city were alive with sound. They were unusually so. It was very vivid, very strange. Maybe I should have listened to the birds...`
	"CN-5600" `	"But when the bomb dropped, I was looking right at it, from my office window. All I could remember next was that I was in a lot of pain, that I couldn't see, but one of my colleagues - thank goodness for her - found me afterwards, during the evacuation, covered in glass from the shockwave. I survived mostly because I was sitting at my terminal and that protected me from the bulk of the shards."`
	"CN-5601" `	"Hmm... well, it was really only one of many things that hit my life then, not least of which was my newfound blindness, and the loss of my company and my job." He gives a heavy sigh, and he shifts in his seat as if something heavy was placed on his shoulders. "I was able to keep things intact for a while, but no, it was too much. Anything can be taken away from you if you get too used to it."`
	"CN-5602" `	"How do I feel about the bombings? Well, they changed everything. In some ways I'm very grateful that it showed - no, it exposed to me, that people, they- there's people that live this way. With no sight. Who need other people to help them just... live. And that there are plenty of people who don't have people to help them live. I was lucky, I could get treatment for my blindness. But others, no...`
	"CN-5603" `	"And for the bombings themselves, they were certainly a malicious act. The Syndicate needs to take full accountability for it, not only for the people who were killed or affected in some form or another. I'm too cynical to say that they will, with all the power they still have in Parliament."`
	"CN-5604" `	"And for the bombings themselves, they were certainly a malicious act. I hear the authorities are still investigating the bombings, although it's very curious that Korban, the CEO of the Syndicate, resigned as soon as the Republic started poking their heads that way. I'm still not sure who's responsible for the bombings, the deaths, the war... I can only hope the investigation will be thorough."`
	"CN-5605" `	"Luckily, my daughter was off-planet during the bombings. Anita was studying nanoengineering on Vinci and was going to apply for a job at Polymath there. But she gave that up to come take care of me after the bombings. When things were more ironed over, it was the midst of the civil war, and she managed to go back to Vinci and work at Polymath then, but... well, she has not been well since then."`
	"CN-5606" `	"I don't know if I really should tell you this, but Anita was working on a project on nanomachines at Polymath when she got back. She was, uh... infected by them by accident. The experimental treatment is meant to try and eliminate the rogue machines, but since they're so small... that's why the treatment is experimental."`
	"CN-5607" `	Deciding not to ask Douglas anything, you look out the windows of the taxi. You're in the midst of New Sydney, and skyscrapers stare down at your tiny taxi from each side of the avenue, but despite this it is still quite green and cheery, with trees on each side and people walking to work in the morning.`
	"CN-5608" `	As the taxi drives on a highway on the edge of a small hill, the window gives you a panorama of the suburbs of New Sydney and the two skylines on each side, one marking the commercial sector where the spaceport is prominent in its gleaming steel-glass architecture, and the other being the University District, a series of clean and white, flowing buildings and skyscrapers. Far away on the horizon, you can barely notice the smokestacks of factories.`
	"CN-5609" `	The taxi enters the University district proper now, and the window shows thongs of energetic university students from the University of New Sydney travelling to and from lectures and classrooms; going over steel walkways that run from building to building above you, and on footpaths beside the streets; clutching their backpacks and data pads. Your datapad shows that University isn't actually the only university district in New Sydney. The University of Chiron's campus is on the other side of town, presumably to keep the fierce competition between the two institutions from boiling over each other.`
	"CN-5610" `	Eventually, the taxi passes by a sign for the "UNS Health Sciences" quarter, which by the looks of it takes up an entire section of the University District. The taxi pulls up beside the entrance of the university hospital, where you help Douglas out with his luggage. The building is stark from the outside, to match the architecture of the surroundings, yet strangely colorful on the inside, as if the person building it decided that hospital interiors were far too unimaginative.`
	"CN-5611" `	After a short queue, you reach the reception with Douglas. The receptionist, placed behind a sterile-looking screen that looks far out of place with the colorful hallways, asks with a well-practiced smile, "How may I help you?"`
	"CN-5612" `	"We're looking for Anita Pears. Where can we find her?"`
	"CN-5613" `	For a moment, the receptionist shuffles information around on her terminal. "Is one of you a parent?"`
	"CN-5614" `	"I'm the father, Douglas Pears," he replies.`
	"CN-5615" `	She takes a few more seconds before looking at you and saying, "Ah, but we cannot let you in. Only Mr. Pears is booked in for his daughter's procedure; we have a family-only policy, to keep the privacy of our patients."`
	"CN-5616" `	"Alright."`
	"CN-5617" `	"Are you sure?"`
	"CN-5618" `	"We can't allow immediate exceptions, sorry. There's nothing I can do."`
	"CN-5619" `	Douglas gives you a compassionate look, and says to the receptionist, "There'll be no worry." He turns back to you once more and says, "I'm sure that when Anita is recovered and well, we can meet again some day. I don't want to keep you from your business too long, either. I expect ship captains are busy folk." He comes up to you and, to your surprise, gives you a hug. "Thank you so much for bringing me here and coming along with me. I really can't say how I want to express my gratitude. But I hope we meet again. Farewell."`
	"CN-5620" `	"Farewell to you too."`
	"CN-5621" `	With that, he grabs his cane and his luggage, and follows a hospital attendant toward his daughter's room, leaving you in the reception.`
	"CN-5622" `Among the bustle of the spaceport, one figure catches your attention. A woman stands alone on one side of the passageway with a bubble of space around her that is maintained by sheer force of personality. She doesn't seem to be saying anything, at least. As you get closer, you notice a large package at her feet. Something about you catches her attention, and she looks you in the eye and beckons.`
	"CN-5623" `	(Go over to her.)`
	"CN-5624" `	You make your way through the crowd to the edge of her bubble. As soon as you do, she extends her hand. "I'm Torrey. Torrey Dupont."`
	"CN-5625" `	You take the hand and shake it. "<first> <last>."`
	"CN-5626" `	"I can tell you're an independent captain. I would like to hire you to transport a package." Torrey indicates the box beside her with a nudge of her toe.`
	"CN-5627" `	"What's in the box?"`
	"CN-5628" `	"Why can't you send it via the job board?"`
	"CN-5629" `	She glances down at it. "It's nothing too special - some local stuff from around here. Mostly foods and things that you just can't get made the same anywhere else."`
	"CN-5630" `	"Why can't you send it via the job board?" you ask.`
	"CN-5631" `	Torrey gives a sardonic smile. "Well, yes; the thing is, I'm sending it to a friend who's an NCO in the militia for the Southern Mutual Defense Pact. Normally, of course, that would be fine, but... then there's who I am." She reaches into a pocket and pulls out a piece of paper - a printout of a news headline. "Protests Block Access To Council Chambers For Fourth Straight Day." Underneath the headline is a picture of Torrey holding up a sign decrying recent actions by the government.`
	"CN-5632" `	"So you see," she continues, "I'm already being watched by the Republic government. What with the rumors lately, I really don't want to do anything that would throw any suspicion onto Irene, but..." She glances down at the box. "She's really been missing some of the stuff from home, and I don't want to make her life less pleasant because of what I've been doing."`
	"CN-5633" `	"All right; I'll deliver the package."`
	"CN-5634" `	"I don't support those protests, or the people who participate in them."`
	"CN-5635" `	"If you're being watched, then I might get in trouble too. Sorry."`
	"CN-5636" `	Torrey grimaces, but nods. "That's understandable. Well, have a good day, then." She turns back to looking out at the passing crowds, and you head back on your way.`
	"CN-5637" `	Torrey breaks out into a brilliant grin. "Well, that's great news, then. You'll find Irene at the militia base on <destination> - that's Gunnery Sergeant Irene Brower. I do appreciate this. You'll be paid upon receipt of the package, too, lest you think my appreciation is all I can give."`
	"CN-5638" `	She picks up the package and hands it to you; it's surprisingly heavy, but doesn't seem to shift or rattle at all as you settle it in your arms to carry to your ship.`
	"CN-5639" `You arrive at the militia base on <destination>, and ask at the gate for Gunnery Sergeant Irene Brower. After a few minutes, a compact young woman with close-cropped blonde hair appears and walks over. When she sees the package at your feet, her face splits into a lopsided grin and her steps quicken. "I see you've brought me a package; this must be from Torrey! She said she was sending something."`
	"CN-5640" `	You nod, introduce yourself, and briefly recount your meeting with her friend on <origin>. Irene laughs. "Yep, that's her. Well, thank you so much for bringing this." She hefts the heavy box with no apparent effort, gives you a firm nod, and turns to head back into the base.`
	"CN-5641" `	Before going more than three steps, she stops and turns back to you. "Oh, sorry - I'll authorize your payment as soon as I get back to my room. I don't have it with me."`
	"CN-5642" `	Sure enough, less than five minutes later, your communicator bleeps and reports that <payment> have been credited to your account.`
	"CN-5643" `As you step out of your ship, you spot a familiar face: Irene Brower, the gunnery sergeant you delivered a care package to before the war, though she seems to have master sergeant insignia now. She's on crutches, with what looks like a brand-new prosthetic leg. When she spots you, her pained face brightens. "Hey, I know you! You brought me that package from Tor before. Thanks!" She shifts her weight, then winces and shifts it back.`
	"CN-5644" `	She notices you looking at her leg, and grins lopsidedly. "Yeah. My CO thought it was a good idea to follow Voigt's plan to suppress the pirates on Greenrock. To be honest, I agreed with him at the time." She pauses a moment. "Now, not so sure, and not just because a blown-out shield capacitor lost me a leg. I heard what happened on Thule, both the good and the bad of it."`
	"CN-5645" `	"I'm so sorry for your loss."`
	"CN-5646" `	"So... that prosthetic is very new, then?"`
	"CN-5647" `	"With that prosthetic, soon you'll have a leg up on the rest of us, eh?"`
	"CN-5648" `	She grins broadly at your pun. "Yep! Just here to get a float chair for the first few weeks of adjustment."`
	"CN-5649" `	She waves it off, but her face softens. "Thanks. I'm here to pick up a float chair, for the first six weeks of adjustment."`
	"CN-5650" `	She nods. "Yep, just came from getting it fitted, and gotta check in at the quartermaster's to get myself a float chair for the first six weeks of adjustment to it."`
	"CN-5651" `	"Six months of medical leave, then I'll be back in action. And hopefully assigned to ships a little less eager to jump into the thick of it when it's not really necessary, eh?"`
	"CN-5652" `	You join in her wry chuckle, then she gives you a wave with one crutch and bids you farewell.`
	"CN-5653" `While wandering the <origin> spaceport, waiting for your ship to be refueled, you notice a commotion near one of the other hangars; someone appears to be shouting. As you approach the disturbance, you see a well-dressed older man engaged in a heated discussion with a Navy officer beside a parked Frigate being loaded with supplies. After a few more shouts and a dismissive wave by the officer, the man turns away, exasperated - then spots you and walks over.`
	"CN-5654" `	"You," the man says, "you're an independent captain, aren't you? You take jobs for credits?" He winces a little bit after he says it, maybe a little embarrassed by his bluntness.`
	"CN-5655" `	"I'm Captain <last>, and yes, I do."`
	"CN-5656" `	"It depends on the job."`
	"CN-5657" `	"Oh. That's good to hear. I'm sorry for being so brusque with you - my daughter's ship has gone missing. She's a racing pilot, the best to come out of the Paradise Worlds three times over. It's got to be foul play: pirates or a jealous competitor. That's what I told that useless Navy woman, that they've got to put out a search, but she says that she has to have authorization..." He pauses for a moment, realizing he's gone off-track.`
	"CN-5658" `	He sighs. "It's search-and-rescue; my daughter's ship has gone missing. She's a racing pilot, the best to come out of the Paradise Worlds three times over. It's got to be foul play: pirates or a jealous competitor. That's what I told that useless Navy woman, that they've got to put out a search, but she says that she has to have authorization..." He pauses for a moment, realizing he's gone off-track.`
	"CN-5659" `	"Again, I'm sorry. You don't need to hear all that. The loop was through Mirfak. I just need to know if you can take me to <planet> and scan for her transponder in those uninhabited systems north of there. Money is no object."`
	"CN-5660" `	"I'd be happy to help."`
	"CN-5661" `	"I'm sorry, but I can't transport you. You'll have to find another captain."`
	"CN-5662" `	A flicker of emotions crosses the man's face: anger, scorn, resignation. "I thought you'd be better than those Navy bastards," he says, shaking his head. "Well, I hope I can find someone in this place with a shred of decency before she dies out there." He walks away, his disappointment heavy in the air.`
	"CN-5663" `	The man exhales, relieved. "Thank you so much," he says. "My name is August Renard, and my daughter is Artemis. She's out there, I know it, but we'd better get moving soon."`
	"CN-5664" `	"My ship is as fast as they come. We'll find her in no time."`
	"CN-5665" `	"Artemis Renard? I think I heard she won something recently... maybe in Betelgeuse?"`
	"CN-5666" `	"Ah, yes," the man says with pride in his voice. "The Betelgeuse Classic. Contestants run a circuit of every planet and major moon in the system and hit every marker in an equatorial orbit without refueling. They've been doing it since the Firebird was new, and no one's done it faster than my daughter - no one. She's the best; that's how I know something's gone wrong. Tell your people to warm up the engines."`
	"CN-5667" `	"I appreciate your pride in your ship. I've heard 'fast as they come' for twenty years now, and I've never needed it more than today."`
	"CN-5668" `	You lead Mr. Renard to your ship, which he boards with unusual nimbleness and comfort for an old man from the Paradise Worlds.`
	"CN-5669" `You were unable to find Artemis Renard in any of the three uninhabited systems, and you have watched hope fade into desperation in her father with each successive failure. You can't imagine he's been getting much sleep.`
	"CN-5670" `	During the landing on <origin>, you notice that there is a great deal of race infrastructure still in place around the planet and spaceport: large camera drones remain in low orbit, and the spaceport is filled with a variety of ships in racing livery. A mostly depleted Navy contingent remains, empty areas testifying to the ongoing hunt, while the few remaining officers interview racers, organizers, and spectators. The spaceport seems busier and more hectic than usual.`
	"CN-5671" `	"I've got to speak with the race coordinators here," says Mr. Renard, striding towards the marshal station. "I see the marshals are back from searching. Syndicate idiots, probably didn't even notice she was missing 'til it was on the news. We've got to keep looking. Will you meet me back here in the spaceport in an hour or two? I'll double your fee."`
	"CN-5672" `	"Of course. We're going to find her."`
	"CN-5673" `	"I'm sorry, but I can't help any more."`
	"CN-5674" `	"Fine," he says, "then take your money." He slams a credit chip for <payment> in your hand and storms off into the spaceport, on the verge of tears.`
	"CN-5675" `	Much later, you receive a request to take him to Glory.`
	"CN-5676" `	"You're a saint for this," he says, and hands you a credit chip for <payment>. "We have to find her.`
	"CN-5677" `	"Meet me in the spaceport in a couple of hours. I want to look for clues."`
	"CN-5678" `	When you meet August Renard, he looks no better than when he left the <ship>. However, he does manage to speak. "Please take me to <planet>, captain. It's better to lead the search remotely from there than deal with these people in person."`
	"CN-5679" `	"I guess."`
	"CN-5680" `	"Sorry. You'll have to find another captain."`
	"CN-5681" `As the advanced medical facilities of <planet> rise up to greet the <ship>, August comes to meet you on the bridge. "Captain, I would like to thank you for attempting to find my daughter, even though the attempt ended poorly. Thank you for that, at least." He then prepares to exit the ship, outside of which a veritable army of attendants are waiting.`
	"CN-5682" `	"Weren't you going to pay me?"`
	"CN-5683" `	(Leave him alone.)`
	"CN-5684" `	August is escorted to a Shuttle which has just landed on the pad next to the <ship>, waves to you as he goes in, and launches to another part of the planet.`
	"CN-5685" `	August turns. "What! After what you've done, crashed my hopes, you expect me to pay you! Why would you think that? Fine!" He throws a credit chip at you and exits the <ship> in a huff.`
	"CN-5686" `	When you access the credit chip, you find it is only worth <payment>.`
	"CN-5687" `The displays in the spaceport hangar flicker with a news broadcast: sweeping aerial views of the spaceport alongside photos of Artemis Renard beside her red-and-white Flivver, wearing a calm, confident expression. Beneath the images, the screen reads "CORE CHAMPIONSHIP CATASTROPHE: MISSING MISS RENARD MYSTIFIES MILLIONS."`
	"CN-5688" `	(Watch the news broadcast.)`
	"CN-5689" `	(Wait for Mr. Renard to return.)`
	"CN-5690" `	The voice of an eerily calm anchor plays over more vignettes of the race infrastructure. "... and, of course, today's top story: three-time Centurion-Division, Paradise Circuit racing champion Artemis Renard has been officially declared 'missing' after she did not return here to Sunracer after this year's Megaparsec Core Championship. The search effort has been ongoing for days now, led by Megaparsec with support from the Republic Navy and Syndicated Security. The head of the event, Quinn Emerson, put out the following statement:`
	"CN-5691" `	"'We at Megaparsec put the greatest attention into ensuring the safety and well-being of all our event participants and guests. Over the past forty-eight hours, our search teams have fully scanned the Volax, Cardax, Moktar, Bellatrix, and Menkar systems, and we are working in conjunction with the Republic and Syndicate to fully scour their territories belonging to the circuit as well. Ms. Renard's family can rest assured that if she's out there, we'll find her.'`
	"CN-5692" `	"'Artemis Renard, daughter of terraforming magnates August and Louisa Renard, is perhaps best known for shattering the record for the Betelgeuse Classic in last year's race, crossing the finish line nearly fifteen minutes faster than the record set by Jackson Lee over twenty years ago. She was last seen flying her ship, the Moonfox, a white and red Lionheart Flivver with race registration B-168, in the Diphda system. Anyone with information regarding her whereabouts is encouraged to contact Syndicate or Navy authorities, as well as the Megaparsec Racing Events Commission, and may be entitled to monetary reward if such information leads to the retrieval of Ms. Renard or her ship.'"`
	"CN-5693" `	The broadcast then ends, going to an advertisement for the Megaparsec Splinter.`
	"CN-5694" `	Several minutes later, you see Mr. Renard returning from the terminal side of the spaceport, looking frustrated. "Idiots!" he shouts. "They couldn't find their legs in a dressing room! They tell me that they had 'some network and monitoring issues' and that they don't have surveillance for the entire last leg of the race. I told Artemis to never trust these Syndicate amateurs."`
	"CN-5695" `	"I'm sure they're trying their best."`
	"CN-5696" `	"'Network and monitoring issues' sounds suspicious."`
	"CN-5697" `	"Do you have a plan for where to go next?"`
	"CN-5698" `	"Well their best isn't very good, is it! They don't notice that their number-one pilot has been missing for days? I'll get the best lawyers in the Republic to drag Megaparsec through court 'till the only thing left they'll be able to sell is scrap!"`
	"CN-5699" `	"What you said about 'network and monitoring issues' sounded suspicious."`
	"CN-5700" `	"So what's the plan from here?"`
	"CN-5701" `	Mr. Renard suddenly speaks more quietly. "I thought so too. I think it might have been sabotage."`
	"CN-5702" `	"Every day that Artemis is lost, the odds on her plummet and the bets on her competitors skyrocket. I've spent enough time making money to know that there's no faster way to bruise a competitor than scandal. I think someone sabotaged the race and went after my daughter because they knew it would make headlines, and they knew they could cash in by betting on underdogs."`
	"CN-5703" `	"Who do you think did it?"`
	"CN-5704" `	"I'm not sure I'm convinced. Couldn't she just have crashed?"`
	"CN-5705" `	Mr. Renard scoffs. "She's been named the best racing pilot in the Republic three times! She didn't just crash."`
	"CN-5706" `	"Fair enough. So if this was sabotage, who do you think did it?"`
	"CN-5707" `	"I didn't mean to cast doubt on her skill; I just meant that I'm not sure this has to be a conspiracy."`
	"CN-5708" `	"I'm not sure," Mr. Renard says, "Maybe the Syndicate, maybe Betelgeuse or Lionheart. Even an ambitious pirate. Each could benefit from betting on such a high-profile race."`
	"CN-5709" `	"So what's your plan? How are we going to find her?"`
	"CN-5710" `	Mr. Renard sighs. "Maybe not. I just want her back, you know." He pulls out a photo of her, moving it slightly between his fingers so that it is evenly lit; it looks a couple of years younger than the one on the news broadcast. "They said she was last seen in Diphda. If she was going north, as she should have been, then we should keep looking in Acamar. It's an uninhabited system, and with surveillance down, whatever went wrong would have happened long before anyone else even entered the system."`
	"CN-5711" `	"I'll set a course for Acamar."`
	"CN-5712" `	"I'm sorry that this happened, but I'm afraid I can't help."`
	"CN-5713" `	"Then you're just like the rest of those fools!" Mr. Renard stomps off in a rage.`
	"CN-5714" `	"They said she was last seen in Diphda. If she was going north, as she should have been, they probably caught up to her in Acamar. It's an uninhabited system, and with surveillance down, whoever did it could have disabled her ship before any of the other racers entered the system.`
	"CN-5715" `	"Thank you, Captain. We need to get moving immediately."`
	"CN-5716" `Upon entering the Acamar system, your sensors detect a faint radio signal coming from the third planet in the system, but you realize that the radio signal is a result of the electrical discharges from the planet's atmosphere produced by the many volcanoes on the surface. After calibrating your sensors to account for this, you are unable to detect any transponder signal matching Artemis' ship.`
	"CN-5717" `	Mr. Renard paces around the bridge of the <ship>, prodding at consoles. "Are you sure you checked it? Is that the right frequency?"`
	"CN-5718" `	"Is there anywhere else she could be?"`
	"CN-5719" `	"Please calm down."`
	"CN-5720" `	"Calm! Calm? You expect me to be calm? If your daughter was missing would you be calm?"`
	"CN-5721" `	"I'm sorry. Is there anywhere else she could be?"`
	"CN-5722" `	"I'm sure I wouldn't know."`
	"CN-5723" `	(Ignore the question.)`
	"CN-5724" `	August seems to suddenly calm down. "I suppose you wouldn't.`
	"CN-5725" `	"Anyway, I'm not sure if she could even be anywhere else. The route went north from here, up through Elnath and Nihal and then through the uninhabited systems back to Mirfak. But we've checked every one of those systems and haven't seen a signal." He stops for a moment, sitting down and putting his head in his hands. "We should have found her!"`
	"CN-5726" `	"I'm not sure. The route went north from here, up through Elnath and Nihal and then through the uninhabited systems back to Mirfak. But we've checked every one of those systems! We should have seen a signal!" He stops for a moment, sitting down and putting his head in his hands. "We should have found her!"`
	"CN-5727" `	You clear the rest of your crew off the bridge to give him some space.`
	"CN-5728" `	"I suppose I should just give you your money and go home," he rasps.`
	"CN-5729" `	"Perhaps that would be best."`
	"CN-5730" `	(Suggest a different system.)`
	"CN-5731" `	"What about there," you say, pointing to the neighboring system. "Kugel. It's off the circuit, so no one will have searched there, but if her hyperdrive malfunctioned or was sabotaged, she might have ended up there. It's only a single jump away."`
	"CN-5732" `	"Okay," he says, wiping his eyes with the corners of his sleeves. "Kugel it is, Captain."`
	"CN-5733" `	"You're just like all the rest of those captains, don't care about their passengers, only seek to be paid." August Renard sighs. "But, I suppose that is to be expected. If nobody will help, giving up is the only option.`
	"CN-5734" `	"At least take me back to Glory."`
	"CN-5735" `	August turns. "What! After what you've done, crashed my hopes, you expect me to pay you? Why would you think that? Fine!" He throws a credit chip at you and exits the <ship> in a huff.`
	"CN-5736" `Upon reaching the planet, you pinpoint the radio signal to a valley in the southern hemisphere. You descend through a raging sandstorm; you have to rely entirely on instruments as the view from the <ship>'s bridge is almost entirely obscured. Soon, your scanners report that the source of the signal is less than a kilometer out, and after a few moments more, you begin to discern the vague shape of a crashed Flivver through the haze of dust. You land the <ship> next to the wreck, and both you and Mr. Renard go to exit the ship.`
	"CN-5737" `	Visibility is even worse on foot, and while August shouts over the howling wind, you cannot tell what he is saying. As you clear the front part of your own ship, you see the crashed ship before you.`
	"CN-5738" `	Mr. Renard shouts with what you believe to be joy at seeing the parachute and scattered flares. The two of you wade through the sand and increasingly dense scattered debris as quickly as you can until you arrive at the rear hatch of the crashed Flivver. You struggle to turn the lock but eventually force it open, briefly letting the sand-filled air rush into the interior of the ship before you close it behind you. Inside, the ship is dark and depowered but more or less intact. At the front of the craft, sitting in the half-submerged cockpit, is the woman you saw on the broadcast, wiping the sand from her face.`
	"CN-5739" `	"Hmph," she says, somewhat weakly. "I thought you were going to be the Navy."`
	"CN-5740" `	Mr. Renard rushes to her and the two embrace.`
	"CN-5741" `	"And who's this?" Artemis asks.`
	"CN-5742" `	"Captain <first> <last> of the <ship>."`
	"CN-5743" `	"I'm here to get you out of here."`
	"CN-5744" `	"A pilot, eh? I can appreciate that. I'd appreciate it more if you could fly me out of here, though."`
	"CN-5745" `	"My ship is landed outside. Follow me."`
	"CN-5746" `	"I have some questions."`
	"CN-5747" `	Artemis coughs. "Later, okay?"`
	"CN-5748" `	"A real professional, eh? I can appreciate that. I think I'm about ready to get to it, then, if that's all right with you."`
	"CN-5749" `	The three of you exit the crashed Flivver and make the journey back to the <ship>. Artemis stumbles several times but the two of you steady her and eventually make it to your ship's airlock. You wipe the sand from your face and fetch your ship's first aid equipment, but to your surprise upon returning, Artemis seems remarkably uninjured despite the crash.`
	"CN-5750" `	"Oh, shove off, Captain. I'm fine. Automated drogue system in the ship, safety first, spare no expense. Wouldn't mind a visit to your galley, though."`
	"CN-5751" `	"Drogue system? Like parachutes? I hadn't considered that."`
	"CN-5752" `	"Really? What is it with you spacers and 'going down with the ship' anyway?"`
	"CN-5753" `	You don't think you've ever seen someone devour a sleeve of freeze-dried peas as quickly or with as much verve as Artemis does. After eating her way through the <ship>'s entire stock of several other varieties of packaged food, she eventually slows down, though the hungry look on her face remains. Her father sits beside her, holding her hand tightly.`
	"CN-5754" `	"I suppose you have some questions," she says, "both of you. Well, I hope you do, at least."`
	"CN-5755" `	"Why did you crash?"`
	"CN-5756" `	"That was a beautiful ship you had there. I've never seen a Flivver quite like that."`
	"CN-5757" `	"I'll leave the questions to your father."`
	"CN-5758" `	"I really do not know. We checked everything before launch, everything, and yet during the jump the Moonfox's hyperdrive malfunctioned, knocking me out. When I woke up, I was in the wrong system and the Flivver was hurtling away from the star. Luckily, the engines hadn't been harmed too much, so I was able to turn around and thrust in the direction of <origin>, but then the batteries gave out and the generator stopped working. So I ended up stranded on a planet with no way of calling for help - the flares had triggered when I crashed, being unable to slow down without thrusters. Well, now you know. Is there anything else?"`
	"CN-5759" `	August asks, "Do you think someone could have sabotaged the hyperdrive? Any suspicious Syndicate employees hanging around? Any anything out of the ordinary?"`
	"CN-5760" `	"Not that I remember," replies Artemis. "This rarely happens in spaceship racing, but it's still happened. A one-in-a-million chance, perhaps. I wouldn't worry about it too much."`
	"CN-5761" `	"You have good taste, Captain. It's modified for racing: lighter hull plating, no weapon mounts, ample engines, of course. We've got a dozen for all the different races, but that one was a personal favorite."`
	"CN-5762" `	"Why did you crash?`
	"CN-5763" `	"I have no more questions."`
	"CN-5764" `	Artemis nods. "Well, could we head back to <planet> now? It'll be nice to get home after all this commotion and discomfort."`
	"CN-5765" `	Artemis and her father head off to their bunks, talking all the way. You chart a course for <destination>.`
	"CN-5766" `As the advanced medical facilities of <planet> rush up and past the ship, August comes to the bridge. "Truly, thank you, Captain, for sticking through this mess with me, and for continuing to search even when hope was gone.`
	"CN-5767" `	"I would like to reward you with a payment of <payment> for your services, and apologize for the inconvenience this might have caused you."`
	"CN-5768" `	Soon afterwards, the Renards head out of the <ship>. The moment they exit the hatch, a veritable army of attendants appears out of nowhere, ready to help them move the five feet to a Shuttle that has just landed on a pad next to you. August waves, and steps in.`
	"CN-5769" `While you are checking your incoming messages, you notice one from Artemis Renard, the crashed racing pilot who you rescued a couple months ago.`
	"CN-5770" `	"Captain <last>,`
	"CN-5771" `	"I'd like to thank you again for your timely rescue. Recovering from the ordeal has been a long process, of course, but a worthwhile one. As I've been working my way back into the various circuits, we've built up a surplus of increasingly outdated equipment. While we could, of course, simply have it scrapped locally, we were hoping that you might join us on <destination> to see if you can put it to better use."`
	"CN-5772" `		Sincerely,`
	"CN-5773" `			Artemis Renard`
	"CN-5774" `As Glory again rises to greet your ship, you receive a hail from a spacecraft that comes up alongside your ship. "Ho, Captain! Why don't you come to our estate, instead of the main landing port? It'll be easier." August Renard is leaning out the cockpit of a fancy Racing Flivver, looking much happier than when you first met him.`
	"CN-5775" `	You redirect your ship in the direction the Flivver is going, noticing that it has the same name as Artemis' ship which crashed on Sandswell.`
	"CN-5776" `	Soon, the dense main city of <planet> gives way to a perfectly-terraformed countryside with only one mar - a gigantic personal skyscraper that must be hundreds of meters high. A few landing pads are set in a neat array next to it, and the B-168 "Moonfox" lands on one of these, beckoning for you to land on another.`
	"CN-5777" `	(Land on one of the pads.)`
	"CN-5778" `	"What about my fleet?"`
	"CN-5779" `	"You have a mansion here!"`
	"CN-5780" `	"Later, later," Artemis shouts. "We'll talk in a place where we needn't yell."`
	"CN-5781" `	August calls, "You can let your fleet stay at the main spaceport; I'm afraid there's not room here."`
	"CN-5782" `	As you exit the <ship>, you notice that the Flivver has been painted in the same colors as your ship.`
	"CN-5783" `	August approaches. "Artemis wanted to give you something as a present for saving her life, and we were wondering if you would like to have this Flivver. We've managed to refurbish it enough that it should be perfectly functional, and if you want a fast ship there's nothing in the sky that can beat you."`
	"CN-5784" `	August leads you up the steps into the palatial mansion and into a large whitewashed room with a golden table. On the table lie keys for the starship Artemis used in her most recent race.`
	"CN-5785" `	"Well, I hope you like it." Artemis approaches. "It's been servicing me for quite a while, ever since I started racing. Unfortunately it's not fast enough anymore, even after the millions we spent on rebuilding it after the crash on Sandswell. Hopefully you'll be able to put it to better use." She smiles. "Of course, it would also be a good ship to sell, if you need the money."`
	"CN-5786" `	After spending another half an hour or so catching up, you say your goodbyes to the pair and head back to the main spaceport.`
	"CN-5787" `As you walk through the spaceport, you see someone ahead making very obvious disruptions in the flow of the crowd. They're going up to various people and talking to them, usually very briefly, before moving on to someone else. Before you know it, "someone else" is you.`
	"CN-5788" `	"You, you're a captain. Will you give me a ride? I need to get back to <stopovers>, pack up my things, and travel to <destination>." Their hair is slicked back to match their sharp suit.`
	"CN-5789" `	"Sure, as long as you can pay."`
	"CN-5790" `	"No, I've got better things to do."`
	"CN-5791" `	Just like with the others, as soon as you decline, they move on to someone else.`
	"CN-5792" `	They stop in surprise, then nod briefly. "I'll be at your ship within an hour."`
	"CN-5793" `	An hour later, you see them approach the <ship> carrying a small suitcase. They've exchanged their formal appearance for a button-down shirt and skirt with their hair loose, hanging down to their shoulders. They walk right up to you and stick out a hand. "Kris Brecht, they/them."`
	"CN-5794" `	(Shake their hand.)`
	"CN-5795" `	(Just stare.)`
	"CN-5796" `	You stare at Kris' unorthodox getup while they stand there with their hand out for a few beats. Then they sigh and take it back. "Will this be a problem?" They gesture to themselves.`
	"CN-5797" `	"No, I was just surprised."`
	"CN-5798" `	"I don't think I can carry someone like you."`
	"CN-5799" `	Their expression turns cold. "Right. I get it. Someone like me." They turn and stalk away.`
	"CN-5800" `	Their confident demeanor returns, and they nod. "I can have that effect on people. Glad to see you're not another of those stuck-up establishment types. Well, all the rest of my stuff is on <stopovers>, so we'd better get going!"`
	"CN-5801" `	You shake their hand. "<first> <last>. That's all you've got with you?"`
	"CN-5802" `	Kris nods. "All the rest of my stuff is on <stopovers>. I was just here for a meeting with some others who feel like I do about the establishment."`
	"CN-5803" `	"The... establishment?"`
	"CN-5804" `	(Just let it pass.)`
	"CN-5805" `	Kris nods again. "Yeah, y'know, The Man!`
	"CN-5806" `	"I don't support government or any of its tools, and I've heard that the South is more open to this kind of philosophy and lifestyle."`
	"CN-5807" `	Before you can say more, they walk past you onto the <ship>. "Which did you say my berth was again...?"`
	"CN-5808" `As you traveled to <planet stopovers>, you found yourself frequently listening to Kris' opinions on the subject of governments. While they had some very good points, other times they would spend hours ranting about things that seem completely impractical and without a solid foundation. If it weren't for the fact that they were unfailingly polite otherwise, and eager to help with chores around the ship, you would've declared the cockpit off-limits.`
	"CN-5809" `	Still, you are somewhat relieved that when you arrive, both of you are too out of breath from moving furniture to talk more.`
	"CN-5810" `	You soon have it loaded up, though, and start the trip south to <destination>.`
	"CN-5811" `At last, you reach <planet>, and Kris enthusiastically unloads their possessions into a waiting transport van. Before they disappear, they press a credit chip for <payment> into your hands and assure you that you are a valuable ally to the "anti-statist movement."`
	"CN-5812" `When you check your messages upon landing, you notice one from an unfamiliar source. At first, you think it's a scam, because it tries to redirect you through three different servers, but then you see it calls you "ally of the anti-statist movement."`
	"CN-5813" `	Sure enough, it's from Kris Brecht, the anarchist you transported to <planet>. "You have to come and get me. I can't stand living here any longer!" It includes directions to a home somewhere on <planet> where you last saw Kris, but nothing more.`
	"CN-5814" `You arrive on <planet>, rent a local transport, and make your way to the location specified. When you knock on the door, Kris bursts out almost instantly. This time, they've got on a ruffly skirt, a button-down shirt, and suspenders, and their hair is in a tight bun. "Finally!" they say. "Everything's packed already; we just need to load it in and get to the spaceport."`
	"CN-5815" `	It takes much less time to load everything this time than the last time you helped Kris move, and soon they hop in the driver's seat of the van, calling to you, "I'll meet you at the spaceport in an hour or two!"`
	"CN-5816" `Kris' possessions fit more easily into your hold this time - it seems like they really do have less than before. Once they're loaded in and Kris climbs aboard, they open their mouth to begin what is sure to be another of their interminable tirades on the power of the state.`
	"CN-5817" `	(Try to change the subject.)`
	"CN-5818" `	(Let them talk.)`
	"CN-5819" `	Surprisingly, Kris begins by talking about how uncomfortable the ever-damp weather on <origin> is, and how they'll be glad to be properly dry for the first time in weeks. This doesn't last, though, as soon talk of the planet brings up the other people there.`
	"CN-5820" `	You ask, "So, what is it about <origin> you can't stand? Is it the damp weather?"`
	"CN-5821" `	A fire kindles in Kris' eyes, and a righteous fury seems to possess them. "I thought when I came here that I'd be among like-minded souls. There's barely any government to speak of here! But then when the war started, they were aaaaall sooooo delighted with the so-called Free Worlds! 'Free!' They're just another state!"`
	"CN-5822" `	Kris continues in this vein as you complete your pre-flight checks. Fortunately, they do at least mention your destination is <destination> during their rant.`
	"CN-5823" `You arrive at Thule, and Kris once more eagerly unloads their belongings into a local transport. As with the previous journey, they were a strange combination of genuinely polite and helpful and deeply aggravating.`
	"CN-5824" `	Now, though, they stand on the tarmac and take in great lungfuls of air, proclaiming it "the air of true freedom." You're somewhat more skeptical of how the locals will treat them, being an outsider, but... well, maybe they'll actually get along.`
	"CN-5825" `	Kris skips back up the ramp to hand you a credit chip for <payment> before taking their transport and heading off to whatever is awaiting them out there on <planet>.`
	"CN-5826" `No sooner have you entered the spaceport than you are bowled over by a trio of adults, two women and a man, with a teenager trailing close behind them.`
	"CN-5827" `	"Oh - sorry!" the older of the two women exclaims. She puts out a hand to help you up, then gets a better look at you as you take it, stand, and dust yourself off. "Wait; are you a ship captain?" she says after a moment.`
	"CN-5828" `	"<first> <last>, captain of the <ship>," you reply. "Why?"`
	"CN-5829" `	"Oh! You may be the answer to our prayers, dearie!" She and the others have now gotten themselves a bit more organized, and you can tell that they must be a family. Confirming this, the woman says, "I'm Shirley Burnbeck, and this is my husband Darren. These are our children, Erin and Leigh." The other, younger woman, Erin, greets you with a smile, while the teen, Leigh, glances at you before turning their gaze towards the ground. "We were on vacation here on <origin> when news of the secession and those awful bombings came out. Well, I don't need to tell you, it's caused us some trouble! Or, well, maybe I do, because we're from <destination>, down in what they're now calling the Free Worlds!"`
	"CN-5830" `	Her husband cuts in, "Anyway, the short of it is that we really need to get home, and right now, none of the regular services are running from here to <planet> because of the likelihood of war. Could you possibly take the four of us back home? We... can't pay a lot, right now, but we can pay."`
	"CN-5831" `	"Of course. I wouldn't leave people stranded like this."`
	"CN-5832" `	"Sorry, I'm not headed that way. Best of luck."`
	"CN-5833" `	Four faces fall in front of you, and after a moment, they gather up their luggage again and start heading out the doors they crashed into you in. Shirley nods sadly as she goes, and says, "Well, I guess we understand. We'll find a way home somehow..."`
	"CN-5834" `	Four faces light up in front of you, and after a moment, they gather up their luggage again, and stand expectantly. "Well, where should we go?"`
	"CN-5835" `	You direct them to the berth where your ship is currently being refueled, and they all bustle off, seeming much more hopeful and relieved.`
	"CN-5836" `The trip south with the Burnbecks was mostly quite pleasant, but while they stop short of openly blaming them for the bombings on Geminus and Martini, they are very angry at the Free Worlds for seceding from the Republic. "We were perfectly happy belonging to the Republic," Darren said one evening in the mess. "I mean, seriously, did those people way down in, where is it, Zug? Bourne? Did they even think about the regular people and how this would affect them? Affect us?"`
	"CN-5837" `	While some of their complaints seem a bit selfish, it's hard to argue with the fact that this has disrupted a lot of lives. After touching down on <planet>, Darren, Leigh, and Erin joyfully run into the arms of their friends and family here. Shirley hangs back to hand you a credit chip for <payment> and thank you warmly (and at some length) for your help in getting home, before heading out to join her family in their reunion.`
	"CN-5838" `While walking through the spaceport, you are surprised to see Shirley and Darren Burnbeck, along with a young man, who you recognize as Leigh after a few seconds. They greet you warmly, reassure you that Erin is just off to university on Zug and so couldn't join them on this vacation, and invite you to have dinner with them at the spaceport cafe.`
	"CN-5839" `	You apologize, and they reassure you it's fine and thank you once again.`
	"CN-5840" `	You join them, and they listen raptly to your stories of participating in the Free Worlds' campaign to remain independent from the Republic. When you talk about transporting the Earth ambassadors to Bourne, Darren shakes his head in something like admiration.`
	"CN-5841" `	"You know," he says, "I was never quite sure that the Free Worlds hadn't really been behind those awful bombings, but now, it looks like I was wrong. In fact, I think I might have been wrong about a lot of things about the Free Worlds Council and Senate, back then. It's still true that they've upended our lives, but from what I've seen of their actions since, especially with the pirates, they really do seem to have the best interests of the people here in the South at heart."`
	"CN-5842" `	After a round of compliments and words of solidarity from the other members of the family, you finish up your dinners and bid them goodbye.`
	"CN-5843" `Walking through the spaceport, you see a man in a very neat suit standing by the side of the concourse holding a sign reading "Transport To <planet>" in beautiful lettering.`
	"CN-5844" `	(Walk towards him.)`
	"CN-5845" `	He turns a very professional smile on you and introduces himself. "My name is Tom Ardwright. My fiance is the Agriculture Minister on <destination>, down in the Free Worlds. We had planned to get married up here in a few months, but, well..." He gestures around at the general situation. "So I'm heading down to <planet> instead. Can you help?"`
	"CN-5846" `	"You're in luck; I'm the captain of the <ship>."`
	"CN-5847" `	"I can't help."`
	"CN-5848" `	Tom sighs and nods. "Thanks for hearing me out. Best of luck, wherever you end up."`
	"CN-5849" `	Tom's whole posture relaxes as his professional grin becomes a genuine smile. "Wow. This really means so much to me. You said it was the <ship>? I'll be on board in an hour."`
	"CN-5850" `During the trip to <destination>, you had several conversations with Tom on a wide range of topics, including his fiance, Carl, as well as his job as a marketer and designer for a division of Syndicated Systems - at least until he quit. "It'll be a shame to see my work for the Syndicate be replaced, but I don't regret leaving. Carl's got big plans in store for <planet>, now that we aren't stuck with the Republic's shoestring budget, and I wouldn't miss them for the galaxy."`
	"CN-5851" `	You stand at the foot of the ramp accepting Tom's fare of <payment> and bidding him farewell as Carl runs across the tarmac toward you. You step back as they practically leap into each other's arms, reuniting in spite of these tumultuous times.`
	"CN-5852" `After landing, you receive a message from Tom and Carl. Attached are photos of their wedding on Cornucopia, as well as a letter:`
	"CN-5853" `	We are delighted to announce that despite the many hardships around us in these times, the two of us were married three days ago at the Hart's Hill Vineyard on Cornucopia. This would not have been possible without you, and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Please enjoy these photos from the wedding.`
	"CN-5854" `				Tom & Carl Ardwright-Chamberlain`
	"CN-5855" `	You recognize Tom's style in the design of the photo set, which includes a photo of them on the tarmac at the Cornucopia spaceport where they were reunited after the uncertainty of the war parted them.`
	"CN-5856" `A young family of three is walking around the spaceport talking to merchant captains. From the looks of it, they're not having much luck.`
	"CN-5857" `	The parents introduce themselves as Penny Little and Rosa Perkins. Their young child is named Eduardo. Penny asks, "Any chance you're willing to take us and <tons> of our belongings to <destination>? We're concerned that the war between the Republic and the Free Worlds are going to get dangerous, so we want to raise Eduardo on a Quarg planet instead. We can pay <payment>."`
	"CN-5858" `	"Why were those other captains refusing to take you?"`
	"CN-5859" `	"What do you mean, 'Quarg planet'?"`
	"CN-5860" `	"The Quarg let humans live on one of their planets?"`
	"CN-5861" `	"Sure, I can take you."`
	"CN-5862" `	"Sorry, I'm not headed that way."`
	"CN-5863" `	"I think many of them are a bit distrustful of the Quarg. Plus, people are just generally more on edge these days with the tensions between the Free Worlds and the Republic, so they're less interested in flying somewhere unfamiliar. While I do understand those feelings, it seems to me that humans have done much worse to each other than the Quarg have ever done to us."`
	"CN-5864" `	She looks a bit surprised that you don't already know. "The Quarg are an advanced alien species that live in a corner of human space, near Tarazed. I honestly don't know that much else about them, but I've heard that they prefer to stay out of human matters. You could try talking to them if you want to know more.`
	"CN-5865" `	"There's a planet they control that has too much gravity for them, but is just right for humans, so they let humans settle there under their protection. Or at least that's what I've heard."`
	"CN-5866" `Upon landing on <origin> you take out the treasure map you recovered from the derelict ship. The map gives detailed instructions about where the treasure was buried on the sparsely populated world of <destination>. However, the map's creator claims to have obtained some kind of alien weapons that disrupts a ship's electrical systems. The outlandish claim seems to bring doubt to the validity of the map.`
	"CN-5867" `	(Follow the map.)`
	"CN-5868" `	(Throw the map away, it's probably fake.)`
	"CN-5869" `Flying low over <planet> you follow the instructions to an isolated valley where you promptly land and get to digging. After hours of shoveling the hard soil you're met with a thunk as you strike metal.`
	"CN-5870" `	Opening the cache reveals a large store of credits along with the alien weapons the map's owner wrote about. You marvel at their strange design and wonder at their power.`
	"CN-5871" `	(Loot the treasure.)`
	"CN-5872" `	Opening the cache reveals a large store of credits along with two Hai Ion Cannons. These must be the alien weapons the map's owner wrote about.`
	"CN-5873" `	You grab the <payment> credits, and with the assistance of some machinery you bring the weapons back to your ship.`
	"CN-5874" `Upon landing on <origin> you take out the text log you recovered alongside the case of <payment> from the derelict ship. The log reveals the credits were the result of a risky investment in an attempt to buy a better life for the captain of the ship, Colin Sawyer, and his family. You assume that the captain never made it home, and looking further into the personal log you find that the family used to reside on <destination>.`
	"CN-5875" `	Perhaps the family still lives there.`
	"CN-5876" `	(Attempt to return the credits.)`
	"CN-5877" `	(Keep the credits to myself.)`
	"CN-5878" `	You decide to keep the money. After all, it's not every day that you find a score worth <payment>.`
	"CN-5879" `Upon landing on <origin> you take a transport out to the small farm indicated in the log as the home of Captain Sawyer's family. After knocking on the door of the farmhouse a man opens the door and asks, "Can I help you?"`
	"CN-5880" `	"Do you know a Colin Sawyer?"`
	"CN-5881" `	"Do the Sawyers live here?"`
	"CN-5882" `	"Sawyer? Yeah, that's the family that sold me this here farm. If you're looking for them I believe they moved to a more populated planet, own some big corporation now." The man gives you the Sawyers' new place of residence on <destination> and bids you farewell.`
	"CN-5883" `It doesn't take long to find the Sawyers' home on <planet>. The building makes it clear that the family has done well for themselves. After a quick explanation to the desk clerk that you have something important to give, you take an elevator ride to the penthouse. You ring the buzzer and are greeted by a woman in her late fifties. "A delivery?" she asks.`
	"CN-5884" `	A scowl appears on her face as she spits out a response. "What do you know of my Da? That deadbeat left me and my family with next to nothing."`
	"CN-5885" `	"I don't know what happened to him personally, but I found this case of credits and a log explaining how he was trying to invest in a better life for his family."`
	"CN-5886" `	"I believe he died before he was able to bring back his business investment to your family. Here's his personal log, it explains everything."`
	"CN-5887" `	She takes the log from you and quickly scrolls through it, emotion washing over her features as she reads. Eventually she looks up, and with all the anger towards her father gone, she speaks. "Thank you for this. All these years I had believed he had just taken our money and run off. But knowing he had been trying to help is worth more than all the credits in the galaxy. Take them and then some as a reward for bringing me this last piece of him."`
	"CN-5888" `	You leave the building with a total of <payment> credits from both the case and Ms. Sawyer.`
	"CN-5889" `After looking around <origin>'s spaceport, you head back to your ship to find a middle-aged couple and two grade-school girls (probably their daughters, you reason) waiting for you at your landing pad. While the man tries to resolve an argument between the two girls, the lady notices you immediately and begins to approach you.`
	"CN-5890" `	"Thank goodness you're here," she says. "We've been going from ship to ship looking for transport back home to <destination>. This war has caught us right in the middle of our vacation and we can't risk being anywhere near here when the Navy attacks, especially with our little angels," she gestures toward her daughters, now in a full-blown fight.`
	"CN-5891" `	She looks back at you pleadingly. "If you can find the time to take us to <planet>, we will pay you very well."`
	"CN-5892" `	"Sure, I'll take you."`
	"CN-5893" `	"Okay, but that's pretty far. This better be worth it."`
	"CN-5894" `	"No, I don't think so. Sorry."`
	"CN-5895" `	"Then it's a deal," she says as she gives you a firm handshake. The whole family gets onto the <ship> without a word, leaving you to load their many bags and cases.`
	"CN-5896" `You're not sure if you've ever met a more pretentious and entitled family. The girls fought non-stop, and every family member complained constantly about the lack of luxury accommodations on your ship. Once you land on <planet>, the lady gives you <payment> and the family leaves without a word of thanks; they never even tell you their names. Considering what they put you through they should have paid you more, but nonetheless you're happy to be rid of them.`
	"CN-5897" `You're not sure if you've ever met a more pretentious and entitled family. The girls fought non-stop, but fortunately, the family was satisfied with the luxury accommodations on your ship. Once you land on <planet>, the lady gives you <payment> and the family leave without a word of thanks; they never even tell you their names. Nonetheless, you're happy to be rid of them.`
	"CN-5898" `While passing through the spaceport, you notice a few energetic pilots gathered around a computer terminal, invested in some sort of conversation. One of the pilots speaks louder than the rest, sometimes getting looks from others in the spaceport. "You've fooled me before, and I reckoned you were this time! And here I thought them dang things were old news!" The pilot lets out a hearty chuckle. "Even nowadays them Firkins are still getting names!" After another minute or two, the group walks away from the terminal and out of your sight.`
	"CN-5899" `	(Go see what this is about.)`
	"CN-5900" `	You walk up to the computer terminal, and on it is displayed a news article with a title that reads "Popular Votes For Ship Name Poll - Unexpected Results." The article is about a small transport company hearkening back to older times with a special transport voyage centered around a Hogshead space liner. You recall that, back in their day, Hogsheads were sort of a business fad because of endless discussion and nicknames based on the shape of their engine pods. Nowadays, the ship has all but lost the charm it once had, but it seems a good number of pilots are interested in this ordeal.`
	"CN-5901" `	For the event, the transport company decided to have a public poll to name the ship, and while initial suggestions were casual names such as "Stark Lady" or "Timelight", some of the most popular ones are actually a collection of joke names - ones you would imagine a toddler would have come up with. Apparently, the names have gotten enough attention and enjoyment out of pilots that the company decided to take the top five most popular results and hold a vote on them.`
	"CN-5902" `	Would you like to vote on the name as well?`
	"CN-5903" `	You navigate the article until you are directed to the poll itself, presenting you with the top five options.`
	"CN-5904" `	Star Empress`
	"CN-5905" `	Tycho's Legacy`
	"CN-5906" `	Shippy McShipface`
	"CN-5907" `	It's Dark Here`
	"CN-5908" `	What Asteroid`
	"CN-5909" `	After you make your selection, a "thank you" message appears, telling you that the result of the poll will be broadcast on the news once the voting period has finished. Afterwards, you go back about your business.`
	"CN-5910" `As you are walking around the spaceport, you see that more than a few pilots are watching the news on nearby displays. There are mixed emotions amongst the crowd - some pilots are having a good laugh while others seem disappointed or even confused. You aren't sure what this is about until, lo and behold, the result of that Hogshead naming poll from a while ago is clearly shown on a display - Shippy McShipface. You can't say it's all that much worse than some of the names you've heard pirates give their ships before, but it still seems silly that the transport company is actually going through with the name.`
	"CN-5911" `	All of the hyped discussions around Hogsheads in the past gave them a brief but strong popularity amongst transport organizations looking to grab the average passenger's attention. In the end, the company responsible for this naming poll got what they wanted, and a little bit of the Hogshead's spirit has been brought back, along with the interest of several pilots. Perhaps the name "Shippy McShipface" is fitting after all.`
	"CN-5912" `Your walk from the <ship> takes you out of <origin>'s bustling spaceport and into the overtly welcoming and carefully inoffensive streets of the spaceport town. Each path seems to be saturated with tourists and purpose-built to whisk travelers further away from their ships and deeper into the preternatural radiance of this Paradise World. The hand-crafted beauty is inescapable, a never-ending sequence of breathtaking views.`
	"CN-5913" `	As you walk, you eventually come across a perfectly manicured garden park named "Parc Manifold." You approach the gates to discover a ticket office, with signs advertising a free entry promotion this week only, crossing out the 3,400 credit regular admission fee.`
	"CN-5914" `	(Go to the park.)`
	"CN-5915" `	(Head back to my ship.)`
	"CN-5916" `	You have more important things to do than wander around an expensive terraformed garden.`
	"CN-5917" `	The park has been meticulously sculpted so that no matter where you stand, it appears as though you are in the center of a lush naturalist painting. Colorful, comforting flora bleed away from you at all angles, and adorable yet inaccessible fauna seem to hug the very periphery of your every step.`
	"CN-5918" `	The air is clear and crisp, and even the crunch of leaves and thud of the earth beneath your feet seems somehow delicious and satisfying. Finally, the sun begins to set and you remember from the signs that the park closes soon.`
	"CN-5919" `	As you approach the exit to the park a small dog pads over to you and looks at you with mournful eyes. It seems to be alone, with no owner anywhere in sight.`
	"CN-5920" `	(Call to the dog.)`
	"CN-5921" `	(Ignore the dog.)`
	"CN-5922" `	You ignore the dog and eventually it sulks away to interact with another patron of the park. As you return to your ship it begins to get dark, and you feel your day of quiet contemplation come to a close.`
	"CN-5923" `	"Come here," you call to the dog, which looks to be a poodle mix, and it obediently does as you command. You see that the dog is a male and check his collar:`
	"CN-5924" `	"Caesar Augustus - Property of the Mitchells"`
	"CN-5925" `	3 Mitchell Drive`
	"CN-5926" `	Palmyra City, Avalonia District,`
	"CN-5927" `	Glory, Wazn System`
	"CN-5928" `	"That's odd," you say to Caesar. "How did you get lost on the wrong planet, huh boy?"`
	"CN-5929" `	(Take Caesar to his owners on Glory.)`
	"CN-5930" `	(Leave Caesar here.)`
	"CN-5931" `	Perhaps his owners are on vacation and will be back looking for him any minute. Although it's getting dark and no one seems to be around, you decide the best course of action is to leave Caesar where you found him.`
	"CN-5932" `	As you turn away, Caesar begins to whine, but he soon quiets down when you don't come back to pick him up. Looking back, you notice him slinking off into the shadow of a perfectly manicured shrub.`
	"CN-5933" `	"Well, come on boy," you say. "Let's go."`
	"CN-5934" `	Caesar eagerly follows you back to your ship. He seems greatly relieved to be with you, and not left all alone at the park.`
	"CN-5935" `	Once back on your ship, you make sure he's fed, watered, and settled in for his interstellar journey.`
	"CN-5936" `Caesar has been very obedient the whole trip, much to your relief. He lies down by the airlock while your ship sets down in the local Palmyra spaceport, which is enclosed on all sides by a squalid urban landscape - the honeycombed homes of the humble help. You rent a vehicle and take yourself and Caesar beyond the blighted city and out into the pleasant, picture-perfect paradise of the affluent. One princely estate after another rolls past you as you drive deeper into the rural domains of the Republic's super-wealthy. Eventually, you come across a large metal gate that reads, "Mitchell Ranch."`
	"CN-5937" `Caesar has been very obedient the whole trip, unlike certain other dogs you've transported in the past. He lays down by the airlock while your ship sets down in the local Palmyra spaceport, which is enclosed on all sides by a squalid urban landscape - the honeycombed homes of the humble help. You rent a vehicle and take yourself and Caesar beyond the blighted city and out into the pleasant picture-perfect paradise of the affluent. One princely estate after another rolls past you as you drive deeper into the rural domains of the Republic's super-wealthy. Eventually, you come across a large metal gate that reads, "Mitchell Ranch."`
	"CN-5938" `	You spend another forty-five minutes of driving down long winding roads, past various outbuildings, lodges, retreats, guest houses, and hobby barns. At long last, you arrive at the massive central mansion. Waiting at the bottom of stone stairs is a footman who opens the door for you and summons the senior butler.`
	"CN-5939" `	The butler arrives and looks you over unhappily. "The lady of the manor is not expecting... guests. Perhaps, you've misread your appointment, or more likely, arrived at the wrong estate."`
	"CN-5940" `	(Show Caesar to the butler and ask to see his owner.)`
	"CN-5941" `	The butler's frown deepens as you show Caesar to him.`
	"CN-5942" `	He sighs and says, "Card, please." He holds out a silver tray and awaits your calling card.`
	"CN-5943" `	(Explain that I don't have a calling card.)`
	"CN-5944" `	(Place my card on the tray.)`
	"CN-5945" `	The butler's eyebrows rise in the slightest hint of surprise when you place your card on the tray. He promptly turns and disappears into the overlarge house. You, Caesar, and the footman all wait for half an hour before a woman arrives at the front entrance, wearing an exceedingly complicated gown.`
	"CN-5946" `	The butler smiles smugly. "How unfortunate. In that case, I have no choice but to bring you in through the servants' entrance. It's only proper."`
	"CN-5947" `	Instead of taking you up the wide stairs to the beautifully inscribed wooden doors, he ushers you around the side to a small plain door. You are left there with the footman to wait.`
	"CN-5948" `	Three quarters of an hour later, a woman wearing an exceedingly impractical dress arrives.`
	"CN-5949" `	"Mr. Boolinbrook says you've brought back my darling See-See?" She looks down her nose at you and waits for your response.`
	"CN-5950" `	"Your dog is safe and sound with me."`
	"CN-5951" `	"I found Caesar alone, out in a park on Calda."`
	"CN-5952" `	"Here he is. You're welcome."`
	"CN-5953" `	Before you can respond, Caesar starts yapping happily and runs up to the lady.`
	"CN-5954" `	She snatches up the dog and draws it to her bosom. "Oh my darling See-See! It has been most dreadful waiting for news of you!"`
	"CN-5955" `	After a moment she turns her attention back to you, looking slightly softer than before. "See-See tires of the parks here, and so every Tuesday I send him to Calda for a change of pace. It's good for his constitution, you know. Anyway, the horrid man who normally ferries our dogs on these little excursions had some sort of episode. A stroke, or a heart attack - you get the idea. He had an assistant return the dogs, but in the confusion, they forgot my little See-See. I was sure some gauche tourist would have snatched him up and eaten him by now."`
	"CN-5956" `	She turns her attention back to the dog and speaks to him in baby talk. "But, instead, this gallant captain saved you!"`
	"CN-5957" `	The lady snaps her fingers, and the butler is immediately at her side. "We must make this person whole. I can't be perceived as owing favors to vagabonds. Imagine the talk!"`
	"CN-5958" `	The butler quickly procures a credit chip and shows it to her, accepting a curt nod for approval. "I realize that this is probably a fortune to you," she says. "I recommend you find a financial advisor and invest it well."`
	"CN-5959" `	With that, she turns and leaves; the butler likewise disappears, and you're escorted by the footman back to your vehicle.`
	"CN-5960" `	You look down at the credit chip in your hand and read its value: <payment>.`
	"CN-5961" `As you're walking through the spaceport, your eye is drawn to a marginally familiar figure on a nearby newsfeed. Although you can't make out exactly what it is saying over the din, you are able to gather that Caesar, the little lost dog you ran into on Calda, has become something of a minor celebrity after it managed to get back home to Glory all by itself. The newsfeed scrolls down to show images of the dog skiing, sneaking onto transports, and riding automatic farming equipment.`
	"CN-5962" `Walking on the edges of <origin>'s spaceport district, you notice signage advertising an exhibition about the planet Hope and the disaster and evacuation that happened on it in 2994; you vaguely remember it as being a planet in a system southwest of New Boston. But what makes it stand out from the typical advertisements that you see on notice boards and interactive screens is some of its colorful language: "Considered Offensive by Paradisians," "Why We Can't Give Up Hope," and "Evicted by the Paradise Planets."`
	"CN-5963" `Walking on the edges of <origin>'s spaceport district, you notice signage advertising an exhibition about the planet Hope and the disaster and evacuation that happened on it in 2994; you remember having been there once before on an excursion. But what makes it stand out from the typical advertisements that you see on notice boards and interactive screens is some of its colorful language: "Considered Offensive by Paradisians," "Why We Can't Give Up Hope," and "Evicted by the Paradise Planets."`
	"CN-5964" `Walking on the edges of <origin>'s spaceport district, you notice signage advertising an exhibition about the planet Hope and the disaster and evacuation that happened on it in 2994; you remember talking about it with Katya and Ijs while you were investigating the source of the nuclear bombings. But what makes it stand out from the typical advertisements that you see on notice boards and interactive screens is some of its colorful language: "Considered Offensive by Paradisians," "Why We Can't Give Up Hope," and "Evicted by the Paradise Planets."`
	"CN-5965" `	At the bottom of each sign are the directions to get to the exhibition. It appears to be located in a warehouse yard nearby, where the spaceport district borders the city that surrounds it.`
	"CN-5966" `	(Not interested.)`
	"CN-5967" `	Following the signage, you notice a substantial group of people gathered in front of a large warehouse that stands out amongst the rest of the warehouses in the yard. As you wait in the queue, a young woman lines up behind you with a readily apparent exuberance and asks you, "Just out of curiosity, how much do you know about Hope and its history?"`
	"CN-5968" `	"Not much at all."`
	"CN-5969" `	"I come from the Dirt Belt, but I really don't know too much about what happened on Hope."`
	"CN-5970" `	"I've been there myself and know what happened, but other than that I don't know."`
	"CN-5971" `	"I've been there myself, actually, and met some people affected by it."`
	"CN-5972" `	"I haven't been there myself, but I know people who have been affected by it."`
	"CN-5973" `	"Well then it's a good thing you're seeing Adelita's exhibition on Hope. It's really moving. You'll learn a lot about the tragedy and what Parliament and the Paradise Worlds did to everybody who tried to help," she adds somewhat sullenly. "You know, this was their first work that really got them famous in the interplanetary scene, but they've been forced to close it, so today's their final day. I had to see it one more time before they went."`
	"CN-5974" `	"Oh, wow! It must have been a harrowing experience. Adelita does a powerful job of giving you the whole story, though, and I bet you'll still learn a lot. You might even feel as if you've been transported back there yourself," she says. "You know, this was their first work that really got them famous in the interplanetary scene, but they've been forced to close it and today's their final day. I had to see it one more time before they went."`
	"CN-5975" `	"Who's Adelita?"`
	"CN-5976" `	"Why did they have to close it?"`
	"CN-5977" `	"They're an independent journalistic collective all about the injustices of human civilization. No one knows who they really are, but Adelita's work is what inspired me to study journalism. Their use of mixed media, their eye for story telling... I just love it. I know you're going to love it too," she says.`
	"CN-5978" `	"Well, this exhibition used to be permanent, but the planetary government was pressured by the Paradise Planets to force Adelita to leave. What Parliament and the Paradise Planets did to the people of Hope was abhorrent. Now Adelita's bringing light to it, and they're being silenced. It's wrong."`
	"CN-5979" `	You reach the entrance to the exhibition soon enough. Inside is a large room filled with photos, videos, interviews, and other mixed media. They focus on three groups: the refugees of Hope, the Navy that saved them, and the Paradise Worlds that protested the evacuation. At one end of the warehouse, there is an installation with nearly a hundred original protest signs from rallies against the Dirt Belt and the Republic Navy; some of them are quite crude and tasteless. It's a strong rebuke to see those displayed here, so close to the Paradise Planets.`
	"CN-5980" `	There are many, many photos, but one in particular catches your eye. It's of a woman standing in line to board a ship, a baby held at her hip and a look of sadness and determination on her face. The mother and child's cheeks, rosy and chapped, stand out in contrast with the cold blues in the background.`
	"CN-5981" `	You head toward the exit, but as the automatic doors open, an arctic blast pummels into you from out of nowhere. Instead of <origin>'s spaceport, you find yourself in a life-sized 3D representation of the evacuation of Hope, complete with simulated climate effects and a projected horizon. There are huge Navy Cruisers and Auxiliaries in a snowy field near a small town gradually being covered by ash as hundreds of refugees slowly board. But what stands out most is the massive volcano erupting in the background.`
	"CN-5982" `	"It's more of a collage than an exact rendering," says the young woman you met in line, having followed you all this way. "They took 3D recordings from different moments and areas of Hope and edited them together in various loops. The volcano was actually on the other side of the planet, for example. The magic of editing. What do you think?"`
	"CN-5983" `	"Impressive."`
	"CN-5984" `	"It's alright."`
	"CN-5985" `	"Isn't that a bit deceptive?"`
	"CN-5986" `	"I've been here ten times and I always manage to be awestruck," the woman replies. "Enjoy the exhibition while you still can!" She heads for the exit.`
	"CN-5987" `	(Continue wandering around the exhibit.)`
	"CN-5988" `	(Go to the exit.)`
	"CN-5989" `	"Deceptive?! No," the woman responds in a ruffled manner. "If you call this deception you must have a distaste for the media," she chuckles. "This form of journalism is as authentic as journalism gets! Now, of course Adelita takes creative liberties, but it's all in the pursuit of education and justice.`
	"CN-5990" `	"Well, for what it's worth, I've been here ten times and I always manage to be awestruck," the woman says. "Enjoy the exhibition while you still can." She heads for the exit.`
	"CN-5991" `	Inside houses, you see families frantically gathering their belongings and running for the Navy ships. You walk down one of the lines of refugees, observing each person - their faces harried, frightened, resolute. From the corner of your eye, you notice that a Navy officer slips in the snow, and as you look around, a young man helps him up. Wandering around the exhibit gives you a sense of the desperation of the people as they evacuate, though it's a bit disconcerting when the occasional hologram walks through you.`
	"CN-5992" `	Inside houses, you see families frantically gathering their belongings and running for the Navy ships; it strikes you that somewhere here is a young Katya leaving her doomed home. You walk down one of the lines of refugees, observing each person - their faces harried, frightened, resolute. From the corner of your eye, you notice that a Navy officer slips in the snow, and as you look around, a young man helps him up. Wandering around the exhibit gives you a sense of the desperation of the people as they evacuate, though it's a bit disconcerting when the occasional hologram walks through you.`
	"CN-5993" `	As you move on, you're startled to find yourself face-to-face with the woman holding the baby, right where they were in the photo. She takes little steps toward the ship while bouncing the baby on her hip. A young woman with a camera and a respirator covering her face walks up to her, asks a question, and begins to take photos.`
	"CN-5994" `	Suddenly, the entire projection disappears in a disorienting flash, leaving you in a cordoned-off section of the warehouse. The exhibit is nearly empty as a woman walks up to you. "One of the authors loves that moment too. That's probably why she fought so hard to have that part left in." She mutters something about a "security risk" under her breath, and then turns her attention back to you.`
	"CN-5995" `	"Oh, how rude of me," she says, offering her hand. "My name is Mariel. I organize these exhibitions and act as a spokesperson for Adelita. And you are?"`
	"CN-5996" `	"I'm <first> <last>."`
	"CN-5997" `	"I'm Captain <last>."`
	"CN-5998" `	"Captain," she says, her eyes lighting up. "Well, as you may know, this is the last day of the exhibition. The captain I hired to transport everything back to <planet> is not only rude, but is now late. I would much rather have it in the hands of someone who appreciates the work. I was going to pay him 60,000 credits, but I'll pay you <payment> to take his contract instead given the short notice. What do you say?"`
	"CN-5999" `	"Right," she says. "Hey, would you happen to know any ships which can take on <tons> of this exhibition's equipment to <destination>? As you may know, this is the last day of the exhibition. The captain I hired to transport everything is not only rude, but is now late, and I need someone to take his contract on short notice."`
	"CN-6000" `	"Well, I'm the captain of the <ship>."`
	"CN-6001" `	"Sorry, I can't help you."`
	"CN-6002" `	Mariel's eyes light up. "Great! I was going to pay him 60,000 credits, but I'll pay you <payment> to take his contract instead. What do you say?"`
	"CN-6003" `	"I would love to."`
	"CN-6004" `	"I've got more pressing matters at hand."`
	"CN-6005" `	"Oh. I thought that would be a pretty good deal for you, especially given the chance to meet the artists. But it's your call."`
	"CN-6006" `	"I'm sorry, I can't take the job."`
	"CN-6007" `	"Great!" Mariel says. "I will have our crew get everything ready to load at your ship promptly."`
	"CN-6008" `	After a couple hours, the whole exhibition is packed up and ready for transport to <planet>.`
	"CN-6009" `	"That's unfortunate. I'll have to find someone else, then." Mariel glances at her watch. "Well, anyway, the exhibition has closed. I'm going to have to ask you to leave."`
	"CN-6010" `	Following her, you find the true exit of the warehouse and go back out onto the more familiar grounds of <origin>'s spaceport.`
	"CN-6011" `After navigating the thick fog of Moonshake's atmosphere, you find a motley crew waiting on your landing pad. After they're done taking Adelita's cargo away, one of the crew walks up to you and hands you a credit chip for <payment> and a note. It reads:`
	"CN-6012" `	Meet me at the Common Grounds Cafe in the spaceport if you're interested in assisting us with a new project. Make sure you're not followed.`
	"CN-6013" `		-Adelita Zero`
	"CN-6014" `It takes a while to navigate through the bustling spaceport and the almost viscous fog of <origin>. After finding an information screen, you're able to get to the Common Grounds Cafe, which has a funky vibe to it and is quite busy. Nobody seems to recognize you, so you take a seat at a booth and order something to eat.`
	"CN-6015" `	Before your meal arrives, however, a woman with dark hair, maybe in her late thirties, sits down across from you and hails the server. She cheerfully orders a smoothie with a long list of ingredients, many of which you have neither heard of nor can pronounce.`
	"CN-6016" `	"Sorry for the cloak and dagger bit," the woman says to you finally. "We have enemies in high places. So Captain <last>, what did you think of the exhibition?"`
	"CN-6017" `	"I found it quite moving."`
	"CN-6018" `	"It was okay."`
	"CN-6019" `	"It was too political for me."`
	"CN-6020" `	"I'm glad you liked it," she says, smiling.`
	"CN-6021" `	"Not exactly a rave review, but you're entitled to your opinion," she says, smiling.`
	"CN-6022" `	"Oh. Unfortunately for many, everything is political. It was political when the Paradise Worlds tried to block the evacuation. And it was political when the Navy did it anyway without the permission of Parliament. And the same goes for every single act of oppression and liberation since the dawn of humanity. Our oppressors are very political. Maybe you have the hope of being one someday: wealthy, authoritarian, exploitative. Or maybe you just don't care. Either way, you don't sound like a good fit for this project. But thanks for transporting the installations," she says with a smile. She gets her smoothie to-go and walks out.`
	"CN-6023" `	"I heard from Mariel that you saw me take the photos of the woman and her baby," she says. "I really liked that moment, but not many notice it." She takes a quick glance around before leaning in closer. "We need a captain to transport a team to one planet, quickly land on another, and then pick up the team and return here with everyone safe and sound. I can't tell you much more than that until you accept, but it's nothing too dicey. It's a dangerous universe, though, so who knows?" She looks at you expectantly.`
	"CN-6024" `	"Oh, and we have to leave today. It will pay, of course. <payment>. So, what do you say? Are you in or out?" When she finishes speaking, your order is served while she drinks her smoothie.`
	"CN-6025" `	"In."`
	"CN-6026" `	"Out."`
	"CN-6027" `	"Great. My name is Alejandra, but call me Ale. Here's the plan: you're going to drop me and a friend off at <planet>, where we'll film the conditions in a secret Syndicate sweatshop.`
	"CN-6028" `	"Thing is, these aren't just poorly paid factory workers. They're slaves. As you can imagine, we can't get in as regular workers, so with a bit of hacking, we got ourselves jobs on-site as private security. We know that one of the Syndicate's 'trusted contractors' is getting the slaves from the pirates on Covert, and we also know where they're doing the transaction.`
	"CN-6029" `	"So while we get the footage we need in the factories, you'll be going with my associate, Bunker, to spy on the Syndicate's rendezvous with the pirates on Hippocrates."`
	"CN-6030" `	"Hold on, pirates?"`
	"CN-6031" `	"Won't this get me in trouble with the Syndicate?"`
	"CN-6032" `	"Don't worry, Bunker is a pro, and we have an array of long-range stealth drones that do the spying. You won't be anywhere near them. You might encounter some lone pirates on the way though, so you'll need to be quick."`
	"CN-6033" `	"Well, I did say we had enemies in high places, didn't I? But don't worry. Bunker's a pro. We have an array of long-range stealth drones that do the spying. You won't be anywhere near them, though pirates do frequent the system, so you'll need to be quick."`
	"CN-6034" `	"Got it."`
	"CN-6035" `	"Sorry, I don't like the sound of this."`
	"CN-6036" `	She waves to the server for the bill as she finishes the last gulp of her smoothie. "Let's go. Everyone will be meeting at the landing pad shortly."`
	"CN-6037" `	You go back to the <ship>'s landing pad, and sure enough, there are two people with backpacks and a few cases waiting for you. They introduce themselves as River and Bunker, and they enthusiastically stow their equipment away without a hitch.`
	"CN-6038" `	"Good. Now that that's done with, let's load up," says Bunker, before letting out a holler. "Taking down the Man. I love it!"`
	"CN-6039" `	"I'm sorry to hear that... I suppose it just wasn't meant to be." She gulps down her smoothie at lightning speed before leaving just as quickly.`
	"CN-6040" `You drop off Ale and River at the spaceport, watching as they try to seem neither visibly embarrassed to be in their security uniforms nor uncomfortable with their disguises, even though they're now virtually indistinguishable from other Syndicate personnel. Bunker can't stop laughing at them. Everyone wishes each other luck as the two walk off, and you and Bunker go back to the <ship> and prepare for the journey to <planet>.`
	"CN-6041" `As you enter <origin>'s atmosphere Bunker explains that you need to find a place to land in order for him to be able to release the drones. Luckily on this part of <origin>, it's not hard to find a remote canyon within range of the target area.`
	"CN-6042" `	Bunker locates a sheltered outcrop near the <ship> and releases the drones from a briefcase he took with him; the drones are so small you can't make them out. He then unpacks the drones' controller and display feed and sets it up on a flat boulder, using a smaller rock as a stool to sit on while he prepares the drones. "Okay, they're on autopilot to the rendezvous site."`
	"CN-6043" `	As you watch the display, the drones arrive on site, and you can see a lone Syndicate-built freighter with a security detail posted in front of the loading ramp. "The pirates must be late," says Bunker, smirking. "Typical. I'm going to scatter the drones and set a proximity alert."`
	"CN-6044" `	He hums to himself for a while before he turns to you and starts talking again. "You know, there's a part of me that would much rather be liberating slaves instead of filming them, but for now it seems like this is the best way for me to help. Say we did liberate them right now; there's just going to be another slave ship tomorrow. But if we create political and social pressure, that could stop the slave ships forever."`
	"CN-6045" `	"I think you're right."`
	"CN-6046" `	"What about doing both?"`
	"CN-6047" `	"Are you sure it's that simple?"`
	"CN-6048" `	"Thank you! It's good to hear someone who's optimistic about this. Way too many people are unconscious about slavery in our civilization, or they believe there's nothing anybody can do about it. If we can-" A chirp from the proximity alert cuts him off.`
	"CN-6049" `	"Of course not. And that's why I'm working here instead, to make sure there'll be a time and place in the future where we can finally declare the galaxy free of slavery. What if-" A chirp from the proximity alert cuts him off.`
	"CN-6050" `	"Now you're talking! But it would take a lot of planning to do it without killing the people we're trying to liberate. You know they'll use those poor people as human shields. Say we-" A chirp from the proximity alert cuts him off.`
	"CN-6051" `	"Showtime!" he exclaims, rubbing his hands together. Both of you watch as a Vanguard flying pirate colors, accompanied by a small flotilla of Quicksilver escorts, lands near the security detail, probably deafening them with the sound of their repulsors. As soon as the loading ramp is down, the security detail gets to work herding the slaves from one ship to another - hitting, shoving, and shouting at anyone that moves too slowly for their liking.`
	"CN-6052" `	"Pigs," blurts out Bunker. He zooms in on two men talking a few meters away from everyone else. One is in a suit, the other a black hooded robe. "Must be the leaders," he whispers as if they can hear him. Just then, the hooded man looks up to the sky as if he sees something. He motions, and the Quicksilvers fire up their engines.`
	"CN-6053" `	"Oh, I don't like the look of this," says Bunker.`
	"CN-6054" `	"Did he see us?"`
	"CN-6055" `	"Call back the drones now."`
	"CN-6056" `	"I think we'll have to leave the drones behind."`
	"CN-6057" `	"Keep filming."`
	"CN-6058" `	"I don't know. I think we oughta get going," says Bunker, grimacing.`
	"CN-6059" `	"Okay. Call the drones back."`
	"CN-6060" `	"That's an order!"`
	"CN-6061" `	"You're the captain, you decide whether we go or not," Bunker responds in a sore tone. Meanwhile, you continue to watch the display. It takes a couple minutes before the last of the slaves are loaded, followed by the security team. The two men in the suit and hood are the last to board their ships.`
	"CN-6062" `	You hear the sudden hum of repulsors overhead, replaced simultaneously by the reports of particle cannons from the Quicksilvers! You think you hear Bunker swear as he leaps off his seat, the both of you running towards the <ship>, dirt and rock kicking up around you from strafing particle fire- until you're engulfed by a searing yellow beam that splits your body apart as a Quicksilver finally finds its mark.`
	"CN-6063" `	"I have no idea," says Bunker. "But it's probably time to go."`
	"CN-6064" `	"I think we have to leave the drones behind."`
	"CN-6065" `	Bunker hits the recall button for the drones anyway. "This display is a low resolution proxy," explains Bunker. "If we leave the drones, we'll lose all the footage we need. It looks like the Quicksilvers aren't coming straight for us. We have time. The drones are less than two minutes out."`
	"CN-6066" `	"We're leaving. Now!"`
	"CN-6067" `	"Fine. Get to the <ship> and lock down the drones as soon as they land. We take off on your mark."`
	"CN-6068" `	"I can't let you do that, <first>," says Bunker, standing between you and the controls. "The drones are almost here. It'll take me no time to lock them down once we're on the <ship>, then we're out of here.`
	"CN-6069" `	(Force him to stand down.)`
	"CN-6070" `	(Get back to the <ship> and let Bunker lock down the drones.)`
	"CN-6071" `	You nod, and Bunker immediately packs up the entire controller and display set, packing it away in his briefcase in seconds.`
	"CN-6072" `	"Aye aye, Captain," he says as he hits a button. "Drone ETA: two minutes, fifteen seconds." He packs up the entire controller and display set and has it packed away in his briefcase in seconds.`
	"CN-6073" `	The both of you race onboard the <ship> and you prepare it for take off while Bunker heads to the cargo bay to receive the drones. "Lock down the drones as soon as they arrive and get belted in," you say over the comms to Bunker. "We'll take off on your mark."`
	"CN-6074" `	Less than a minute later, you hear Bunker's reply. "Drones are locked down and ready to go."`
	"CN-6075" `	You immediately raise the shields and take off. The moment you pull out of the canyon, pirate Quicksilvers appear from every direction; not far behind them, the Vanguard you saw earlier. You shunt the <ship>'s repulsors into full blast and accelerate into space with the pirates in hot pursuit.`
	"CN-6076" `	You get up and point your pistol at Bunker while ordering him to stand down. "Don't do this," he says, shrinking from you as he puts his hands up. As you are restraining him you hear the sudden hum of repulsors overhead, replaced simultaneously by the reports of particle cannons from the Quicksilvers! You find yourself letting go of Bunker, the both of you running towards the <ship>, dirt and rock kicking up around you from strafing particle fire- until you're engulfed by a searing yellow beam that splits your body apart as a Quicksilver finally finds its mark.`
	"CN-6077" `You managed to deal with the Quicksilvers and arrive on <origin> alive. As soon as you land, Ale and River rush on board, obviously relieved to be out of their disguises, and they spend a lot of time talking with Bunker about his part of the mission. Although exhausted, all of them are eager to get back and process what they filmed - both emotionally and literally.`
	"CN-6078" `	"That was horrible, but we got it done," Ale mumbles. "Can we leave now?"`
	"CN-6079" `Ale, River, and Bunker look glad to be back on <planet>. "Being there in person was bad enough," Ale grumbles as she looks through a stack of folders on her datapad. "Now we have to watch it over and over again to edit it into something presentable."`
	"CN-6080" `	As they are leaving, Ale hands you a stack of credit chips totaling <payment>. "There's a bonus in there for you. We really couldn't have done it without you," she tells you with a bittersweet smile. "Of course, you'll be one of the first to know when it's done."`
	"CN-6081" `	She starts off to join River and Bunker out in the spaceport before turning around one last time in the doorway. "We might be in need of you for some future projects too, Captain <last>. But goodbye for now. Stay safe on the star lanes!"`
	"CN-6082" `As you are walking through the spaceport, you are startled by a sudden loud beeping from a nearby computer terminal. The computer is unattended and the screen is blinking on and off.`
	"CN-6083" `	When you approach, you are greeted by plain text on the terminal's screen:`
	"CN-6084" `		"SOS: Megaparsec employee kidnapped by pirates, can't respond. <waypoints> standard coordinates: RAD AU 30.12 LAT 0.2 LON 303.9. Life in danger, need urgent rescue. Cannot otherwise communicate, all signals monitored. Please help!"`
	"CN-6085" `	You note that the message appears to be coming from an emergency transmitter commonly found on many small shuttles and escape pods. There is no shortage of pirates in <waypoints>, which is only a system away from Megaparsec's headquarters on <planet>. Presumably, you'll be expected to head there after rescuing the Megaparsec employee.`
	"CN-6086" `	(Head to <waypoints>.)`
	"CN-6087" `When you enter <waypoints>, your sensors detect a pirate Vanguard and a derelict Emergency Shuttle aimlessly drifting near the coordinates in the original message. Almost immediately, you receive a message from the pirate ship.`
	"CN-6088" `	"You were unwise to get involved in our business. Hand over that pompous salesman Howard, and I'll let you live."`
	"CN-6089" `	"Uhhh... hand over who?"`
	"CN-6090" `	"I don't negotiate with pirates!"`
	"CN-6091" `	"You can take him, but I don't know where he is."`
	"CN-6092" `	"Bah, you spineless buffoon! Your lies won't save you or that useless salesman. I'll find him in your ship's wreckage!"`
	"CN-6093" `	"Aye, then I won't negotiate with you! Prepare to meet your end!"`
	"CN-6094" `	The Vanguard's engines roar to life and you see a baker's half-dozen guns take aim at your ship, ready to fire.`
	"CN-6095" `You board the Emergency Shuttle to see its desperate and nearly incoherent occupant. "Oh thank the stars, thank you! Captain, you've got to save me - please! I'm Howard. I promise you a reward if you can fix up this tin can so I can get to my office on <planet>! I'm with Megaparsec, I can make it worth your while!"`
	"CN-6096" `	"What's the deal with you and that pirate?"`
	"CN-6097" `	Howard takes a breath and seems to calm himself. "That pirate was a potential investor in the firm I work for. We had a disagreement over the terms and it obviously got quite out of hand. I'll need to find a new business partner now..." He trails off. Time to get Howard back to <planet>.`
	"CN-6098" `When you land on <planet>, Howard is waiting for you at the spaceport, looking much more collected than he was on the Emergency Shuttle. "Thank you, truly. I'm Howard Vendeur, Investor Relations Associate with Megaparsec Incorporated. Anyway, I've managed to scrounge up my savings. It's not much to someone like you, I'm afraid. Just over ninety thousand credits.`
	"CN-6099" `	"However, I see you're clearly a captain of means. I'd have to pull a few strings, but I could get you into a private placement of a Megaparsec Inc. perpetual bond. To purchase a perpetual bond of Megaparsec Inc. I will need one million credits and for you to sign a few documents. This round is quite generous, with promised returns of over 35% per annum, to continue, of course, into perpetuity, paid out to you as a daily dividend of 1,000 credits."`
	"CN-6100" `	"Sure, I'll invest. What do I need to do?"`
	"CN-6101" `	"Megaparsec? I thought that was part of the Syndicate."`
	"CN-6102" `	"Private placement? Does that mean I own part of the Syndicate?"`
	"CN-6103" `	"No thanks. I'll take the money, please."`
	"CN-6104" `	"Megaparsec Incorporated is a proud affiliate of Syndicated Systems that accepts some private outside investment. We specialize in the design and manufacture of innovative, fast, and lightweight high-performance commercial and military space vehicles. Though a relatively young shipyard, our ships can still outmaneuver and outgun almost anything their size. Would you like to invest?"`
	"CN-6105" `	"Nope, I'll stick with the 90k."`
	"CN-6106" `	"Not quite. You will be a lender to an affiliate of Syndicated Systems - Megaparsec Incorporated. As a privately held business, there are few opportunities to invest, and even fewer people who are permitted to. It's quite an exclusive investment, with high returns, I might add. Would you like to invest with us?"`
	"CN-6107" `	"Excellent. I'll need to get approval for the bond sale and set up the paperwork. Feel free to come by my kiosk in the spaceport here later today if you're ready to invest, or another time if you need longer. Remember, you'll need to have at least one million credits for the bond purchase, and I'll need you to transport me to Hephaestus to take care of a few other administrative tasks."`
	"CN-6108" `	"Erhm, yes, of course. Here you are, my savings of ninety-one thousand, nine hundred and fifty one credits. I remain in your debt, and if you still want to invest in us, I will be here."`
	"CN-6109" `You visit the kiosk location Howard gave you at the spaceport, where he immediately spots you and approaches. When he arrives, he thanks you profusely and excitedly tells you what an exclusive offer you've received to be able to purchase a Megaparsec bond.`
	"CN-6110" `	"To reiterate, in order to purchase a perpetual Megaparsec Incorporated bond you will need to provide us with an up-front payment of one million credits, and sign some legal documents. Our promised returns are over 35% per annum, which we expect to continue into perpetuity, paid out to you as a daily dividend of 1,000 credits. Do you accept these terms?"`
	"CN-6111" `	"Sure, here's the one million credits."`
	"CN-6112" `	"I want to look through these documents before signing."`
	"CN-6113" `	"Can I get a lawyer to review this?"`
	"CN-6114" `	"I need more time to think about this."`
	"CN-6115" `	"No, I'd prefer not to become an investor."`
	"CN-6116" `	Howard chuckles as if your request were absurd.`
	"CN-6117" `	"Sure, sure, feel free to peruse the first page. But, uh, let me remind you -- this credit agreement is 101 pages long, over 87,000 words. Unless you've got degrees in Syndicate & Megaparsec regulatory investment law and all day to read, I suggest you focus on the highlighted parts. Time is money, my friend, and this deal won't wait forever!"`
	"CN-6118" `	Howard slides the cover and first page toward you and taps it impatiently with his pen.`
	"CN-6119" `	(Take a look at what Howard slid over.)`
	"CN-6120" `	"Alright, I'll sign."`
	"CN-6121" `	"If I can't read the whole thing, I won't sign it. I refuse to become an investor."`
	"CN-6122" `	You look down at the cover page of the private bond credit agreement:`
	"CN-6123" `	1,000,000 Credits`
	"CN-6124" `	PERPETUAL BOND CREDIT AGREEMENT`
	"CN-6125" `		among`
	"CN-6126" `	MEGAPARSEC INDUSTRIAL & SYSTEMS EXTERNAL REFUELING COMPANY LIMITED,`
	"CN-6127" `		as the Issuer,`
	"CN-6128" `	The Several Investors`
	"CN-6129" `	from Time to Time Parties Hereto,`
	"CN-6130" `	SYNDICATED SYSTEMS ADMIN & COLLATERAL LLC.,`
	"CN-6131" `		as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent,`
	"CN-6132" `	MEGAPARSEC FINANCE SECURITIES LLC.,`
	"CN-6133" `		as the Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner`
	"CN-6134" `	(Flip to the first page.)`
	"CN-6135" `	PREAMBLE: This Perpetual Bond Credit Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into as of the Effective Date by and between Megaparsec Industrial & Systems External Refueling Company Limited, a duly organized entity under the laws of interstellar commerce within Republic and Syndicate space ("Issuer") and the undersigned individual or entity ("Investor"). This Agreement is made in recognition of the Investor's intent to participate in the perpetual bond offering described herein, subject to all applicable terms, conditions, regulations, obligations, and supplementary materials explicitly or implicitly referenced throughout this document. By signing below, the Investor acknowledges receipt of this Agreement and agrees to the terms and conditions set forth herein.`
	"CN-6136" `	ARTICLE I - SUMMARY OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF INVESTMENT: The Investor, by executing this Agreement, irrevocably agrees to remit an upfront and final payment of One Million (1,000,000) Credits to the Issuer as consideration for the bond offering of Three Hundred Sixty-Five Thousand (365,000) Credits per annum into perpetuity, payable daily to the Investor. The payment from the Investor to the Issuer shall be deemed fully earned and non-refundable by the Issuer, irrespective of any subsequent event, transaction failure, action, or inaction on the part of either Party. The Issuer, upon receipt of the aforementioned payment, will extend to the Investor the rights and benefits outlined in this Agreement, provided that the Investor complies with all current and future legal, regulatory, and administrative requirements imposed by the Issuer or relevant Republic, Syndicate, or Megaparsec bodies -- including, without limitation, the execution of ancillary documents, disclosures, or agreements not enumerated herein. Refusal to execute any such future instrument may result in the immediate forfeiture of the One Million (1,000,000) Credits, with no further payments required by the Investor beyond the initial investment.`
	"CN-6137" `	The Investor acknowledges that they have been provided opportunity to review this Agreement in part or in full and may request a referral to legal counsel certified in Syndicate and Megaparsec regulatory investment law if desired at a standard rate. The Investor's signature below confirms their full and unconditional acceptance of this Agreement, including all foregoing terms and conditions, supplementary materials incorporated herein, and any future amendments or expansions thereto, which shall become immediately binding upon issuance by the Issuer.`
	"CN-6138" `	"I'm ready to sign!"`
	"CN-6139" `	"I think I need a lawyer."`
	"CN-6140" `	"But I don't have a 'complete understanding and acceptance of the foregoing terms and conditions,' so I'm backing out."`
	"CN-6141" `	Howard lets out a laugh, the sound a bit forced, his grin unwavering as a bead of sweat appears on his face. "Ah, I see, you're one of those detail-oriented types. Look, I appreciate thoroughness as much as the next businessperson, but let's be real here -- these documents are standard boilerplate. You don't need a complete understanding of every last word to recognize a golden opportunity when it's staring you in the face."`
	"CN-6142" `	He gestures back to the stack of papers with a casual wave of his hand. "But if you insist on taking more time to think or read through it all, let me remind you -- this offer isn't going to wait forever. Opportunities like this are rare, and hesitation could mean missing out entirely. So, what's it going to be? Are you ready to grasp the deal of a lifetime, or are you going to let this one slip through your fingers?"`
	"CN-6143" `	Howard taps his pen on the stack of documents, clearly impatient but maintaining a polished demeanor.`
	"CN-6144" `	"Okay, okay, I'll sign."`
	"CN-6145" `	"I want a lawyer."`
	"CN-6146" `	"Actually, let me take a look at the contract."`
	"CN-6147" `	Howard's smile tightens, his tone staying polite but firm. "Of course, you're entitled to seek legal counsel. However, both Syndicate and Megaparsec regulations require that any lawyer must be certified in both Syndicate and Megaparsec regulatory investment law, and pay the customary fees and dues. The required rate for such expertise is 795 credits per page reviewed, plus a base legal fee of 20,000 credits for document analysis. For this agreement, 101 pages, that comes out to 100,295 credits. A small price for peace of mind, wouldn't you say?"`
	"CN-6148" `	Howard leans forward, lowering his voice slightly. "If you'd like, I can even recommend someone -- reliable, efficient. What do you say?"`
	"CN-6149" `	"I'll just sign the investment."`
	"CN-6150" `	"Thanks, I'd appreciate a recommendation."`
	"CN-6151" `	"No thanks, I'll find someone on my own."`
	"CN-6152" `	Howard nods with a polished smile, already pulling a sleek datapad from behind the kiosk. With a few swift taps, he hands it to you, the screen lighting up with a carefully curated list of lawyers certified in both Syndicate and Megaparsec regulatory investment law.`
	"CN-6153" `	"As it happens, I've taken the liberty of compiling a list for your convenience. These are the best in the business -- every single one fully certified and capable of handling a document of this caliber. Naturally, I'd recommend the first name on the list," he says, tapping the top entry, which is highlighted in green.`
	"CN-6154" `	You glance down at the datapad. Each lawyer's availability is color-coded: green for immediate availability, yellow for waitlists stretching a few days, orange for weeks, and red for those not currently accepting new clients. The first lawyer, Howard's recommendation, is the only one highlighted in green.`
	"CN-6155" `	"Efficient, thorough, and well-versed in Megaparsec investment structures," Howard continues, his tone smooth. "And, of course, ready to assist immediately. They can review the documents for you today for the modest sum of 100,295 credits. If peace of mind is what you're after, this is your best option. Alternatively, you can always trust in the integrity of this opportunity and move forward now. The choice is yours."`
	"CN-6156" `	"I guess I'll go with the only available lawyer."`
	"CN-6157" `	"I'm backing out and not becoming an investor."`
	"CN-6158" `	You select the green-highlighted lawyer on the datapad. Immediately, a floating head materializes on the screen, a sharp-looking individual with neatly combed hair and a cool, measured gaze. Their eyes dart side to side as they rapidly scan the document.`
	"CN-6159" `	"Thank you for choosing my services," they say crisply. "This will just take a few minutes. Please hold."`
	"CN-6160" `	They reappear a few moments later with a professional yet reassuring expression. "Thank you for waiting. I've reviewed the document, and here are the key points.`
	"CN-6161" `	"First, the one million credits you're paying is completely non-refundable upon signing, even if the transaction falls through for any reason. Second, you may be required to sign additional documents or disclosures in the future. Refusing to do so could void the transaction and forfeit your one million credits. No further payments will be required beyond your initial investment. Lastly, standard boilerplate allows the agreement terms to be updated without notice for routine adjustments -- complying with new laws or a bond transfer. At worst, you might be asked to sign an additional disclosure at some point, but nothing that materially impacts your rights or obligations."`
	"CN-6162" `	The lawyer's eyes meet yours through the screen. "It's thorough but not unusual. Happy to have been of service." The lawyer's floating head blinks off the datapad.`
	"CN-6163" `	Howard, who has been waiting patiently, leans forward with his ever-polished smile. "Glad to see you got that legal review. Always a wise step for an investment of this magnitude," he says in a smooth and encouraging tone. He gestures to the stack of documents on the desk. "So, now that everything's in order, are you ready to sign and secure your investment?"`
	"CN-6164" `	"Yes, I'm ready to sign."`
	"CN-6165" `	"No, I don't want to invest in anything, I'm done."`
	"CN-6166" `	After you've signed numerous dotted lines, Howard says, "Alright, we have your payment and preliminary signatures. This particular investment is administered by Syndicated Systems as outlined in the agreement, so we'll need to submit this first set of paperwork to their office and then go to <destination> to sign the final documents and conduct a biometric scan at our secure facility. I'll go with you to help finalize the paperwork. Once that is complete, you should immediately start receiving dividend payments."`
	"CN-6167" `You land on <destination> and follow Howard's instructions to the biometric scan center. You hand in the first set of paperwork you filled out, and after scanning your fingerprint, retinas, and getting a blood sample, Howard comes over and says, "Excellent, only one last set of paperwork left to sign." He places one more set of documents on the table and taps the stack of papers.`
	"CN-6168" `	"New regulations dictate that we inform you that the proceeds of this bond may be used in high risk activities such as strip mining, clearing endangered habitats, or doing business on worlds with alleged human rights violations. All boilerplate language, of course, but you have to disclose every possibility these days." He shrugs.`
	"CN-6169" `	He then taps the documents again and says, "This is your final decision and the last set of paperwork. I would also like to disclose that your initial deposit covering the full one million credits is non-refundable. So, as a last formality, would you like to invest in the full investment suite?"`
	"CN-6170" `	"I'm backing out. I can't ethically invest in this."`
	"CN-6171" `	Howard nods. "I get it, ethics are important and I respect your decision. Unfortunately, the initial deposit is non-refundable, nothing I can do there. Best of luck finding another investment that suits you."`
	"CN-6172" `	"Excellent. As a bond owner of Megaparsec Incorporated, you will now receive a daily dividend. I have some work to attend to with our major shareholders, but it was a pleasure doing business with you, Captain."`
	"CN-6173" `After an uneventful trip to the spaceport you return to the <ship> and see a message from Howard, the Megaparsec salesman who sold you a one million credit bond. The message says:`
	"CN-6174" `	"<first> <last>! My bank contact tells me you've been doing quite well for yourself, and I've come across an even bigger investment opportunity than last time! Meet me at my new office on <planet> (note the address, I've moved up since my promotion). Looking forward to chatting with you!"`
	"CN-6175" `	"<first> <last>, my bank contact has informed me that you've achieved modest success. Meanwhile, I've come across an investment opportunity that far surpasses our previous venture. Meet me at my new office on <planet> (note the address, I've moved up since my promotion). I expect our meeting to be prompt and efficient."`
	"CN-6176" `		Howard Vendeur`
	"CN-6177" `		Investor Relations Manager, Megaparsec Incorporated`
	"CN-6178" `	(Message him back that I'm on the way.)`
	"CN-6179" `	(Send a message congratulating him on the promotion.)`
	"CN-6180" `	(Ignore and delete the message.)`
	"CN-6181" `	You immediately receive an automated response:`
	"CN-6182" `	"Dear Valued Contact,`
	"CN-6183" `	Thank you for reaching out. I am currently out of the office and will respond to your message as soon as possible.`
	"CN-6184" `	For urgent matters, please contact our support team."`
	"CN-6185" `You land the <ship> on <planet> and make your way to Howard's office at the Megaparsec Incorporated satellite office, which is close to the galactic headquarters of Syndicated Systems.`
	"CN-6186" `	You find yourself waiting in a sleek, sterile lobby, with the hum of distant machinery filling the air. The walls are lined with glossy advertisements for the various fast and lightweight ships, aircraft, and hovercraft that Megaparsec is known for, while a polite receptionist assures you that Howard will be with you "shortly," though you suspect that could mean anything from just a few minutes to many hours.`
	"CN-6187" `	(Stand and wait in the lobby.)`
	"CN-6188" `	(Take a seat in the lobby.)`
	"CN-6189" `	Much to your surprise, the wait is brief. Within minutes, Howard emerges with a warm smile, extending a hand as he welcomes you into his office, clearly eager to discuss the next big deal.`
	"CN-6190" `	Hours crawl by as the polished receptionist offers increasingly strained reassurances. Finally, Howard arrives, barely masking his annoyance, and motions for you to follow with a curt nod, clearly viewing you with disdain.`
	"CN-6191" `	The inside of Howard's office is modest yet stylish, with a sleek table, a few ergonomic chairs, and a large screen cycling through market trends. The minimalist decor is designed to impress anybody who comes in, but it's clear that this is more for show than substance.`
	"CN-6192" `	Howard gestures for you to take a seat as he settles behind his desk. His demeanor shifts slightly, and he leans forward, lowering his voice as if sharing a secret.`
	"CN-6193" `	"You know I've called you here for an incredible investment opportunity," Howard begins. "But before we get into that, I need a small favor. It's nothing too complicated, but there are too many prying eyes here. I'm wrapping up some meetings, but meet me at the spaceport later. I'll fly in my Shuttle as you escort me to Sunracer. I have a few work calls to take on the way, but I'll explain everything once we get there."`
	"CN-6194" `	"Sure thing, I'll see you later."`
	"CN-6195" `	"You have two offices?"`
	"CN-6196" `	"I don't care about prying eyes! What do you want and what do I get?"`
	"CN-6197" `	Howard raises an eyebrow and then waves you off with a chuckle. "All in good time, my friend," he says, leaning back. "It's nothing you can't handle. I'll fill you in once we're safely on Sunracer, and let's just say it'll be worth your while."`
	"CN-6198" `	Howard leans back with a knowing smile. "Well, 'office' is a bit generous for this place," he admits, gesturing around the room. "This is more of a glorified conference room that I can reserve for investor meetings here on Hephaestus. My real office is back on Sunracer, where the serious deals happen. You'll see what I mean when we get there."`
	"CN-6199" `	"Can't wait."`
	"CN-6200" `	"Is that a glorified conference room too?"`
	"CN-6201" `	Howard's smile falters slightly. He forces a light chuckle, though the tension is noticeable. "Well, if I'm being honest, the Sunracer office is... also technically reservable," he admits, rubbing his neck and looking almost pained. "But just as nice! And, uh... look, my real office is technically a cubicle, but compared to the kiosk last time we met? It's a big step up." He shrugs, trying to brush it off. "But hey, we don't need fancy spaces to make serious deals. Let's get back on track, yeah?" He clears his throat.`
	"CN-6202" `	"Absolutely."`
	"CN-6203" `	"Howard, a promotion's a big deal. The office doesn't matter - your work speaks for itself."`
	"CN-6204" `	"Howard, your cubicle is still pathetic. Now, let's get back on track."`
	"CN-6205" `	Howard flinches, his jaw tightening for a moment before he forces a thin smile. "Pathetic or not, it gets the job done," he says quietly, avoiding your gaze as he fidgets with a paperweight on his desk. "Spaceport. Later." His voice is more clipped now, and he doesn't wait for a response before focusing on his work calls, shutting you out entirely.`
	"CN-6206" `	"Thanks, that means a lot. Now, I've got to get back to work."`
	"CN-6207" `	Howard's attention shifts away from you as he begins taking a series of work calls, his tone changing seamlessly from charming to authoritative as he negotiates and makes deals. He mouths two words to you: "Spaceport... later..." It's clear that, for now, Howard is finished with you and you'll get no more information.`
	"CN-6208" `You meet Howard at the spaceport. He's standing on a nearby landing pad next to his Shuttle, dressed sharply but looking a bit hurried. He gives you a quick nod as you approach.`
	"CN-6209" `	"Good to see you're on time," Howard says, glancing at his antique wristwatch. "We've got a lot of ground - or space - to cover." Howard briefly looks at the <ship>. "Your ship ought to go fast enough, I suppose. I'll be tied up in calls for most of the trip, but once we're back at the office, we can talk." He starts toward his Shuttle's ramp, already shifting his attention back to his wristwatch. "Let's get moving."`
	"CN-6210" `As soon as you land, you see a message from Howard:`
	"CN-6211" `	"<first> <last>! Looks like I beat you landing on <planet>! Meet me at my office near the spaceport to talk further. (Again, note the address change.)"`
	"CN-6212" `Even amidst the mix of landing pads, hangars, and cranes, it's hard to miss the Megaparsec corporate office. After a short walk, you reach the towering building. The lobby is sleek and modern, filled with the quiet hum of efficiency. To your surprise the receptionist waves you on and you take an elevator up to the eighth floor, where Howard awaits.`
	"CN-6213" `	The office reminds you of the one you were in on Hephaestus, though more understated. Howard's office is a modest yet modern space, featuring a smart desk, a few sleek chairs, and large windows overlooking the busy shipyards. You can't help noticing that, like the Hephaestus office, the minimalist decor hints more at style than substance.`
	"CN-6214" `	"Glad you could make it," Howard says, extending his hand. "Apologies for the inconvenience, but it's better to discuss these matters away from potentially 'interested' parties." He motions for you to join him at one of the few sleek chairs in the center of the room.`
	"CN-6215" `	(Remain standing.)`
	"CN-6216" `	Howard sits beside you in an oddly intimate expression.`
	"CN-6217" `	Howard shrugs and takes a seat anyway.`
	"CN-6218" `	Once settled, he leans back in his chair and gives you a serious look. "Tell me," he says, "are you familiar with Marauder ships?"`
	"CN-6219" `	"Yes, of course."`
	"CN-6220" `	"No, I can't say I am."`
	"CN-6221" `	Howard raises an eyebrow. "Marauder ships are nasty pieces of work," he explains. "They're ships with numerous modifications - mostly with combat in mind. More shields, weapons, engines, and outfit space, with enough firepower to tear through a lot of defenses before anyone knows what hit them. They're often used by rogue groups that operate outside the law, preying on vulnerable targets."`
	"CN-6222" `	Howard pauses for a moment before continuing. "We at Megaparsec are interested in getting our hands on one. We want to study its design, see what makes it tick. We've received word that a Marauder ship was recently spotted in Oblate. I need you to track it down and disable it. Once it's crippled, our recovery team will handle the rest."`
	"CN-6223" `	He gives you a deliberate look. "Does that sound like a plan?"`
	"CN-6224" `	He gives you a pointed look. "Think you can handle that?"`
	"CN-6225" `	"You got it."`
	"CN-6226" `	"What do you need me for? This sounds like something that the Syndicate could do themselves."`
	"CN-6227" `	"No way, I'm done here."`
	"CN-6228" `	Howard shifts a bit in his seat as he considers your question. "Normally we'd contract Lightspeed Logistics for this sort of job. They've got the expertise and resources to handle something like this cleanly." He pauses, choosing his words carefully. "But they lack the discretion. This particular Marauder ship belongs to a pirate who ran in the same circles as a number of Lightspeed contractors. If we sent them in, I'm concerned they might try to study the ship themselves, tip off the pirate, or worse, tip off others in the Syndicate that Megaparsec is making a move.`
	"CN-6229" `	"That's where you come in. You're outside the usual network, and that gives us a layer of security. Take this job, and it stays between us. No one else needs to know Megaparsec is involved."`
	"CN-6230" `	"Alright, I'm in."`
	"CN-6231" `	"And where does that promised investment opportunity fit in?"`
	"CN-6232" `	"I'm still not interested."`
	"CN-6233" `	Howard's face brightens at the mention of the investment. "Ah, yes, the opportunity. It's much larger than the last deal you were part of, but the returns are still very competitive. You'll need at least ten or maybe twelve million credits to get in on this one."`
	"CN-6234" `	He leans forward. "We're looking to fund a refueling station expansion at our logistics hub on Crossroads. We're between an aggressive option, a more conventional expansion, and a more conservative one."`
	"CN-6235" `	Howard pauses, gauging your reaction before continuing. "All of the options have their merits, though investors usually prefer the one with the most returns. But the choice is yours if you're in. I'll make sure you get the full details once we're done with this little favor in Oblate."`
	"CN-6236" `	"Alright, I'm in. Let's discuss it more after Oblate."`
	"CN-6237" `	"Why would a shipyard have refueling stations?"`
	"CN-6238" `	"None of those options sound good to me. I'm out."`
	"CN-6239" `	Howard clearly enjoys the opportunity to explain. "Megaparsec's shipyards here on Sunracer are our crown jewel, building nearly every one of our ships as well as our high performance aircraft and hovercraft. You cannot imagine the logistics required to get the countless capacitors and microchips from Tinker, Delta V's plasma engines from Solace - heck, we have a dedicated logistics hangar on Crossroads just for shipping the Quicksilver's Particle Cannons! Don't even get me started on the Mantas! Ada's a long ways away, but we sure love Lovelace Labs' products...`
	"CN-6240" `	"Ahem. All that to say, refueling stations, while few, are part of our larger strategy in vertical integration. Refueling stations are the heart of our logistics network for bringing all the parts we need here and for getting various vehicles out of here to be sold across the Republic.`
	"CN-6241" `	"There are, of course, ancillary benefits as well. For R&D, we can test the impact of different fuel mixtures on our ships prior to entering the market. For partnerships, we can include fueling rights in large-scale sales agreements with major corporations or government fleets. At our largest logistics hubs, the economies of scale even allow us to competitively offer refueling services solely to these high-volume operators, giving us a diversified revenue stream.`
	"CN-6242" `	"In fact, the ancillary benefits are largely why there's such discretion in how the expansion will go. The aggressive and conservative fueling options both offer R&D and partnership benefits that are more than the project's direct returns."`
	"CN-6243" `	"That makes sense. Let's discuss the deal more after Oblate."`
	"CN-6244" `	"Thanks for the overview, but I'm still not interested. I'm out."`
	"CN-6245" `	Howard nods with approval. "Excellent. The Marauder ship was last seen near Oblate, in the outer rim of that system. It's likely to be well armed, so stay sharp. Once you've disabled it, head back here and I'll make sure you're properly compensated."`
	"CN-6246" `	He cracks a smile. "I remember the first time we met you left that Vanguard alive. Same deal here, but disable the Marauder. Hopefully that Vanguard's not still around.`
	"CN-6247" `	He leans in slightly, lowering his voice. "Just be careful. We don't want to destroy the ship. Cripple it so we can study it, but don't blow it into oblivion like you did that Vanguard when we first met.`
	"CN-6248" `	"Well, that's all I have for you. Goodbye and good luck!"`
	"CN-6249" `When you enter Moktar, your sensors detect the same pirate Vanguard from when you first rescued Howard. Your ship is immediately hailed, and the pirate opens communication.`
	"CN-6250" `	"I should have destroyed you when I had the chance. Prepare to meet your end!"`
	"CN-6251" `	"Maybe I should have destroyed you!"`
	"CN-6252" `	"Uhhh... who are you again?"`
	"CN-6253" `	"Argh, you slithering, spineless snake! I'll tear your ship apart piece by piece!"`
	"CN-6254" `	"Bah, you banal, bumbling baboon! Prepare to meet your doom!"`
	"CN-6255" `	You can't help feeling a sense of deja vu as the Vanguard's engines roar to life and you see a baker's half-dozen guns take aim at your ship, ready to fire.`
	"CN-6256" `The ship has been disabled. You receive a message from Howard almost immediately:`
	"CN-6257" `	"<first> <last>, you've done it again! Meet me on <destination> to talk about this victory."`
	"CN-6258" `The ship has been destroyed. Like before, you almost immediately receive a message from Howard:`
	"CN-6259" `	"What have you done? I said disable the ship! You've completely destroyed my plans, cost us millions, and ruined any chance of salvaging this operation - how could you possibly mess this up so badly? Don't come back, we're done."`
	"CN-6260" `You arrive back on Sunracer to a spaceport buzzing with activity. You make your way through the bustling shipyard toward the towering Megaparsec building. Entering the lobby, the receptionist gives you a nod, and you quickly ascend to the eighth floor.`
	"CN-6261" `	Howard greets you with a smile as you step into his office. The room is as you left it - modern, modest, and with a clear view of the shipyards below. "Welcome back," he says, gesturing for you to take a seat. "I take it the job in Oblate went smoothly?"`
	"CN-6262" `	"Didn't you message me as soon as I did it?"`
	"CN-6263" `	"True enough, just making conversation," he says with a grin. "The important thing is that the job's done. Now, let's get down to business.`
	"CN-6264" `	"Our recovery team is already retrieving the ship as we speak. You've done well. Here's a payment for that favor, 25,000 credits."`
	"CN-6265" `	"25,000?! You must have forgotten a zero there, you cheapskate!"`
	"CN-6266" `	"I appreciate the offer, but there's no need for payment this time. Consider it purely a favor - I'm happy to help."`
	"CN-6267" `	"That's generous of you, and I appreciate it.`
	"CN-6268" `	"I see... well, let's not make this more difficult than it needs to be," he says in a clipped tone. "I'll transfer another 175,000 credits now to make it an even 200,000. But in the future, I'd appreciate it if you would remember the privilege you have of working with Megaparsec Incorporated.`
	"CN-6269" `	"Now, let's talk about that investment opportunity."`
	"CN-6270" `	Howard pulls up a holographic display on the digital screen behind him. Various charts and projections flash by. "Ready for the pitch?"`
	"CN-6271" `	"You know it."`
	"CN-6272" `	"Here's what we're looking at. Megaparsec Incorporated is expanding a refueling station on Crossroads, and we're likely going to go with a conventional expansion. But don't let the term 'conventional' fool you, because Megaparsec rarely expands its refueling stations - this is the first time in over a decade. When we do, it's because we've identified a strategic location that will skyrocket profits. These opportunities are as rare as they come, and most investors never even hear about them. But you've proven yourself, and that's why you're getting a seat at the table."`
	"CN-6273" `	He pauses, letting the weight of his words sink in. "Getting in on this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. We're talking about a key hub on a high-traffic trade route, with a captive market of ships desperate for fuel. The returns will be solid... and dependable. Opportunities like this don't just come around, and when they do, they go fast."`
	"CN-6274" `	"Thanks, but I'll be speeding away from this investment."`
	"CN-6275" `	"Excellent. The price for this investment is ten million credits for a solid 5400 credit per day return. Don't worry about pulling out your wallet just yet - I've pulled a few strings with our friends at the bank. They're willing to structure a loan for you through our Finance Division, no upfront payment needed. You'll just need to sign a few documents to get things moving."`
	"CN-6276" `	He slides a document over to you, with a sleek pen ready for your signature. "Just sign this first document for the loan and then we can talk through the rest of the documents before signing."`
	"CN-6277" `	"I'm done with these deals, I'm leaving."`
	"CN-6278" `	Howard's tone carries a hint of impatience. "Alright then. The price for this investment is eleven million credits for a 5400 credit per day return. I've managed to arrange a loan through the bank and our Finance Division, so you won't need to come up with the cash immediately. Just sign these documents to formalize the arrangement."`
	"CN-6279" `	He pushes a document over to you, with a very fancy pen ready for your signature. "Just sign this first document for the loan and then we can talk through the rest of the documents before signing."`
	"CN-6280" `	He takes the document from you and you see the loan terms on the screen behind him: 10M credits, 10 years, 34% rate.`
	"CN-6281" `	He snatches the document from you with a wicked smile and you see the loan terms on the screen behind him: 11M credits, 10 years, 44% rate.`
	"CN-6282" `	Howard leans back in his chair. "Well done. You're now part of a very select group, one that's about to see some significant returns. As I mentioned, we're leaning towards a conventional expansion for the refueling station on Crossroads. It's a strategic move and it'll serve the steady stream of ships passing through, locking in profits for years to come of about 5400 credits a day, or around 20% a year."`
	"CN-6283" `	He watches you closely, gauging your reaction. "Of course, this is just the standard approach. There's always room to tweak the plan."`
	"CN-6284" `	Howard pauses, waiting to see if you're interested in taking the conversation further.`
	"CN-6285" `	"Sounds like a good plan to me."`
	"CN-6286" `	"What would it take to boost profits even more?"`
	"CN-6287" `	"What if I have concerns about the environmental impact?"`
	"CN-6288" `	"The conventional expansion is anything but. We'd work with licensed suppliers and build it by the book. Of course, Crossroads is already a radioactive wasteland of sandstorms, so the book's pretty light, all things considered. It's a solid investment with good returns and minimal risk. Nothing too flashy, but reliable returns of about 5400 credits a day, or around 20% a year."`
	"CN-6289" `	"And if I have concerns about the environmental impact?"`
	"CN-6290" `	"Could you remind me about the unregulated option?"`
	"CN-6291" `	"Explain the eco-friendly choice once more."`
	"CN-6292" `	"We could tap into some unregulated fuel sources. No oversight, no regulations. The fuel's cheaper and abundant, but it's volatile - one wrong move, and it's a disaster waiting to happen. The profits, though, are through the roof. For the possible cost of a few lives and some bad PR, we can boost returns to around 8200 credits a day, or about 30% a year."`
	"CN-6293" `	"Bring on the profits, this unregulated option is the one for me."`
	"CN-6294" `	"Tell me about the conventional expansion again."`
	"CN-6295" `	"There's also the eco-friendly route. We'd invest in green energy technologies and refining processes that minimize environmental impact and implement best-in-class workplace safety protocols. It's the most expensive option, and it'll slow our expansion, but it would reduce our environmental liabilities and might give us some goodwill. Easily the worst returns with around 4000 credits a day expected, or just around 15% a year."`
	"CN-6296" `	"This environmental and safety focused option is the one for me."`
	"CN-6297" `	"Excellent choice. The conventional expansion is a safe bet with solid returns. It's not the flashiest option, but the steady stream of ships passing through Crossroads will ensure consistent profits. The only drawback is that it won't make headlines - but it'll keep the credits flowing smoothly."`
	"CN-6298" `	"Well done. The unregulated option is bold and ambitious - exactly the kind of move the Syndicate prizes. The volatility of this fuel isn't for the faint of heart, but some bad PR is well worth the profits and potential earnings we'll achieve. High risk often means high reward."`
	"CN-6299" `	"An admirable decision. The eco-friendly route won't make the most credits, but it's a forward-thinking investment. It could pay off in other ways, like reduced turnover and environmental liabilities. Objectively the worst investment from a returns perspective, but I suppose you value other things more."`
	"CN-6300" `	"Alright, now that we've settled on your investment, let's get the rest of the paperwork squared away." He slides a stack of documents across the desk. "These cover the remaining loan terms, the investment agreement, and the usual legal fine print. Nothing too complicated, just a few signatures to make it all official." He hands you the same sleek pen from earlier, his expression all business. "Once this is done, you'll be a stakeholder in one of Megaparsec's most promising expansions."`
	"CN-6301" `	(Sign the paperwork.)`
	"CN-6302" `	With the last signature in place, Howard gives you a nod of approval. "Congratulations. You've made a smart move today. I'll keep you in mind for future investment opportunities. Who knows, maybe I'll need another Marauder-related favor down the line." He gives you a wink and stands, offering his hand. "Until next time, we'll keep in touch."`
	"CN-6303" `	After that final goodbye, you leave Howard's office, the quiet hum of the corporate floor giving way to the loud clanging of Sunracer's bustling shipyards and spaceport as you head back to the <ship>.`
	"CN-6304" `As you are landing your <model>, you see a message from Howard, the Megaparsec salesman who sold you two investments. The message says:`
	"CN-6305" `	"Hey <first>,`
	"CN-6306" `		"I hope all is well. I'm excited to send you this interim Megaparsec report! I'm sharing because it's the first one with your investment included - check out Section 3, Part C, Paragraph 6 for the details.`
	"CN-6307" `	"Captain <first> <last>,`
	"CN-6308" `		"Here's the interim Megaparsec report, sent because your investment is included for the first time. You can find the relevant information in Section 3, Part C, Paragraph 6.`
	"CN-6309" `		"Nothing major to flag, just routine updates. Steady progress and business as usual. Just like I predicted, we're seeing some solid returns that aren't making headlines. And the higher ups like the consistency - keeps me in their good graces.`
	"CN-6310" `		"Returns are about what we projected, a little slow, but here's the kicker: we're saving a chunk in provisions for expected environmental lawsuits and employee morale at the expansion is through the roof. Looks like we're building more than just profits. My bosses are thrilled - they think I'm working magic here.`
	"CN-6311" `		"There was a... noteworthy incident involving some employees, so it might draw more attention than we'd like. Nothing that'll derail the returns, though, just some bad press to manage. Everything's still on track, and either way, no one can argue with the numbers.`
	"CN-6312" `		"Anyway, here's the mentioned area of that report. I have another investment opportunity coming up, but if my bank contact is correct you have some hustling to do if you want in. Maybe three or four hundred million credits ought to do it. Keep in touch."`
	"CN-6313" `		"Anyway, here's the mentioned area of that report. As long as you stay rich I'll have another investment opportunity for you soon. Keep in touch."`

	"CN-6348" `	You've finally gotten through the report's opening statements. That's more than enough of the main report to go through.`
	"CN-6349" `	(Close the report now that I've gone through the main overview.)`
	"CN-6350" `	You open the attached report to the area indicated by Howard:`
	"CN-6351" `	Crossroads refueling station investments continue to meet projections, with healthy margins and steady returns. Following several modest investments in operational efficiency, returns are tracking slightly above baseline forecasts, ensuring a consistent annualized return to investors. The station's strategic position on the centrally located planet continues to generate strong traffic, further solidifying its long-term profitability.`
	"CN-6352" `	Investment returns from the Crossroads refueling station are currently below comparable benchmarks. However, environmental-related legal actions have been significantly lower than anticipated, resulting in reduced provisions for legal fees. Additionally, localized employee turnover has halved during this period, contributing to enhanced operational stability and providing a favorable outlook for the coming quarters.`
	"CN-6353" `	A serious accident at the Crossroads refueling station resulted in injuries to two dozen employees and one fatality. While the legal ramifications are being addressed, the station's outsized returns have more than compensated for the legal fees incurred due to this unfortunate and unpredictable occurrence. Financial projections remain strong, with returns far exceeding expectations.`
	"CN-6354" `	That marks the end of where the report covers your investment.`
	"CN-6355" `As you are walking around the low stone buildings of the spaceport, you remember that you invested in a refueling station expansion at Megaparsec's logistics hub on Crossroads.`
	"CN-6356" `	(Maybe later.)`
	"CN-6357" `	(Skip visiting the refueling station.)`
	"CN-6358" `	You make your way towards the refueling station on a bulky vehicle closed off from the radioactive air. Nevertheless, you still feel a faint metallic taste in the back of your throat as you see blue and purple tumbleweeds drift with the sand out the window. Eventually you pull up to the depot and refueling station.`
	"CN-6359" `	The structure looms in front of you - sleek, modular, and distinctly industrial. The station is built for efficient refueling, with segmented docking areas for various freighter sizes, fuel lines tangled overhead like mechanical vines snaking down to heavy looking hoses attached to repulsors, and a series of elevated walkways crisscrossing the area.`
	"CN-6360" `	(Get out of the bulky vehicle.)`
	"CN-6361" `	(Turn around and go back to my ship.)`
	"CN-6362" `	While still outside the main area, you exit the vehicle and hear the fueling systems hum, punctuated by the occasional clicks of the fuel pumps. There's a faint sulfuric tang in the air intermixed with the radioactive metallic dust. Large screens display fuel prices and tank levels, while cargo repulsors zip around, transporting supplies to waiting ships. You begin to make your way through narrow steps and low guardrails leading up to a platform overlooking the main fueling bay.`
	"CN-6363" `	As you start to approach the platform, you notice a worker sitting on the edge of a low retaining wall, just outside the main operation zone. He's leaned back, catching his breath and wiping the sweat from his brow. The worker looks up as you near, his expression neutral but open, perhaps surprised to see someone from management on-site. His break seems brief, but he's got a minute or two before heading back to work - giving you the option to engage in conversation or simply move on.`
	"CN-6364" `	As your approach to the platform begins, you notice a worker sitting on the edge of a low retaining wall, just outside the bustling refueling zone. He's leaned back with a relaxed smile on his face as he whistles a cheerful tune, clearly enjoying a well-earned break. The worker's uniform is crisp, and his overall demeanor suggests high morale. He glances up as you near, offering a friendly nod, clearly at ease. With a few minutes left in his break, you have the chance to strike up a conversation or continue on your way.`
	"CN-6365" `	As you start your approach towards the platform, you notice a worker sitting on the edge of a low retaining wall, staring at a small memorial plaque embedded in the ground just outside the main refueling zone. Next to the plaque, two small, unmarked rocks have been carefully placed side by side.`
	"CN-6366" `	The worker seems lost in thought, occasionally wiping the sweat from his brow. He shifts slightly as you draw nearer, offering a subtle nod of acknowledgment, giving you the chance to either continue on or start a conversation with him. The reasons behind the plaque and the stones remain unclear, though their presence feels somber. You think back to Howard's message about your aggressive investment choice causing a "noteworthy incident."`
	"CN-6367" `	(Say hello.)`
	"CN-6368" `	(Let the moment pass and continue on towards the platform.)`
	"CN-6369" `	You decide to strike up a conversation, and after a brief exchange, the worker relaxes when you clarify that you're not from management. His face softens as he shares his story. He grew up poor in the Dirt Belt, and came to Crossroads hoping for something better.`
	"CN-6370" `	"I've been working hard, trying to give my kid a life I didn't have."`
	"CN-6371" `	He shrugs as he says, "Sure, the hours are long and it's tough sometimes, but it beats what you hear about some Syndicate jobs - unsafe, grueling work. At least here, the work's steady and it puts food on the table. That's more than I ever had growing up in the Dirt Belt." He checks the time and stands, dusting off his uniform.`
	"CN-6372" `	"Thanks for the chat, but I've got a long night ahead. It's my kid's birthday, and I'm putting in extra hours so I can get them a cake. They're gonna love it."`
	"CN-6373" `	With a tired but determined smile, he heads back to work, leaving you with a glimpse of the reality behind the "conventional" station's daily grind.`
	"CN-6374" `	You decide to strike up a conversation, and as you exchange pleasantries, the worker mentions how he grew up in the Dirt Belt. He talks about how tough life was back then, scraping by with whatever work he could find before coming to Crossroads in search of something better.`
	"CN-6375" `	"I've been incredibly lucky," he says with a genuine smile. "This job - good pay, safe working conditions, benefits for my family - it's more than I ever imagined. I've heard stories about jobs in the Syndicate, how unsafe and grueling they can be. Heck, I've heard of other refueling stations at this very same logistics hub where people get injured and they're left to starve - can you imagine? I count my blessings every day."`
	"CN-6376" `	He glances at his datapad and stands up, brushing off his uniform. "Thanks for the chat," he says warmly. "I've got to head back in. Calling it an early day today - need to grab a cake and set up a surprise birthday party for my kid. They're going to be thrilled!"`
	"CN-6377" `	With a quick wave, he heads back toward the fueling bay, whistling his tune once again.`
	"CN-6378" `	You decide to say hello and ask about the plaque, and the worker lets out a sharp, bitter scoff. "Management put it up after a fuel explosion killed someone," he says in a cold tone. "Injured dozens more, too. They have us handling some incredibly dangerous fuel, no safety gear, and quotas that are impossible to meet. We all knew it was a disaster waiting to happen. But management?" He pauses to wipe his brow.`
	"CN-6379" `	"They didn't care. They just wanted the job done fast." He glances at the two small rocks, then shifts his gaze to the plaque again beside them. "He was one of the lucky ones."`
	"CN-6380" `	He nods toward the rocks. "Some of the others weren't so lucky to die immediately. They got hurt bad enough that they couldn't keep working, and the burns covering their bodies left them in agony for days. Megaparsec didn't lift a finger to help, no medicine, no credits, nothing. We tried, but they didn't make it.`
	"CN-6381" `	"Management won't admit they had anything to do with it, won't help their families or put their names on a plaque or anything. So a few of us put those stones there. Our own little way of remembering."`
	"CN-6382" `	You take in his words, the weight of them heavy in the air.`
	"CN-6383" `	(Try to change the subject and ask if he has any family.)`
	"CN-6384" `	The worker turns back to the stones, staring at them for a long, uncomfortable silence. Finally, he shakes his head, his voice barely above a whisper.`
	"CN-6385" `	With that, he pushes himself to his feet and heads back to work without another word.`
	"CN-6386" `	(Continue on towards the platform.)`
	"CN-6387" `	(Return to my <model> to leave.)`
	"CN-6388" `	You continue on through the narrow steps leading to get to the platform overlooking the main fueling bay, and go through the doors at the top of the steps to enter the main facility.`
	"CN-6389" `	At the top of platform, you take in the sight below of hurried workers and a massive Container Transport docking, its intermodal containers likely full of Particle Cannons destined for Megaparsec Quicksilvers.`
	"CN-6390" `	Fueling crews move quickly but with a certain impatience, functional but clearly worn gear clanking as they connect the repulsor-mounted refueling hoses to the Container Transport's ports. There's a faint tension in the air, an unspoken acknowledgment that time is money, as the fueling process proceeds with the workers more focused on speed than safety.`
	"CN-6391" `	You take a breath of air that feels thick and grimy, carrying the faint stench of fuel. The environmental controls seem poorly maintained, leaving the atmosphere heavy and uncomfortable. The hum of machinery blends with the occasional cough from workers, who seem used to the less-than-ideal conditions. You see the worker from outside, who gives you a short nod before coughing into his arm and rushing to the next fueling hose.`
	"CN-6392" `	At the top of platform, the sight below is one of smooth coordination and efficiency. A massive Container Transport docks relatively gracefully, its intermodal containers full of Particle Cannons likely destined for Megaparsec Quicksilvers.`
	"CN-6393" `	Workers outfitted in sleek safety gear move with precision, guiding repulsor-mounted refueling hoses to the Container Transport's ports. There's an air of confidence here - a clear, practiced rhythm, as the fueling process proceeds with checks and double-checks.`
	"CN-6394" `	You take a deep breath of clean, crisp air. Even the environmental controls seem well-maintained, keeping the air cleaner than you'd expect in a station of this size. It's almost serene, the hum of machinery blending with the low chatter of workers who seem genuinely at ease, knowing they're well-protected. You catch the eye of the worker you saw earlier outside, and he gives you a wave before turning his attention back to the fueling hoses.`
	"CN-6395" `	The air is thick with tension as you look down at the fueling bay. A massive Container Transport lurches to dock, overloaded with Particle Cannons, as workers scramble like their lives depend on it.`
	"CN-6396" `	What little safety gear you see appears to be an afterthought - you can't imagine the few cracked helmets or thin gloves doing much of anything. The workers frantically pull the volatile fuel hoses forward, the heavy tubes attached to worn repulsors that barely handle their weight. Workers shout over the roar of pumps, rushing to refuel, their movements hurried and desperate.`
	"CN-6397" `	As you inhale, the air sears your lungs, almost choking you into a coughing fit. It's suffocating, laden with the sharp, toxic stench of volatile fuel. The entire platform feels like it's teetering on the edge of catastrophe. Every second here feels dangerous, the air thick with the threat of a disaster waiting to happen. The hum of machinery feels ominous against the gasping breaths of workers, whose tense, hurried movements suggest they're all too aware of the dangerous conditions around them. Everyone here appears equally broken and sullen, and you can't make out the worker you saw earlier from the crowd.`
	"CN-6398" `	(Take in the scene.)`
	"CN-6399" `	(Walk back to the vehicle.)`
	"CN-6400" `	You take in the scene for another moment, the sounds of the station filling the air as you stand on the platform. You give the area one last glance before heading back down to return to the spaceport in the bulky vehicle that took you here. The faint metallic taste of the radioactive air returns as you leave the refueling station, blending with the steady hum of the vehicle's repulsor engine.`
	"CN-6401" `	The long journey back to the spaceport proceeds in silence, leaving your decision behind to echo through the lives of the people left here.`
	"CN-6402" `After an uneventful walk through the spaceport, you return to the <ship> to see a message from Howard, the Megaparsec salesman who sold you two investments. The message says:`
	"CN-6403" `	After an uneventful trip through the spaceport, you remember saving a message from Howard, the Megaparsec salesman you've already invested with twice. The message says:`
	"CN-6404" `	"Dear <first>,`
	"CN-6405" `	"I trust that all is well with you. I am pleased to share that the investment opportunity I mentioned in my last message has now arrived. I truly value our partnership and the trust you've placed in me, and I'm confident this next venture will be a great fit for your ambitions.`
	"CN-6406" `	"Please meet me on Sunracer at your earliest convenience so we can review the details together. I look forward to catching up and discussing our next steps."`
	"CN-6407" `	"I trust you've reviewed the interim Megaparsec report I last sent you. The investment opportunity I previously mentioned is now available. I expect you to meet me on Sunracer at your earliest convenience to finalize the details. I look forward to discussing next steps to close this deal promptly."`
	"CN-6408" `	(Save the message to look at later.)`
	"CN-6409" `	"Thank you for reaching out. I am currently out of the office and will respond to your message as soon as possible.`
	"CN-6410" `	"For urgent matters, please contact our support team."`
	"CN-6411" `Howard sends you a reminder of his address near the spaceport as you land your <model> on <planet> - curiously on the ninth floor of the Megaparsec corporate office, rather than the eighth floor you met him on last time. He must still be reserving conference rooms for these meetings.`
	"CN-6412" `After a short walk through the bustling spaceport, you reach Megaparsec's sky-scraping corporate office. The sleek and modern lobby evokes the fast, light ships they're known for, with polished surfaces, elegant furniture, and subtle lighting coming together seamlessly.`
	"CN-6413" `	The receptionist greets you with a nod and a warm smile, either remembering you from your prior visits or merely being polite. The elevator ride up to the ninth floor is smooth, the soft hum of machinery fading away as you walk through the elevator doors. Howard's office is modern yet modest, featuring a central smart desk, a few sleek chairs, and large windows overlooking the busy shipyards. Howard himself stands at one of the expansive windows, looking out at Megaparsec's shipyards below.`
	"CN-6414" `	"Glad you could make it," he says, his voice cordial and confident. "This investment opportunity for you is ten times larger than our last deal - but first I need a small favor."`
	"CN-6415" `	Howard's gaze doesn't shift from the glass as he says, "You're here. Good. This investment opportunity is ten times larger than the last one - but first I need a small favor."`
	"CN-6416" `	He turns to face you. "We're on the cusp of greatness."`
	"CN-6417" `	"You didn't mention any favor in your message."`
	"CN-6418" `	"Am I going to have to jump through hoops for every investment you offer?"`
	"CN-6419" `	"The cusp of greatness?"`
	"CN-6420" `	"That's a bit dramatic with the window, no?"`
	"CN-6421" `	Howard raises an amused eyebrow and remarks, "Relax, it's nothing you can't handle. Just a minor detour on this road to greatness."`
	"CN-6422" `	He turns back towards the window. "Greatness. My own corner office, a luxurious company ship, not to mention a sizable bonus. Director... all I need from you is to help nudge a small event in our favor."`
	"CN-6423" `	"What kind of nudge?"`
	"CN-6424" `	"The 'greatness' you're talking about is just another promotion?"`
	"CN-6425" `	Yet again he briefly turns from the window to face you.`
	"CN-6426" `	"Of course.`
	"CN-6427" `	"Said nudge entails a certain degree of discretion and precision. You've demonstrated that during our Marauder acquisition; now we need it for an excision. I need you to plant some evidence onto a ship in <waypoints> to bait the pirates there into attacking a research convoy. Then, regroup on <planet> before the convoy comes through next week, and that should definitively shut down the Marauder project. After the anticipated response by the pirates, we confirm on <planet> that there's no loose ends."`
	"CN-6428" `	Howard continues to watch the shipyards below for a long moment before turning from the window with a deliberate finality, and strides to his desk at the center of the room. Planting both hands firmly on the smooth surface, he meets your gaze with an unusual intensity and says, "I need you to kick a hornets' nest and to make sure those hornets sting."`
	"CN-6429" `	"Stinging hornets and nest kicking. You got it."`
	"CN-6430" `	"Last time I helped you start your Marauder project, and now you want me to end it? What's going on, Howard?"`
	"CN-6431" `	Howard exhales, shaking his head with a knowing smile. "Starting the Marauder project got me here, but keeping it alive? That won't help me get to the next level." Howard leans casually against the desk, his tone becoming more familiar but still businesslike. "The engineers are whispering that mass production doesn't look feasible. That's bad news for me if the higher-ups catch wind of it before we can control the narrative."`
	"CN-6432" `	Howard exhales sharply as his eyes narrow in irritation. "Starting the Marauder project served its purpose, but now? It's a liability." At the last word, his gaze flicks over you. "Let's just say it's run its course; I need it shut down before anyone starts asking questions that I can't answer."`
	"CN-6433" `	Howard's tone remains measured, but there's a calculated edge to it now. "So, we make sure the Marauder project dies for the right reasons before anyone starts asking the wrong questions. If, say, an unfortunate pirate attack conveniently wipes out key research and a few critical components, the whole project becomes unsalvageable. Lightspeed Logistics is responsible for security, not me, so if the whole thing goes up in flames, my reputation remains intact - just another casualty of circumstance. Then there'll be nothing standing in the way of my promotion, and I get a new corner office."`
	"CN-6434" `	He spreads his hands in a benevolent gesture. "It's the perfect exit strategy. No loose ends. And if there's anyone I trust to make this happen, it's you."`
	"CN-6435" `	He spreads his hands, as if the whole thing is just another transaction. "It's a clean exit. No loose ends. All I need is for you to make it happen."`
	"CN-6436" `	"This all seems a bit more... cutthroat than before."`
	"CN-6437" `	"This is too underhanded for me. I'm not working with you anymore."`
	"CN-6438" `	Howard's eyes soften as he meets your gaze, a fond smile playing on his lips. "Cutthroat? How far we've come since you saved me from that pirate in Moktar. Every hard move has been a stepping stone as we climb to the peak of this ruthless world. And when I reach the top, I won't forget the loyalty that got me there."`
	"CN-6439" `	"Me? Cutthroat?" Howard maintains a hard gaze as he gives you an exaggerated wink, "Don't you forget it. I appreciate what you did on Moktar, but business is business. It's a ruthless world, and all we can do is climb to the top or be trampled beneath." Begrudgingly, he adds, "And I don't forget those who help me get there."`
	"CN-6440" `	Wistfully, Howard adds, "Moktar. The Golden Jewel. I wonder if that ship's still flying out there...`
	"CN-6441" `	Wistfully, Howard adds, "Moktar. The Golden Jewel. Almost a shame that pirate captain isn't flying around anymore...`
	"CN-6442" `	"Anyway, back to the ask. Think you can plant evidence on a Quicksilver in <waypoints>, then make sure it turns into wreckage, and get to <planet> before <day>? Once you're on <planet>, I might need you to tie off any loose ends... but then we can move along to talking about that nine-figure investment. What do you say?"`
	"CN-6443" `	"I'm in, let's do it."`
	"CN-6444" `	"How can I possibly plant evidence on a crewed ship without anyone knowing?"`
	"CN-6445" `	"I'm out; we're through."`
	"CN-6446" `	"That's the neat part, you won't have to. You'll be planting the evidence on an automated prototype vessel. The technology's under wraps, and still in the testing phases. Anyway, there's no one on the ship. And I want you to load it up with this file." He holds up a data disk. "It contains the real timing and defenses of the convoy that's moving that vital Marauder research in a few days, as well as fake data indicating untold riches aboard to entice the pirates."`
	"CN-6447" `	"That's the neat part, you won't have to. You'll be planting the evidence on an automated prototype vessel. Funnily enough, records indicate that you've even been offered to test them before, so you know that technology is still very much in the testing phases. Anyway, there's no one on the ship. And I want you to load it up with this file." He holds up a data disk. "It contains the real timing and defenses of the convoy that's moving that vital Marauder research in a few days, as well as fake data indicating untold riches aboard to entice the pirates."`
	"CN-6448" `	"Okay, great. Makes sense to me."`
	"CN-6449" `	"Why don't I just blow up the ship while I'm still on board?"`
	"CN-6450" `	"Blowing it up from the inside wouldn't do - we need it to look like a proper pirate attack. The wreckage signatures would betray an internal explosion rather than an external assault, and such a sabotage would look laughably amateur. Then I'd be drowning in a thorough investigation neither of us can afford."`
	"CN-6451" `	"I'm in."`
	"CN-6452" `	"Not interested. I'm done with these tasks."`
	"CN-6453" `	He hands you a data disk containing the evidence. "I knew you'd make the right decision. Remember, we really want to kick the hornet's nest here. I've disabled the Quicksilver in <waypoints>, so it should be a cinch for you to upload this evidence onto the ship and ensure its destruction. Remember, first board, then blast. Meet me on <planet> afterwards for any follow-ups. See you in a week."`
	"CN-6454" `When you enter Moktar, your sensors detect a familiar pirate Vanguard. Your ship is immediately hailed, and the pirate opens communication.`
	"CN-6455" `	"If it isn't a pitiful, perplexing parasite, popping up to plague my peace once more!"`
	"CN-6456" `	"We can't keep meeting like this."`
	"CN-6457" `	"Our paths are as powerfully painful as the pestilence - your persistent presence has provoked my peevishness!"`
	"CN-6458" `	"I am the relentless, raging rapscallion who revels in ripping apart feeble, fumbling fiends!"`
	"CN-6459" `You receive a message from Howard almost immediately upon entering the system:`
	"CN-6460" `	"Alright, you're here. Get aboard the Quicksilver to upload the file, make sure it doesn't leave the system in one piece, and finally meet back on <destination>. Remember, no loose ends here."`
	"CN-6461" `Howard sends you a message as your <model> descends to the planet:`
	"CN-6462" `	"What are you doing? Get back up there, board the Quicksilver, and finish the job. We're running out of time and we can't afford mistakes."`
	"CN-6463" `As you maneuver your <model> onto the flat, ancient mesa that's considered spaceport parking, your ship's comms light up with a message:`
	"CN-6464" `	"Excellent work, Captain. My Shuttle's waiting just outside the spaceport - please meet me there immediately. I appreciate your swift action on this.`
	"CN-6465" `	"Good work. My Shuttle is parked just outside the spaceport - meet me there immediately so we can proceed without further delay. No time to waste."`
	"CN-6466" `You step out on the stone field surrounding Canyon's spaceport and quickly locate Howard's Shuttle in an open patch with a wide berth. Climbing aboard, you find Howard waiting, and he greets you with a measured nod.`
	"CN-6467" `	"Again, outstanding work, <first>," he says with a satisfied tone.`
	"CN-6468" `	"Job's done," he states flatly.`
	"CN-6469" `	"The pirates hit the convoy exactly as planned - the Marauder Project's vital components are all lost, with no loose ends left behind. They'll have no choice but to axe the project, and my bosses don't suspect a thing.`
	"CN-6470" `	"One last step for that promotion - I need you to escort me to Hephaestus so I can secure a few formal promotion recommendations from Syndicate leadership, then we finalize that investment. Ready to go?"`
	"CN-6471" `	"Ready as ever."`
	"CN-6472" `	"Another favor?"`
	"CN-6473" `	"Why do you need an escort?"`
	"CN-6474" `	"I'm through with your needs. I'm done with this."`
	"CN-6475" `	"Because this stunt's painted a target on my back. My bosses suspect nothing - but I'm sure Lightspeed Logistics already smells foul play and is less than pleased about the embarrassment. They have plenty of pirate contacts willing to collect a bounty. I need you as a deterrent until I can clinch the promotion with those endorsements.`
	"CN-6476" `	"Escort me to <planet> to secure my promotion and guide me back to Sunracer, then we can talk through and finalize that investment. Perhaps it's two favors then.`
	"CN-6477" `	"We get that done, then we pen in that investment and both walk away richer than ever. All part of the grand plan - what do you say?"`
	"CN-6478" `	"Get it done and we both profit. Ready?"`
	"CN-6479" `	"I'm out."`
	"CN-6480" `	Howard stares at you, dumbfounded. After a long moment, he scoffs, then laughs - sharp and nervous. "You're out? You can't be out - not after this! You think Lightspeed won't come for me - won't come for you? I'll tell them any..." Howard pauses, takes a deep breath, and straightens his collar.`
	"CN-6481" `	"Look. Just get me to <planet>, I'll lock in that promotion, and back to Sunracer - then we talk investments. You've already done the hard part, don't you want to reap the rewards of your efforts? It's right there."`
	"CN-6482" `	He leans in, voice low and persuasive, "You've come this far - don't walk away with the finish line in sight."`
	"CN-6483" `	"I told you, we're through. I'm leaving."`
	"CN-6484" `Your ship arrives amidst the sprawling metropolis of the Syndicate. You lose sight of Howard's Shuttle as you land your <model>, but nevertheless get a parting message from him:`
	"CN-6485" `	"Captain <last>, I'll be in touch in a few days for the investment once some schmoozing has secured my promotion. Stay sharp."`
	"CN-6486" `After a few days, you get a triumphant message from Howard:`
	"CN-6487" `	"<first> <last>,`
	"CN-6488" `	"Promotion secured. Meet me here on <destination> to escort me back to Sunracer - I've got a new ship and office to show you. And of course plans to finalize our nine-figure credit investment."`
	"CN-6489" `		Director of Investor Relations & External Projects, Megaparsec Incorporated`
	"CN-6490" `	(Message back a heartfelt congratulations and that I'm on my way.)`
	"CN-6491" `	(Respond that nobody cares about his promotion, but I'll be there soon.)`
	"CN-6492" `	You immediately receive a response:`
	"CN-6493" `	"<first>,`
	"CN-6494" `	"Appreciate that. Thank you for the kind words. Looking forward to seeing you soon."`
	"CN-6495" `	It would seem Howard's responses aren't all automated messages.`
	"CN-6496" `	"You tihnk I care what you care abuot? Get here. Now."`
	"CN-6497" `	Howard must be seething to miss typos.`
	"CN-6498" `Like clockwork, you get a message from Howard as the <ship> lands on <destination>:`
	"CN-6499" `	"Welcome back. Meet me at the spaceport so we can get back to Sunracer. And take a moment to check out my new ship - I think you'll be impressed."`
	"CN-6500" `	"I see you've arrived. Meet me at the spaceport to escort me back to Sunracer. I have an impressive new ship - get here as soon as possible."`
	"CN-6501" `You step into Hephaestus' bustling spaceport, where the flash of arc welders and the clamor of robotic gantries set the relentless, industrial rhythm of the Syndicate. Amid the busy hangars, you spot Howard standing beside a brand-new Bounder - the sleek vessel cutting a striking figure against the hangar's harsh backdrop of chrome and concrete.`
	"CN-6502" `	Howard flashes you a proud smile as he beckons you closer. "Take a good look - what do you think?"`
	"CN-6503" `	"It's alright, I suppose. Gets the job done."`
	"CN-6504" `	"This ship is a stunner - it really shines above the rest."`
	"CN-6505" `	"Just another pathetic piece of scrap."`
	"CN-6506" `	Howard nods, a slight edge of disappoint in his voice. "Fine, let's move on."`
	"CN-6507" `	Howard's grin widens, his tone warm. "Glad you see it that way. I knew it'd catch your eye."`
	"CN-6508" `	Howard's face darkens, hurt barely concealed as he snaps, "I thought you'd have better taste. But we have work to do."`
	"CN-6509" `	Without missing a beat, Howard adds, "Enough talk. No time to waste, let's get to Sunracer." He strides inside his Bounder, and with a roar of engines he takes off for the journey ahead, with your ship behind him.`
	"CN-6510" `As you land on Sunracer, Howard's Bounder touches down out of view. His office is still at Megaparsec's main building, but now on the 42nd floor rather than the eighth or ninth floors.`
	"CN-6511" `	You make your way through Sunracer's now-familiar terminals to the towering Megaparsec corporate office. Inside, the lobby exudes tasteful sophistication, polished surfaces accented by subtle, ambient lighting and a quiet hum of high-end technology. You are waved in by the receptionist and step into the elevator, and it takes noticeably longer than your previous rides - a deliberate and steady ascent.`
	"CN-6512" `	The elevator doors finally part to reveal the 42nd floor, a realm of refined elegance. Howard's corner office is a far cry from his modest reservable offices he had before. A custom-built smart desk commands the center, flanked by designer seating and accented by carefully curated art that whispers of ambition. Expansive windows frame a dynamic vista of the shipyards below - a living testament to the relentless innovation of Megaparsec. Standing at the window with quiet authority, Howard meets your gaze, a man unmistakably on his own deliberate ascent through the ranks of Megaparsec.`
	"CN-6513" `	He nods in acknowledgment as you step forward, the promise of new ventures electrifying the air.`
	"CN-6514" `	"Howard."`
	"CN-6515" `	"Howard! This new office - magnificent. The view, the art, the power. Quite the upgrade. Well done."`
	"CN-6516" `	"Still dramatic with the window I see, like some tragic corporate philosopher."`
	"CN-6517" `	"<first>. Quite the ride up, wasn't it? Deliberate. Measured. An inevitable accession.`
	"CN-6518" `	Howard looks visibly pleased. "Ah, you have an eye for refinement."`
	"CN-6519" `	Howard's expression momentarily tightens, before putting on a practiced smile. "Ah, your charm remains... distinct. I find a view helps with perspective."`
	"CN-6520" `	Howard walks from the window towards the room's premier art piece, a canvas covered in bold, sweeping strokes of silver and blue. Howard gazes at the lines, "They evoke a rush of light and momentum, symbolizing Megaparsec's drive ever upwards towards uncharted horizons.`
	"CN-6521" `	"But we aren't here for an art tour. We're here to discuss your chance to invest in Megaparsec's new CRUCIBLE Facility."`
	"CN-6522" `	"Crucible?"`
	"CN-6523" `	"'Crossroads Rugged Undertaking, Critically Innovative Benchmarking & Launch Evaluation' Facility. CRUCIBLE.`
	"CN-6524" `	"This isn't just another investment, it's a chance to push our high-performance vehicles to their absolute limits in one of the galaxy's harshest environments. Out on Crossroads, Mother Nature herself runs a full battery of tests: natural sandstorms, searing radiation, rugged terrain - conditions so extreme they would cost a fortune to simulate in a lab anywhere else.`
	"CN-6525" `	"By leveraging Crossroads' environment, our prototypes can be exposed to real-world, relentless conditions that will let us rapidly validate a design's durability and performance. It's the ultimate trial by radioactive fire - our very best vehicles battle-tested against nature's worst.`
	"CN-6526" `	"Your investment isn't just a stake in a facility. As is typical for these types of grand investments, a new business entity will be set up to construct and manage the property, while Megaparsec signs an indefinite lease. That means you'll enjoy a steady income from those leasing fees regardless of the ups and downs of vehicle sales. You're not just fueling innovation, you'll be securing reliable returns while we revolutionize performance testing.`
	"CN-6527" `	"I know that you're a solid, by-the-book investor. This project plays to our strengths and ensures steady, proven returns through rigorous, real-world testing. No surprises.`
	"CN-6528" `	"Given your last investment, I know that you care about things beyond profits. This is a chance to commit to eco-friendly innovation and safer work practices. Here, we can set new standards for performance and for doing good.`
	"CN-6529" `	"Given your last foray into unregulated fuel sources, I know that you're looking for sky-high returns here. There's options here to cut through red tape and to make this facility a real profit multiplier.`
	"CN-6530" `	"Now, the price for this investment is one hundred million credits for a robust 27,400 credits per day. And just like last time, no need to pull out your wallet - I can still pull a few strings with our friends at the bank and our Finance Division. For you, I've even talked them down to half interest. You'll just need to sign a few documents to get things moving."`
	"CN-6531" `	(Sign the loan.)`
	"CN-6532" `	"I'm done with these deals. I'm leaving."`
	"CN-6533" `	Howard's tone carries a hint of impatience. "Now, the price for this investment is one hundred and eleven million credits for a 27,400 credit per day return. I've arranged a loan for you at the bank and through our Finance Division, so you won't need to come up with the investment immediately. I've talked down the loan's interest to be half as high as your prior loan. Just sign these documents to formalize the arrangement."`
	"CN-6534" `	He shoves a document over to you, with a flimsy pen ready for your signature. "Just sign this first document for the loan and then we can talk through the rest of the documents before signing."`
	"CN-6535" `	Howard lets out a sharp breath, shaking his head in disbelief. "So that's it, then?" His expression hardens. "It's your right, of course, to walk away from the opportunity of a lifetime - one I promise you won't see again. But perhaps I misheard you... are you truly done with this deal?"`
	"CN-6536" `	"You must have misheard - I said, 'I'm stunned by these deals, I'm agreeing.'" (Sign the loan.)`
	"CN-6537" `	"I'm done signing these dumpy deals with your bargain-bin pens. Goodbye, Howard."`
	"CN-6538" `	He takes the document from you and you see the loan terms on the screen behind him: 100M credits, 20 years, 16% rate.`
	"CN-6539" `	He snatches the document from you with a wicked smile and you see the loan terms on the screen behind him: 111M credits, 20 years, 20% rate.`
	"CN-6540" `	Howard leans back in his chair. "Well done. You're now a significant, valuable partner to Megaparsec's business interests. We're considering a conventional launch of our testing facility on Crossroads - a balanced, by-the-book approach that promises steady, reliable returns."`
	"CN-6541" `	He eyes you carefully, gauging your reaction. "Of course, that's just one framework - there's always room to tweak the plan. What direction excites you more: unbridled profit, sticking with stability, or making a positive impact?`
	"CN-6542" `	After a moment, Howard adds, "Knowing you, I'd imagine we want to stick with stability, am I right?"`
	"CN-6543" `	After a moment, Howard adds, "Knowing you, I could voice over the plan that goes beyond profits towards more public good?"`
	"CN-6544" `	After a moment, Howard adds, "Knowing you, I could dive right into how we can cut red tape for that unbridled profit."`
	"CN-6545" `	Howard pauses, waiting on your reaction.`
	"CN-6546" `	"I'll stick with stability, that's the choice for me."`
	"CN-6547" `	"What would that 'unbridled profit' entail?"`
	"CN-6548" `	"Tell me about how this can make a positive impact?"`
	"CN-6549" `	"The conventional facility delivers a solid, balanced approach. We use well-established testing protocols that meet regulatory standards while delivering steady, respectable returns. It's a safe, time-tested strategy that rewards disciplined execution without unnecessary risks, offering about 27,400 credits a day, or roughly 10% annually."`
	"CN-6550" `	"And if I have concerns about making a positive impact?"`
	"CN-6551" `	"Could you remind me about the more profitable option?"`
	"CN-6552" `	"Explain the 'genuine good' choice once more."`
	"CN-6553" `	"There's a certain allure to uncompromising profit - a no-holds-barred, red-tape-free approach. We cut every corner on labor, safety, and the environment to unlock some explosive returns. It's the high-stakes, high-return option for those unafraid of a little controversy for rapid gains of 41,000 credits a day, or around 14% a year."`
	"CN-6554" `	He grins. "And as for those little controversies? Don't worry about it - they didn't matter last time, and the odds of another cropping up with this project are probably slim."`
	"CN-6555" `	"Bring on the profits, this uncompromising option is the one for me."`
	"CN-6556" `	"Tell me about the conventional facility again."`
	"CN-6557" `	"And if I have concerns about the environmental or labor impact?"`
	"CN-6558" `	"Explain the 'positive good' choice once more."`
	"CN-6559" `	"You could opt for a more 'genuine good' approach with an eco-friendly, people-first facility. We invest in green technologies and world-class safety protocols, nurturing a work environment with better conditions and community integration - though of course at the cost of profit, returning 20,400 credits a day, or just around 7% a year."`
	"CN-6560" `	"This people-first facility is the one for me."`
	"CN-6561" `	"Could you remind me about the maximum profit option?"`
	"CN-6562" `	Howard nods appreciatively, his tone businesslike. "Congratulations - your choice reinforces Megaparsec's commitment to steady, risk-mitigated growth. This approach will deliver reliable performance and predictable returns, all while maintaining rigorous quality and safety standards. It's not always about flashy headlines; it's about long-term profitability with minimal surprises."`
	"CN-6563" `	Howard leans forward with a calculated gleam in his eye. "Excellent choice - it's a high-octane approach where we push every boundary to extract maximum profit. Think of your high returns, while Megaparsec gets rapid product cycles and a clear market edge. Minor bumps in the PR and labor front are just part of the cost of being a true trailblazer."`
	"CN-6564" `	Howard's expression softens as he speaks. "Well done - your choice speaks volumes about your commitment to ethical standards, sustainability, and worker well-being. While the monetary returns are unquestionably the worst offered to you, I'm sure it'll still build lasting value for Megaparsec through the more intangible benefits of enhanced community goodwill, reduced environmental liabilities, and robust employee loyalty."`
	"CN-6565" `	He smiles. "Great, now that we've locked in your investment, let's get the remaining paperwork squared away." He slides a stack of documents across the desk. "These include the last of the remaining loan terms, the investment agreement for the testing facility, and the standard legal fine print. At this point, you know the drill - just a few signatures to seal the deal." He hands you a sleek pen, his gaze businesslike. "Once this is done, you'll be a stakeholder in one of Megaparsec's most innovative projects to redefine performance testing on Crossroads."`
	"CN-6566" `	With the last signature in place, Howard nods in approval. "Congratulations. You've made an excellent decision today. I'll certainly keep you in mind for future opportunities. You know me, and I know who to call to invest when the next groundbreaking project comes around." He offers a firm handshake and a confident smile. "Until next time. Keep in touch."`
	"CN-6567" `	After that last goodbye, you leave Howard's office. The quiet within gives way to the steady hum of machinery as you walk through the elevator doors, beginning your long descent back to the ground - and to your next opportunity.`
	"CN-6568" `Upon completing your jump, one of your internal sensors begins to beep. You flick off the siren and check the diagnostic report: apparently there is a non-negligible heat source detected in the food storage of your ship.`
	"CN-6569" `Upon taking off, one of your internal sensors begins to beep. You flick off the siren and check the diagnostic report: apparently there is a non-negligible heat source detected in the food storage of your ship.`
	"CN-6570" `	As problems go, it is not a particularly alarming one: there are plenty of reasons there may be a heat spike in storage, and most of them would not require the captain of the ship to investigate.`
	"CN-6571" `	It is unusual, however.`
	"CN-6572" `	(Ignore the sensor.)`
	"CN-6573" `	You turn off the alarm and return your focus to piloting your ship.`
	"CN-6574" `	After a short search, and the rearranging of quite a few deceptively heavy boxes, you are able to track the heat signature to a foodstuff crate you recently took on. It has yet to be opened, but you can tell its seal has already been tampered with.`
	"CN-6575" `	(Open the crate.)`
	"CN-6576" `	(Dump the crate out the airlock.)`
	"CN-6577" `	As the crate tumbles out into lifeless space your onboard sensors quickly note the anomalous heat signature disappear. Whatever was in that crate is no longer your problem, and probably won't be anyone else's either.`
	"CN-6578" `	You pry open the crate. It should be full of meals for your journey, but after removing the lid you discover a dirty, disheveled man.`
	"CN-6579" `	Before you have a chance to say anything, the man looks up at you with narrowed, pained eyes, and whimpers. "P-p-please. I just had to get away. I-I-It wasn't safe. I had to get away." He weakly holds up his hands.`
	"CN-6580" `	"Where's my food?"`
	"CN-6581" `	"T-T-Timothy Radrickson. I-I tossed your food out to make room. I am sorry. I am so sorry. I have no money to pay you back. I just h-h-had to leave. They were after me. I owed money. I had nothing. Please. Any other world will do. I just need to get away. I just need to start anew. I'll p-p-pay you back, I swear. I swear. I will. I swear."`
	"CN-6582" `	"Is there somewhere you'd like to go?"`
	"CN-6583" `	"Fine. I'll drop you off at the next port."`
	"CN-6584" `	"I know where you're going. The airlock."`
	"CN-6585" `	The feeble man screams as you drag him out of the crate and toward the airlock. He ineptly squirms as you shove him past the bulkhead seals. He falls to his knees shuddering, and he scrunches up with terror. You close the airlock, silencing his shrill screams, and hit the button to open the outside airlock. The man is promptly sucked out into cold, cruel space and crystallizes before becoming this system's newest comet.`
	"CN-6586" `	"Thank you," he whispers as tears squeeze out of his eyes. "Thank you."`
	"CN-6587" `	You get the man cleaned up and settled, and then go back to running your ship.`
	"CN-6588" `	Timothy looks at you, his eyes wide and full of tears. "Rand," he whispers. "Rand. I can make good money there. I can turn my life around. B-b-but I'd be okay with anywhere. You d-d-don't have to.."`
	"CN-6589" `	You cut him off. "It's fine, Timothy. I'll take you to Rand."`
	"CN-6590" `	Timothy breaks down in tears. "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you..." he mumbles over and over again.`
	"CN-6591" `	You help him out of the crate and get him cleaned up.`
	"CN-6592" `During the trip Timothy's spirits and health improved, and by the time you arrive on Rand he seems like a different man. Before he steps out of the airlock he turns to you one more time. "Thank you so much, Captain <last>." He shakes your hand.`
	"CN-6593" `	"I mean it, from the bottom of my heart. You've saved my life, and given me hope. I won't forget this; or you. I could never thank you enough."`
	"CN-6594" `	His eyes glistening, Timothy turns from you and exits your ship.`
	"CN-6595" `For days there's been an odd lingering scent filtering in from your pressurized cargo, but finally the smell has permeated your command deck. A ship-wide search leads you to a unopened foodstuff crate. Although the crate is unopened, the seal on it appears tampered with and you surmise that the food has gone bad.`
	"CN-6596" `	Upon opening it you discover that is in fact, not the case. Instead you discover the decaying body of a dead and forgotten stowaway; the entire crate promptly finds its way to your airlock. Despite the diligent work of your ship's air filters, you can't quite rid the ship of the smell.`
	"CN-6597" `Blinking at the light, Timothy shuffles toward the exit. "Th-th-thank you. Thank you so much," Timothy mumbles.`
	"CN-6598" `	Timothy opens the hatch and looks back at you. "You s-s-saved my life. I won't forget. I won't."`
	"CN-6599" `	With that, Timothy exits your ship and begins his new life.`
	"CN-6600" `After your ship touches down you notice a light blinking on your dashboard. You have a cached message waiting for you to play.`
	"CN-6601" `	(Play the message.)`
	"CN-6602" `	The screen lights up with a somewhat familiar man, but it is only when you see the name of the sender that you realize that this is the fuller face of a healthy Timothy Radrickson, whom you last met as a stowaway on your ship.`
	"CN-6603" `	"Captain <last>. Let me just reiterate my thanks to you for what you did for me. Most captains would have airlocked me, or dropped me off wherever, but you really gave me a chance."`
	"CN-6604" `	He stops and grins at the camera for a moment. "And that chance, it really has made all the difference. It's been a year of hard work, but I've saved some money and made some investments, and things really are turning around."`
	"CN-6605" `	"By way of thanks," he continues, "I've included <payment> with this message. That should cover the cost of transporting me to Rand, but it doesn't come close to what I really owe. Which is, in all honesty, my very life."`
	"CN-6606" `	He pauses, as if he's trying to remember something. "Anyways, thank you again, and know I'll never forget what you did for me."`
	"CN-6607" `	Timothy waves, and the video ends.`
	"CN-6608" `An indicator light is blinking on your main panel. There is a cached message waiting for you to play.`
	"CN-6609" `	A young woman in very professional clothing appears on the screen. "Captain <last>, I am pleased to inform you that the Governor of Rand requests your presence. Please come to Rand at your earliest convenience.`
	"CN-6610" `Upon landing you are met by a squat, heavy-set woman in her late forties. She reaches out a calloused hand to shake yours. "Welcome to Rand, Captain <last>. It is a pleasure, and honor, to have someone of your status here on our little world. I am Regina, the mayor of this town, and one of the major company-bosses here. I've been instructed to escort you to the Governor's mansion. I have a vehicle waiting for you just outside the spaceport. Meet me there when you're ready."`
	"CN-6611" `Regina, her driver, and a sleek black vehicle are all waiting for you outside the worn down and substandard spaceport. You slide into the comfortable seating and look out the window as the dry, ugly landscape of Rand passes you by. From time to time you see a strip mine or a camp of workers' barracks, but rarely anything else. Behind your vehicle there is a huge plume of half-frozen dust. Apparently low gravity and thin topsoil is a terrible combination.`
	"CN-6612" `	After an hour of driving you notice the landscape suddenly shift. The first tendrils of greenery invade the otherwise brown-yellow desert. Upon closer inspection, the green plants are accompanied by all manner of technology to help and promote their growth. Money, it seems, is turning just a little bit of this parched place green.`
	"CN-6613" `	Beyond the suddenly green hills sits a huge sprawling complex. You recognize a few massive structures outside the building as artificial gravity drives; the same sort of drives ships use to maintain gravity onboard, but for an entire estate.`
	"CN-6614" `	(Ask about the artificial gravity drives.)`
	"CN-6615" `	Regina flashes a toothy smile. "The gravity here, it is... taxing. The governor's mansion, and a few other important buildings and housing complexes, use artificial gravity drives to make things more manageable for us hard-working 'servants of the state.'" The way she says "servants of the state" makes it sound like some kind of inside joke. She turns away from you before you have a chance to say anything else.`
	"CN-6616" `	The vehicle pulls up to a grandiose entrance near the center of the huge structure. An attendant opens the door, and you're ushered outside the vehicle.`
	"CN-6617" `	Regina does not get out. She smiles politely through the opened door. "Only you were invited to enter the Governor's Mansion. I am afraid this as far as I am allowed to go. Take care, Captain <last>. It truly was an honor meeting you."`
	"CN-6618" `	With that the door shuts, and a few moments later the black vehicle departs, leaving you and the attendant at the mansion's entrance.`
	"CN-6619" `	The attendant bows deeply. "Please, Captain <last>. If you would follow me." He turns and heads into the building.`
	"CN-6620" `	(Follow the attendant.)`
	"CN-6621" `	Upon entering the mansion you feel your weight shift. It's still a little less than 1 g, but close. There's a young well-dressed woman, the same who you saw in your message, waiting for you inside. The attendant leaves you with her.`
	"CN-6622" `	The woman smiles pleasantly. "We are all so pleased you could make it here. Forgive me for not meeting you outside, but I find the gravity of this world distressing. I am Wynnafrith, the governor's executive assistant, and will be pleased to announce that you are here.`
	"CN-6623" `	Wynnafrith says a few quiet words into an intercom, and a door behind her opens. "The Governor is ready for you."`
	"CN-6624" `	(Enter the room.)`
	"CN-6625" `	You enter a large, richly furnished room. At the center of the room is an imposing desk, with a slightly graying man seated behind it. There is something immediately familiar about his face.`
	"CN-6626" `	"Ah, Captain <last>. At last we can meet face to face, and I can thank you properly." The Governor stands. "You may not remember me, for it has been some years since you last laid eyes on me, and," the governor gestures to himself, "I looked quite different back then."`
	"CN-6627" `	"I was a stowaway on your ship. You found me in a food crate, and you took me here. I'm Timothy Radrickson, Governor Timothy Radrickson now."`
	"CN-6628" `	Timothy sits back down and indicates that you should do the same. "It took me some time. But through some good decisions, and quite a bit of luck, I've been able to claw my way to a level of respectability and wealth. I've really been able to make something of myself."`
	"CN-6629" `	His face opens up into a large grin. "Then again, compared to what you've done in all this time, my successes hardly register. Still, as meager as they may be, I owe it all to you and your kind gesture. Which is why I've invited you here, to thank you and pay you back properly."`
	"CN-6630" `	Timothy taps a display on his desk. "First, I am transferring 125,000 credits to your account to pay you back for the crate of food, the fuel, and the additional expenses of taking care of me on your ship; plus interest, of course."`
	"CN-6631" `	(Accept the money.)`
	"CN-6632" `	(Refuse the money.)`
	"CN-6633" `	You begin to refuse the generous offer, but Timothy holds up a hand to stop you. "I am doing quite well, and this discharges a debt that has been weighing on me. Besides, the money's already been sent!"`
	"CN-6634" `	Timothy pulls out a bottle beneath his desk and two glass cups. "To celebrate our reunion."`
	"CN-6635" `	He pours the brown liquid in the cups and pushes one to you. "Things have gone well for me, and are only going to get better from here on out."`
	"CN-6636" `	He takes a sip and says, "We've just launched our largest freighter fleet to date." He sits back in his desk, relaxed, and gets a dreamy look in his eyes. "When it returns from Wayfarer, the government of Rand will finally have enough credits to make some real changes around here. Give something back to the working man."`
	"CN-6637" `	"Congratulations Timothy. You're really outdone yourself."`
	"CN-6638" `	(Take a sip from my glass.)`
	"CN-6639" `	"Don't forget your humble beginnings, Timothy. The workers here seem to be suffering, while the rich thrive."`
	"CN-6640" `	"You're proof that hard work is all it takes to succeed. I don't know how you can stand living on a world filled with lazy workers all demanding hand outs."`
	"CN-6641" `	His eyes refocus on you. "You'd be proud, <first>. I am going to make a real difference here..."`
	"CN-6642" `	Timothy is suddenly interrupted by an incessant notification coming from his desk. He glowers and says, "Excuse me for a moment, <last>," sits up straight, turns on his ear piece and answers the call.`
	"CN-6643" `	"What?!" He nearly shouts after ten seconds of listening, followed by "How can that be?" and finally, "What about the Navy or the militias, where are they!?" His face goes from red to white as the color drains out of him, and he finishes the call with a few unhappy "uh huhs" before finally hanging up.`
	"CN-6644" `	"Never mind." He rubs his forehead and closes his eyes before saying, "Rand's future is gone. It's just been hijacked by marauders."`
	"CN-6645" `	He stands up and starts pacing around the room. "I'm sorry. We're going to have to cut this reunion short. Our freighter fleet, filled to the brim with all of Rand's mineral wealth, has been taken. To make matters worse, in order to make this shipment happen I had to hire a private outfit from the Deep, and neither the Navy nor the Free Worlds militias are going to intervene on their behalf. Which means this entire world, and myself, are finished."`
	"CN-6646" `	He collapses back in his chair with his head in his hands. "I'm sorry. There will be a car waiting for you at the entrance."`
	"CN-6647" `	"I could help you recover the fleet."`
	"CN-6648" `	(Apologize for his predicament and leave.)`
	"CN-6649" `	(Leave without saying anything.)`
	"CN-6650" `	The doors behind you open back up, and you are led back outside to a waiting vehicle. You ride it in silence through the dust-thick landscape, back to the dirty, shabby spaceport where your ship awaits.`
	"CN-6651" `	Timothy jerks up to look at you, his eyes wide and searching. "Really? I... Rand... we don't have anything left to pay you, and who knows how dangerous those marauders are... but we'll take any help we can get if you're up for it."`
	"CN-6652" `	(Agree to help.)`
	"CN-6653" `	(Back out.)`
	"CN-6654" `	The light drains from his eyes and he nods tiredly. "I understand."`
	"CN-6655" `	Color returns to Timothy's face and he immediately straightens up. "Hroar's Haulers were contracted to deliver our freight to Wayfarer. We lost contact with them in the Peacock system. There was a report from some local merchants who sighted a large group of marauders in Lesath escorting a freighter fleet in merchant colors. They tracked their movements to Shaula."`
	"CN-6656" `	He frowns as he considers something, then says, "If you hurry, you might be able to get there before they've had time to move the goods or deal with their crews... no more than a week at most... but who knows, they're pirates." Timothy hits a few more buttons on his display screen, then he continues, "I've just sent your ship the tracking beacon for our fleet. It should help you find them once you're in Greenrock's atmosphere."`
	"CN-6657" `	"I am sorry I can't offer you more help." He stands up and hits the button opening up the exit door. "But, please, save that fleet."`
	"CN-6658" `Your ship skims Greenrock's choppy atmosphere and your terrestrial navigation computer suddenly hums to life as it picks up the lost freighter fleet's tracking beacon. It locks on to a large encampment situated in a valley a bit under fifty kilometers northeast of the planetary spaceport - close enough to do business, but far enough away to maintain strict security.`
	"CN-6659" `	As you approach the beacon's ping from the safety of the hills around the valley, you survey the base from afar. It clearly appears to be built around a set of underground blast doors, from where the beacon - and presumably the fleet - is located. Your ship also identifies numerous parked pirate vessels inside and outside the base.`
	"CN-6660" `	The pirates haven't realized you're hostile yet, and you have an opportunity to seize the initiative and do a surprise attack. Or, you could get closer and continue surveying the base to see if there's any way in.`
	"CN-6661" `	(Do a surprise attack!)`
	"CN-6662" `	(Get closer.)`
	"CN-6663" `	(Hail the pirates and use diplomacy.)`
	"CN-6664" `	(This is too dangerous. Leave.)`
	"CN-6665" `	Getting as far as you can toward the base without compromising your position, you notice the base is surrounded by an array of laser turrets and ground-to-air missile systems, which makes further approach highly risky. Furthermore, the ships outside the base appear to be highly modified. You don't see any other entrance to the base, however; it looks like you'll have to force the pirates out, one way or another.`
	"CN-6666" `	It still seems as if the pirates don't see you. With a little movement, you could strafe the encampment and take out a fair few of the parked ships if you can avoid the turrets.`
	"CN-6667" `	(Strafe the parked pirate vessels.)`
	"CN-6668" `	Carefully maneuvering into position, your ship flies out of the hills that hid it and lets loose a withering barrage over the parked pirate vessels. You manage to destroy a number of the ships while their shields are down, before the defense turrets force you to fly back up into space as the surviving ships sortie after you.`
	"CN-6669" `	You broadcast a message to the ships parked in the encampment, declaring that you wish them no harm and inviting them to parley over the Rand convoy.`
	"CN-6670" `	Their only response is to launch their entire fleet after you. You're forced back into space to fight them.`
	"CN-6671" `	You shunt your thrusters to full speed and fly into the valley, straight for the largest cluster of parked ships outside the blast doors.`
	"CN-6672" `	That is, until your sensors run hot with a multitude of approaching enemy warnings and missile locks. Without the protection of the hills that were hiding your ship, it looks like the pirates' early warning system detected you before you could get into position to attack. You're forced to turn back as an entire fleet of marauders fire up their engines and chase you into space.`
	"CN-6673" `The sky burns red as detritus from the fierce battle rains down on Greenrock. The destruction of a major pirate gang's fleet has resulted in panic and chaos over the region as rival pirate groups battle it out in the skies to claim the defeated's turf. Although a few ships take pot shots at you as you descend into the atmosphere, everybody is too busy brawling to notice you as you approach the pirates' encampment from where you still register the ping of the beacon.`
	"CN-6674" `	The valley where the encampment is located, however, is surprisingly quiet, though it's similarly littered with the remains of small ships. As you move towards it you notice that the blast doors of the underground base have been opened. What you also notice is that the defense turrets are all still working and are very much trained upon you.`
	"CN-6675" `	(Hail the occupants of the base.)`
	"CN-6676" `	(Approach the base.)`
	"CN-6677" `	"This is Captain <last>, commander of the <ship>," you say. "We have defeated the fleet that occupies this base and demand entry. Disable your turrets or we will fire upon them."`
	"CN-6678" `	You receive a response promptly. "And what makes you think we will let ya' in?"`
	"CN-6679" `	This time, you get a response promptly. "And what makes you think we will let ya' in?"`
	"CN-6680" `	You advance towards the encampment for about five seconds before you receive a hail coming from behind the blast doors. "Hey, hey! What makes you think we'll let ya' in?"`
	"CN-6681" `	"Right of conquest."`
	"CN-6682" `	"Because I defeated your fleet."`
	"CN-6683" `	"Because I'm here to rescue the Rand convoy, and you can't stop me."`
	"CN-6684" `	You hear a hearty laugh from the other end. "What makes you think they're still here?" the voice replies.`
	"CN-6685" `	You hear a hearty laugh from the other end. "Right of conquest? I thought you were here to save us!" the voice replies.`
	"CN-6686" `	You hear a hearty laugh from the other end. "That fleet? Just a trifle. We've got the Sol Home Fleet behind these doors," the voice replies.`
	"CN-6687" `	A moment passes before it says, "We're just pulling your leg, <last>. We can see your tracking beacon reflecting our own, so we know it's you. Come on in." The turrets shortly depower and you gently put your ship down through the blast doors.`
	"CN-6688" `	Inside the bay's walls you can make out the moored and apparently intact freighter fleet. The ships are surrounded by various loaders, but they appear to have been abandoned before they could begin the process of offloading the goods. The pirates must have been too busy going after you.`
	"CN-6689" `	As you exit your ship a woman wearing a captain's hat approaches you and then flashes a reluctant smile at you. "Name's Hrodny. Capt'n Hrodny of Hroar's Haulers. You probably heard Alan on the radio," she says, flicking her eyes to the control room.`
	"CN-6690" `	"Well, thanks for the distraction. Once you got the fleet out of here we overpowered what little detail they kept here and took control of the turrets." She looks around to the blast doors where the depowered turrets once guarded. "Been waitin' for the right moment to move outta this place."`
	"CN-6691" `	Hrodny turns her piercing green eyes back on you. "We got 'em in here easy, but we can't fight past whatever is out there. I'm presuming you're not just a lost mercenary and are in fact our cavalry?"`
	"CN-6692" `	"Don't worry. I can escort your fleet to Wayfarer."`
	"CN-6693" `	"It's your lucky day. Getting you to Wayfarer will be a piece of cake."`
	"CN-6694" `	"I've been sent to get you to Wayfarer, and that's what I will do."`
	"CN-6695" `	"You do your job. I'll do mine."`
	"CN-6696" `	Hrodny grins. "Great. We weren't too keen on stickin' around these parts anyhow."`
	"CN-6697" `	She looks back at her ships, whistles, and points toward the ships. A group of Haulers turn and run toward them, preparing them for takeoff. She then looks back at you. "Ya know, those pirates parked us right in the middle of their treasure trove. It'd be rude not take advantage of their hospitality." You notice the loaders behind Hrodny whirring around and moving all sorts of goods into the ships, while a number of crew are draining the base's deuterium tanks and filling up the ships inside.`
	"CN-6698" `	"Hazard pay," Hrodny says, winking at you. "You head back your ship, and by the time you get there we'll be ready to launch. We'll follow ya out."`
	"CN-6699" `	She gives you a final mock salute and then turns and jogs toward her ships. There's nothing for you to do but head back toward yours.`
	"CN-6700" `The freighter fleet sets down to some minor fanfare; there are likely more than a few middlemen here who would have been hard-pressed by the loss of the fleet's valuable cargo.`
	"CN-6701" `	Not long after landing, Captain Hrodny seeks you out. "Didn't have much time back there for pleasantries, but gotta say I am mighty thankful you showed up when you did."`
	"CN-6702" `	She extends her hand to you.`
	"CN-6703" `	(Shake Hrodny's hand.)`
	"CN-6704" `	(Don't shake her hand.)`
	"CN-6705" `	She shrugs and withdraws her hand. "Different customs I suppose."`
	"CN-6706" `	Hrodny pauses for a moment, then says, "Gotta say you handled yourself well out there. Always good to see a capt'n worth more than the dust on their boots." She gives you an approving nod.`
	"CN-6707" `	Her hand vigorously shakes yours. "Gotta say you handled yourself well out there. Always good to see a capt'n worth more than the dust on their boots." She gives you an approving nod.`
	"CN-6708" `	"I got word from Rand they are more than a little pleased with your heroics. They'd like you to head on over to the spaceport on Rand when you can. Probably have some credits or a photo op or something fancy and tedious waiting for you."`
	"CN-6709" `	She shrugs, and winks, "Anyways, I got plenty of work that needs doing. Take care of yourself, Capt'n."`
	"CN-6710" `	With that she heads back to her freighter fleet.`
	"CN-6711" `Instead of Regina you are met by Timothy's executive secretary, Wynnafrith. She is clearly a little uncomfortable in Rand's low gravity, but is doing her best to push through it.`
	"CN-6712" `	"Captain <last>! You're the talk of the world! The savior of Rand." She gives you an open and earnest smile.`
	"CN-6713" `	"I've been sent by the Governor to drive you straight to his estate. Please come with me."`
	"CN-6714" `	(Go to the Governor's Mansion.)`
	"CN-6715" `	In the evening the passing landscape is too dark to see, so instead you focus on the glittering stars overhead. Eventually your ride slows as you seem to be caught up in traffic near the Governor's mansion. As you approach you pass streets crowded with parked personal vehicles.`
	"CN-6716" `	The mansion is lit up with dozens of flood lights, and brimming with fabulously dressed people. Wynnafrith turns her vehicle over to a valet and opens your door to let you out.`
	"CN-6717" `	She gives you a mischievous grin. "Apologies, Captain <last>. I forgot to mention the Governor was holding a little get-together. Please follow me."`
	"CN-6718" `	(Follow Wynnafrith.)`
	"CN-6719" `	She leads you through an army of valets, waiters, and attendants as you weave in and out of the various rooms and halls. Many of the guests appear to recognize you and offer you earnest congratulations. Eventually you are ushered to the table of honor where Wynnafrith introduces you to a half dozen company bosses, senior executives, political operatives, and the like. You notice Regina here as well, but she is seated at a table in the back, on the fringes of the upper crust of society.`
	"CN-6720" `	Not long after being seated Governor Timothy appears, and after making small talk with many of the gathered illuminaries, sits beside you. "I have something to admit," he says quietly to you.`
	"CN-6721" `	He gives you a sheepish smile and says, "This is a celebration in your honor, Hero of Rand."`
	"CN-6722" `	"Hero of Rand?"`
	"CN-6723" `	"So you lied to me."`
	"CN-6724" `	He shrugs. "I just thought it would be more fun this way. Who doesn't like surprises?"`
	"CN-6725" `	"Without you the entire planet would have defaulted. Our creditors were circling like vultures eager to assume ownership of all our production capabilities, and turn the population into indentured servants. The whole world would have been their debtor's prison."`
	"CN-6726" `	He pauses to consider his words. "I mean, the language they would have used would be different, but that is what it would have amounted to. But you saved us, and more than that, we're now quite a bit more wealthy than we were before."`
	"CN-6727" `	Timothy snatches a glass and holds it up to you and says, "From ruin to riches! The Hero of Rand!"`
	"CN-6728" `	A few others lift their glasses as well. They clink and Timothy then gulps the whole thing down, and after that the group breaks apart into smaller conversations.`
	"CN-6729" `	Eventually, the party settles down and Timothy leaves you to step up to the podium. He launches into a speech highlighting your career. The great changes you have wrought, the battles you have won, the legends of your ship. The crowd eats it all up, many having heard of some, or all of these exploits. But then Timothy takes a more somber note. He talks quietly about the troubles on his old world. On how as a starving, homeless fugitive he had recklessly hidden aboard the first ship he could find. How you had found him, half dead, in an empty crate. And how, instead of tossing him out an airlock, or dropping off at the nearest world, you took him where he asked. How you took care of him, and how through your generosity, you had given him a second chance.`
	"CN-6730" `	Light reflects off the tears that cling to Timothy's eyes as he tells the assembled crowd that, for him, that was your greatest moment, your most heroic action, that nothing you've done, or ever will do, compares to that simple act of mercy. And that this, to him, alone, is what makes you great.`
	"CN-6731" `	From here his story shifts to your selfless offer to help save Rand, even though they could promise no reward, of your stunning victory over Greenrock, and your daring liberation of the fleet on the ground. He ends with you triumphant, and Rand saved.`
	"CN-6732" `	The assembled guests stand, clap and cheer. They look at you, at your seat of honor, and raise their glasses to you. Eventually as the cheers and hoots die down, the Governor declares you a Hero of Rand, and thanks you for your service.`
	"CN-6733" `	(Say a few words.)`
	"CN-6734" `	(Mingle with the crowd.)`
	"CN-6735" `	(Skip the party.)`
	"CN-6736" `	You walk up to the podium, past the governor and turn to address the assembled guests.`
	"CN-6737" `	(Humbly thank them.)`
	"CN-6738" `	(Tell them it is well deserved.)`
	"CN-6739" `	(Dress them down for being capitalist pigs.)`
	"CN-6740" `	You address the crowd. You compliment them on how well dressed they all are, how lavish this mansion is, how wealthy they all appear. They clap, and laugh at your apt observations. But, then you talk about how poor, dirty, and shabby things are outside of this mansion, with its fake gravity, and fake greenery. You declare you want no praise from them, no flattery, and no accolades. There are a million Heroes of Rand, outside these baroque walls, toiling away in dirty, dangerous mines. All for what? So that these company-bosses and fat-cat politicians can pat each other on the back and live in obscene luxury in the middle of a squalid world? You rail, you rant, you break them down, and you dare them to do something about it. Instead of angry shouts, or acidic boos, you are met with condescending indifference. Even the serving staff look bored, as though they've heard it all before. Finally, your speech ends with not with applause, or even angry glares, but with the sounds of numerous muffled conversations. You've been forgotten, and ignored.`
	"CN-6741" `	Before you have time to say more, Timothy and Wynnafrith have whisked you away from the podium. Timothy, clearly embarrassed by your speech, helps you into an unmarked vehicle that takes you away from the party, and back toward the spaceport and your ship.`
	"CN-6742" `	You thank your host, and the assembled notables for their gracious fanfare. You note, however, that you are just one person, and you've done nothing that any one else in your shoes wouldn't have done. The guests clap as you step away from the podium.`
	"CN-6743" `	You launch into a speech about how you alone are special. How most people are cold and empty robots, but that a fire burns inside your breast. That you are the linchpin that the entire galaxy hinges on, and that every human from here to Farpoint owes their future to you. The crowd's excitement wanes and a smattering of lackluster applause punctuates the end of your speech.`
	"CN-6744" `	You excuse yourself from the table and duck into the first empty room you find. You sit in one of the comfortable chairs; you notice a large wooden desk covered in screens and ledgers. You can still hear the muffled sounds of laughter, speeches, and general chatter from behind the walls. You sit for a while in a dark meditative silence.`
	"CN-6745" `	After a while, a gentle knock on the door and Timothy pushes his way into the room.`
	"CN-6746" `	"I see you've found my office, Captain <last>. I'd like to apologize. I was hoping you'd appreciate the party, but, I realize it's not exactly everyone's scene. There's more then a few vipers in that crowd, and there are things I've had to do for them I am not proud of..." He trails off.`
	"CN-6747" `	"But still, I'm glad you're here. Even tucked away in my office. I wanted to let you know that there are credits associated with tonight's prize. You will be given 1 million credits and a daily stipend of 200 credits, as a gift from Rand, and more specifically, from me.`
	"CN-6748" `	With the speeches done, you mingle with the crowd, making small talk with various dignitaries and company-bosses. You even say a few words to Regina. Everyone is pleased to meet you, and a few people ask for your autograph. Finally, Timothy makes his way to you and takes you to a quieter room off to the side.`
	"CN-6749" `	"Captain <last>, I hope you've found the night agreeable. I've noticed you have your fair share of fans here. I also wanted to let you know that there is cash associated with tonight's reward. You will be given 1 million credits and a daily stipend of 200 credits, as a gift from Rand, and more specifically, from me."`
	"CN-6750" `	Timothy pats you on the back. "Just another way for me to thank you for saving me all those years ago, and now my world as well."`
	"CN-6751" `	You nod politely, and your eyes scan the wall of his office. You see pictures of your ship, and you, from various news articles, printed and framed along the walls."`
	"CN-6752" `	"Thanks for inviting me. I've had a great time."`
	"CN-6753" `	"Are you a stalker?"`
	"CN-6754" `	Timothy puts his glass down and holds his hands out pleading. "No, no. It's not like that."`
	"CN-6755" `	He gestures towards the images on the wall. "I had no family, I had no... past. My life, my life started with you. This is my way of celebrating my past. No, don't you worry, I am not infatuated or anything."`
	"CN-6756" `	You realize that it has been almost a decade since you heard from him last.`
	"CN-6757" `	"Oh, it's nothing compared to what you did for me. What you saved me from, and what you did to bring me here. And then how you bailed me and Rand out again." Timothy glances away from you, as if embarrassed all he did tonight wasn't enough.`
	"CN-6758" `	(Keep talking with Timothy.)`
	"CN-6759" `	(Excuse myself and go back to my ship.)`
	"CN-6760" `	You talk with him for hours. About his life on Rand, the hardships of the mines, how he clawed his way out of it. But also about you, the challenges of running a ship, the battles, the close calls, and the joys of triumph.`
	"CN-6761" `	As you talk you come to realize there is a sadness at the edges of Timothy's stories about being governor. His words seem tinged with regret, though he says nothing specifically regretful. You get the feeling he isn't telling you the whole story.`
	"CN-6762" `	As the sun rises your conversation winds to a close. Timothy escorts you back to a waiting vehicle and you say your farewells. The dark vehicle drives off into the bright desert, leaving behind an island of green and warmth.`
	"CN-6763" `	Timothy acquiesces and escorts you back to a waiting vehicle, and you say your farewells. The dark vehicle drives off into the bright desert, leaving behind an island of green and warmth.`
	"CN-6764" `As you stroll through the spaceport, a name blaring on a nearby news screen catches your attention.`
	"CN-6765" `	(Watch the news.)`
	"CN-6766" `	You keep walking. It's probably nothing worth your time.`
	"CN-6767" `	You turn to check out the screen. The talking heads are discussing some sort of huge scandal and the arrest of a prominent governor.`
	"CN-6768" `	"That's right, Ann," the anchor on the screen says. "With 8 counts of tax evasion, racketeering, and various corruption charges, Timothy Radrickson - former Governor of Rand - will likely spend the next 20 years behind bars."`
	"CN-6769" `	"Where he's going there will be no bars, Tom," Ann quips. "They plan to send him to a work detail on Oblivion."`
	"CN-6770" `	Tom gives that sort of news anchor laugh that's neither committal nor haughty. "In that case, forget what I said about 20 years. Anything more than 5 years on Oblivion is a life sentence."`
	"CN-6771" `	Both news anchors laugh, and then segue into a story about highly intelligent ferrets that have learned to sing in German.`
	"CN-6772" `Your ship descends through the beautiful, toxic horizon and lands in the dirty, dismal spaceport outside of the provincial capital, Tukayyid. The clumped together warehouses they liberally call a spaceport are used as a central clearing house by all on-world industries, and workers from every industry filter in and out of this never-ending boom town. In the shadows, and on the fringes, the sick and infirm linger, looking for a handout; the price of progress on such a hostile world.`
	"CN-6773" `	Among the crowd one face draws your attention. A worker, unsupervised, is moving around a trolley of minerals by your ship as you have it refueled. His complexion is sallow, and his skin seems to droop off his bones. His blood red eyes, noticing your attention, languidly rise to look at you. Despite the damage, you realize you recognize him.`
	"CN-6774" `	"Captain <last>," he says, suffering a coughing fit. There's now red specks on his lips.`
	"CN-6775" `	"It's me. Timothy, remember? Boy, it's been a while. I'm a prisoner now. Chain-ganged here. Probably until the end." He spits his words out in short bursts, careful not to start coughing again.`
	"CN-6776" `	"I'm sorry, Timothy."`
	"CN-6777" `	"Shouldn't have broken the law."`
	"CN-6778" `	"I could use your help. Just to buy some things. Might help." His red eyes glance side to side before he says, conspiratorially, "Meet me tonight in the spaceport. Outside the Stephenson warehouse. Stephenson. I'll tell you what I need."`
	"CN-6779" `	With that, he returns to moving the mineral trolley, leaving you to yourself.`
	"CN-6780" `Even after donning a particulate mask, Oblivion's toxic atmosphere is so thick it seems as if you could swallow it; it doesn't help that the air somehow feels even denser at night. The warehouse marked "Stephenson Heavy Industries" turns out to be at the very edge of the spaceport's boundary, and all you see when you get there is a lone box truck parked in the loading bay.`
	"CN-6781" `	(Approach the truck.)`
	"CN-6782" `	(Leave. Tim doesn't deserve another chance.)`
	"CN-6783" `	By the truck you make out the silhouette of a man heaving heavy equipment in the dim light of the loading bay. He turns to look at you as you come closer.`
	"CN-6784" `	"Captain?"`
	"CN-6785" `	"It's me, <last>."`
	"CN-6786" `	(Say nothing, turn away and leave.)`
	"CN-6787" `	Timothy leans against the nearest wall, and for a moment the only noise in the darkness is his ragged breathing. Finally he says, "In a couple of weeks I go south. Far side of the world. I'll last maybe months. Probably less. I need a chance. I need to get out."`
	"CN-6788" `	His voice gets more animated as he speaks and he nearly launches into another coughing fit before catching himself and taking several uneven breaths. "They're watching me. I can't leave with you. But with the right supplies. Right tools. I can make it."`
	"CN-6789" `	His red eyes rimmed with bloody tears look directly into yours. "Please. Don't let me die here. At least.. give me a chance."`
	"CN-6790" `	"Alright. What do you need?"`
	"CN-6791" `	(Refuse to help him.)`
	"CN-6792" `	You shake your head slowly. "I'm sorry, Timothy. But you broke the law, and this is your punishment. My hands are tied. Maybe when you're out we'll reconnect."`
	"CN-6793" `	What little strength he has seems to deflate, a crimson tear winds down his cracked face. "When I'm out?" He almost laughs, "When I'm out!"`
	"CN-6794" `	He turns his face towards the truck, before looking back at you. "Goodbye, old friend."`
	"CN-6795" `	The weak, broken man returns to loading up the heavy equipment, slower than before.`
	"CN-6796" `	Looking sideways first, Timothy takes a piece of yellowed paper from his pocket and hastily writes something down on it before handing it to you. "Have to go off world. Here's a list of what I need. Go to Rand first - address on paper. Norwen mines. Old friend. She will point you in the right direction."`
	"CN-6797" `	He abruptly turns away from you and goes back to loading equipment, but slower now, buying for time.`
	"CN-6798" `	"Eighteen days," he says wearily. "Then I go south. Lost in the maze of rigs." He pauses before saying more quietly, "and then I die." He looks back at you one last time. "Always owe you." His face cracks in one painful looking grin. "Good luck, my good friend."`
	"CN-6799" `	As you walk away from the Stephenson warehouse you take a look at his list. Initially it's various survival items; backpacks, camping equipment and the like. There's also a specialized survival suit, and some heavy duty detoxification medication here as well. More alarmingly, however, are the industrial chemical compounds that would easily create a bomb, not to mention the gun at the bottom.`
	"CN-6800" `	You're not sure exactly what his crimes were, but you seem to recall them being mostly white-collar. Yet, you could potentially be arming a terrorist with these items.`
	"CN-6801" `	(Keep the list.)`
	"CN-6802" `	(Throw away the list.)`
	"CN-6803" `	You toss the crumpled list into the trash and leave Timothy to his fate.`
	"CN-6804" `	You decide to give Timothy another chance. You put the list back into your pocket and walk back to your ship.`
	"CN-6805" `	As you walk away, you hear the sound of a large garage door shuttering, the racket reverberating around the yard, followed shortly by the rumble of a truck's unhealthy engine revving up for a one way trip.`
	"CN-6806" `The Norwen mines are on no current map, and your initial searches for it come up empty. Eventually you're able to find an old news article about a company mining town by the name of Norwen that attempted to unionize, and how the authorities heroically and humanely put down the uprising. The article briefly mentions that the mine was closed down shortly afterward for unrelated reasons. You're able to use the information from the article and the shakily scrawn partial address that Timothy wrote down to get a good idea where to find the mine.`
	"CN-6807" `	As your ship approaches the mine you can't help but notice the burnt out remains of a gutted and abandoned town. A few minutes later your ship rattles down outside the mine's entrance.`
	"CN-6808" `	(Leave my ship.)`
	"CN-6809" `	It's dark and dusty outside. The planet's low gravity makes you feel languid, and the air uncomfortably light in your lungs. The entrance to the mine looms large before you and seems suddenly quite menacing. Perhaps this wasn't the best idea...`
	"CN-6810" `	"Don't move, or we will end you!" comes a shout from within the darkness of the mine. "Identify yourself, now!"`
	"CN-6811" `	"I'm Captain <last>, veteran of the human civil war!"`
	"CN-6812" `	"I'm a friend of Timothy Radrickson!"`
	"CN-6813" `	"I'm the Hero of Rand!"`
	"CN-6814" `	"I'm just a merchant! My name's Captain <last>!"`
	"CN-6815" `	"Mind your own business, I answer to no one!"`
	"CN-6816" `	(Run back to my ship.)`
	"CN-6817" `	Your response is followed by a short moment of stunned silence, a snicker, and then the click of a trigger.`
	"CN-6818" `	There is a brief, almost pleasant, moment of calm as the inevitability of the situation sinks in... unfortunately, that is the last moment of calm you ever experience, as your body is riddled with bullet rounds mere seconds later.`
	"CN-6819" `	There is a brief, low conversation, followed by what sounds like a voice on a radio. Then finally, "If you're who you say you are, how did you first meet Governor Radrickson?"`
	"CN-6820" `	"I ran into him at the Rand spaceport."`
	"CN-6821" `	"He sent me a message that he wanted to meet me."`
	"CN-6822" `	"I found him in an old equipment locker."`
	"CN-6823" `	"He was hiding in a food crate on my ship."`
	"CN-6824" `	You hear someone swear and say, "We gotta move now! Everything we can't carry, burn; they're onto us!" Some commotion ensues and you hear a few individuals run into the cave.`
	"CN-6825" `	The remaining guard hears something on the radio and then says, "No loose ends. Got it."`
	"CN-6826" `	(Run after them into the cave.)`
	"CN-6827" `	You run straight for the cave, hand on pistol and heart racing. Unfortunately for you, instead of the cave you run right into a bullet. The last thing you see is the guard's dirtied face looking over your body before he finishes the job.`
	"CN-6828" `	You turn around and dash back to your ship, and find that a few bullet rounds followed you as well. You quickly take off, expecting ships to come after you; however, none do.`
	"CN-6829" `	Despite not being able to see your potential assailants you can feel an immediate shift in the tension.`
	"CN-6830" `	"Good," one of them says, seemingly more to themselves than to you. "That's real good." You hear a loud sigh and then, "Alright, Hero of Rand, you're good to approach. The boss wants to see you."`
	"CN-6831" `	Dark shapes materialize from the corners of the entrance, and one of them gently ushers you forward further into the oppressive atmosphere of the old mine.`
	"CN-6832" `	(Follow them into the mine.)`
	"CN-6833" `	You walk in darkness over uneven terrain for what seems like hours before seeing the first glimmers of light.`
	"CN-6834" `	The dull fluorescent lights reveal a small group of haggard young men and women moonlighting as soldiers. There is nothing uniform about the costumes they are wearing, and what little equipment they have looks old, broken or cobbled together. Everything stinks, and the people themselves look stoned, miserable or both.`
	"CN-6835" `	Finally your escort stops outside a door built into the cavern walls. "She's just in here. Behave."`
	"CN-6836" `	(Walk inside.)`
	"CN-6837" `	The woman before you is middle-aged and unusually gaunt, with the hollowed out appearance of a person who's lived too long in Rand's frail gravity. She's attractive though, and there is something very familiar about her face. You've met her before...`
	"CN-6838" `	"Captain <last>!" she says with a genuine grin. "I doubt you recognize me, but I was Governor Radrickson's secretary, Wynnafrith. We met years back at your banquet."`
	"CN-6839" `	She glances down at herself as if recognizing her body's transformation from healthy offworlder to Rander waif. "I dare say the world has changed me now that I'm away from the gravity generators.`
	"CN-6840" `	"Although I am no longer a secretary, I am Union-Colonel Wynnafrith, one of the leaders of the Underground Workers Union!" Her eyes sparkle and her words ring with a deadly seriousness.`
	"CN-6841" `	She tilts her head slightly. "But that's enough about me. What possible reason could you have for coming here?" Her face is open and friendly, but she casually rests her hand on her side arm.`
	"CN-6842" `	(Tell her about Timothy.)`
	"CN-6843" `	(Tell her I just wanted to say hi.)`
	"CN-6844" `	(Tell her it is none of her business.)`
	"CN-6845" `	She frowns and aims her gun squarely at your chest. "It's been too long since I've last seen you. And though you were once Governor Radrickson's friend, things have changed quite a bit since then."`
	"CN-6846" `	She gives you a nonchalant shrug. "If that's all you have to say, then I am afraid there is no good reason to let you leave here alive." She favors you with a brief smile. "Operational security, you know how it goes."`
	"CN-6847" `	She switches off the safety.`
	"CN-6848" `	"Wait! Timothy sent me!"`
	"CN-6849" `	"Take your best shot."`
	"CN-6850" `	She does indeed take her best shot, and the sudden hole in your torso proves to be quite terminal.`
	"CN-6851" `	She shakes her head. "Well, why didn't you just say so? What does our Governor ask of us?" She holsters her sidearm.`
	"CN-6852" `	Union-Colonel Wynnafrith's eyes get misty as you tell her about Timothy's plight. She shakes her head a few times and then takes the list from you and carefully scrutinizes it.`
	"CN-6853" `	"Ya know, to us he's still the Governor. Don't believe what the company-bosses and their paid politicians tell you. He was a good man." She wipes her eyes for a moment. "All he was trying to do was improve the conditions for workers here on Rand. He'd come up from the mines and he knew what it was like."`
	"CN-6854" `	Her free hand tightens into a ball. "The big men didn't like that. But what about the profit margins? They tried to bribe him, to offer him anything he wanted, to just leave things well enough alone. To let the exploitation continue." She says the last words through clenched teeth.`
	"CN-6855" `	"Sure, he made some mistakes. No one becomes governor here without getting a little dirt on their hands. But in the end he refused to give into the company-bosses' demands, and throughout it all he was laboring for the common man." Wynnafirth looks up at you. "You were a good friend to him, it's true, but truth be told, while you may have been his hero, he was ours; he was the real Hero of Rand.`
	"CN-6856" `	"And when he wouldn't budge they finally got him on trumped up charges and threw him to Oblivion to disappear and die." She shakes her head. "There was nothing we could do. We're still in a..." she hesitates, "... a rebuilding phase."`
	"CN-6857" `	She reads the list again. "A few weeks, you say? Well, we already thought he was dead, so if there's a chance we save the Governor then we're in.`
	"CN-6858" `	"We have a few left over explosives and detonators from when this mine was active. That should take care of the bomb he was hoping for." She then unholsters her sidearm and hands it to you.`
	"CN-6859" `	(Take it.)`
	"CN-6860" `	"And this should take care of his need for a gun. As for the other items on there..." She turns to a torn and faded star chart taped on the rocky cavern wall.`
	"CN-6861" `	Grabbing a small stick leaning against the wall, she points to Rastaban. "Dancer would be the best world to find a survival suit rated for Oblivion's toxic environment. As for medication..." She looks over the chart for a moment, then points to Dabih. "Your best bet will be New Britain. One of the few worlds in the Belt that can produce complex pharmaceuticals."`
	"CN-6862" `	The stick points at Shaula next. "The best place for a fake ID would be the 'independent' world of Greenrock." She taps her chin before continuing, "It would be tight though getting to all three of these worlds and back to the governor in time. Any of these worlds may also have the other equipment you need, but the quality likely wouldn't be as good."`
	"CN-6863" `	She turns back to you. "I am sorry we couldn't be more help, but hopefully it's enough."`
	"CN-6864" `	After putting the pointing stick back in its place, Wynnafrith steps through the door, indicating for you to follow her.`
	"CN-6865" `	Once again in the larger cavern she turns and points at the guard. "Grab our bomb and accompany Captain <last> with it back to their ship."`
	"CN-6866" `	The guard frowns. "But it's our only one..."`
	"CN-6867" `	"Now!" She cuts him off, and watches as he sullenly slumps away.`
	"CN-6868" `	Without looking your way she continues, "It was a pleasure to see you again, Captain <last>, but it's time you were leaving. The governor needs you, and my own glorious revolution needs some attention."`
	"CN-6869" `	You leave the dilapidated mines with a bomb, a pistol, and a plan.`
	"CN-6870" `With a little effort you're able to navigate New Britain's labyrinthian ziggurat masquerading as a spaceport. The lower levels are dedicated to a bustling trade sector where merchants, traders, and producers from all over the Dirt Belt haggle to sell their raw materials, and purchase complex equipment and refined products.`
	"CN-6871" `	(Find the detoxification medicine.)`
	"CN-6872" `	(Haggle with the medicine salesman again.)`
	"CN-6873" `	(Look for the survival suit.)`
	"CN-6874" `	(Return to the shop to buy the survival suit.)`
	"CN-6875" `	(Find someone that can procure a fake ID for me.)`
	"CN-6876" `	(Leave the trade sector.)`
	"CN-6877" `	You make your way to the pharmaceutical wing, through crowds of representatives from large conglomerates in the process of wrangling with representatives from various worlds, all needing exotic medicine for their innumerable plagues, blights, pandemics, and the like. There's a booth with a slick salesman selling expensive drugs promising to reverse and protect from the effect of toxic air and radiation, and it just so happens that Oblivion is their demonstration planet.`
	"CN-6878" `	"There's no need to fear Oblivion's deleterious effects so long as you take one of these a day!" the salesman says brightly. "Why, you could walk among your condemned workers unmasked, and demonstrate your superior executive prowess!"`
	"CN-6879" `	You listen on to the salesman, who reckons he can cut you in on a special deal for 140,000 credits.`
	"CN-6880" `	(Purchase the medicine for Tim.)`
	"CN-6881" `	(Haggle for a lower price.)`
	"CN-6882" `	(Pass.)`
	"CN-6883" `	That price is too steep. You return to the central atrium of the trade sector to consider your options.`
	"CN-6884" `The salesman's eyes narrow and his face suddenly looks vaguely reptilian. "I'm already giving you the best price. The literal shirt off my back!"`
	"CN-6885" `	(Offer 60,000 for the meds.)`
	"CN-6886" `	(Offer 120,000 for the meds.)`
	"CN-6887" `	(Agree to pay 140,000 for the meds.)`
	"CN-6888" `	The drug salesman's eyes flash with hostility before he breaks out in an angry laugh. "Who do you think you are? What do you think, this is a charity? I already have a buyer lined up for more than twice that!"`
	"CN-6889" `	He begins packing up his equipment. "I'm charging you full price, 140,000 or nothing. Last chance."`
	"CN-6890" `	That price is too high; you'll have to see if you can purchase a less potent and cheaper drug elsewhere. You return to the central atrium of the trade sector to consider your other options.`
	"CN-6891" `	The salesman glowers, but nods his head slightly. "Fine! 120,000 credits it is. My family will starve, but at least you'll get your precious drugs." He begins packing them up for you.`
	"CN-6892" `	You decide to go back the pharmaceutical wing to reconsider the deal.`
	"CN-6893" `	"Here's the captain again!" says the salesman, as if he'd known you for years. He leans in uncomfortably close to you and says, "I can tell you're a discerning customer, so here's what I will let these go for: 120,000 credits. That's almost wholesale price! I'm barely making a cent, but I really need to unload all these drugs."`
	"CN-6894" `	He favors you with an unnaturally white, toothy grin.`
	"CN-6895" `	(Purchase the discounted medicine for Tim.)`
	"CN-6896" `	(Haggle for an even lower price.)`
	"CN-6897" `	Again, the medicine just costs too much; Tim will have to survive with something less potent.`
	"CN-6898" `	The salesman's eyes bulge, and his smooth face is suddenly crisscrossed with unattractive wrinkles. "Fine. I have another buyer anyways," he half-growls at you. He begins packing up his stall, muttering and shaking his head to himself as he does so.`
	"CN-6899" `	You return to the central atrium of the trade sector to consider your other options.`
	"CN-6900" `	The drug salesman's eyes flash with hostility before he breaks out in an angry laugh. "Who do you think you are? What do you think, this is a charity? I already have a buyer lined up for more than twice what I've offered you!"`
	"CN-6901" `	He begins packing up his equipment. "For wasting my time I'm charging you full price, 140,000 or nothing. Last chance."`
	"CN-6902" `	(Purchase the medcine for Tim.)`
	"CN-6903" `	That price is still too expensive. You'll have to see if you can purchase a less potent and cheaper drug elsewhere.`
	"CN-6904" `	After closing the deal, you hand over a credit chip for <payment> to the salesman and he gives you the medicine, boxed and in a bag. You hope it'll save Timothy.`
	"CN-6905" `	It doesn't take long for you to find stores stocked with flashy, expensive clothes brands. The ones catering to the wealthy, adventurous types. Hobbyists with something to prove. The gear here is attractive, mass produced, and beneath the lifestyle veneer they give off, somewhat cheap. They might not be industrial grade, but maybe they'll be good enough for Timothy. Maybe.`
	"CN-6906" `	There's a store named "Explorer's Element" not far from the central atrium which looks promising. The advertised price for the most heavy-duty survival suit they stock is only 99,999 credits, and there are numerous suits on the rack.`
	"CN-6907" `	(Get the survival suit for Tim.)`
	"CN-6908" `	The suit's value is probably a good indicator of its usefulness, and you pass up on the option to buy it. You return to the central atrium of the trade sector to consider your options.`
	"CN-6909" `	You return to the store and locate the rack filled with the hobbyist survival suits. The price is still 99,999 credits.`
	"CN-6910" `	You just can't pull the trigger. You return to the terminal area to consider your other options.`
	"CN-6911" `	The sales associate is delighted to remove the tags and wrap up your brand new survival suit. He tells you about how his cousin used one just last month to visit a mildly chilly beach a few hours north of the spaceport.`
	"CN-6912" `	You pay the <payment>, and he hands you the bag.`
	"CN-6913" `	The trade sector has all manner of ID services and consultants, but you find none of the respectable ones are willing to talk to you after you explain the ID has to be prepared "in absentia," and the unrespectable ones appear to be lacking here given the presence of the spaceport gendarme at every corner. Frustrated, you decide to take a walk outside the spaceport proper.`
	"CN-6914" `	(Give up and go get something else.)`
	"CN-6915" `	(Keep walking about.)`
	"CN-6916" `	You eventually reach a little forested garden area with a few benches, by one of the parking lots that serve the spaceport. The suns of Dabih are out in full force today, and you're glad to be in the shade.`
	"CN-6917" `	As you recover from the heat you notice that, sitting over in the parking lot, there's a few teenagers chatting amongst themselves. The sort that look like they'd know where to get a false ID if they needed one. Perhaps they could give you some pointers.`
	"CN-6918" `	(Approach the teenagers for help about the ID.)`
	"CN-6919" `	The teenagers, two of them boys and one a girl, grin at you like fresh meat as you near them.`
	"CN-6920" `	The guy in the middle says, "What'dya need, boss? Wanna get high? Wanna get low? Wanna get out?" Apparently this group is used to working with frustrated castouts from the overly legal spaceport emporium.`
	"CN-6921" `	(Ask them about where I could get a fake ID.)`
	"CN-6922" `	(Politely decline and head back to my ship.)`
	"CN-6923" `	(Threaten to call the police.)`
	"CN-6924" `	They back away from you and frown. The middle one lowers his hand to some concealed weapon, but stops himself when he notices your own holstered gun.`
	"CN-6925" `	The girl next to him mutters, "Ain't worth it. Let's roll." The kids promptly walk off, leaving you alone in the park.`
	"CN-6926" `	(Head back to the spaceport.)`
	"CN-6927" `	The three of them look at each other and then give you a carnivorous grin.`
	"CN-6928" `	"Sure thing," he smirks. "Easy as rain. It'll cost ya 'bout 20,000 cred." They look at you expectantly.`
	"CN-6929" `	(Give them the credits.)`
	"CN-6930" `	"Wait! Show me how you're going to do it first."`
	"CN-6931" `	(Turn them down.)`
	"CN-6932" `	He sighs. "Fine. I know a guy in the city, he snags us fake IDs all the time, gets us into bars, clubs, all sorts. All we need is how ya want this false guy to look, we'll take it to him and get the ID, and you'll be sweet.`
	"CN-6933" `	"So, ya gonna take it?"`
	"CN-6934" `	Collectively they frown. "Your loss," the middle guy says, before leaving you alone to return to the spaceport.`
	"CN-6935" `	"Alrighty then, it's a done deal," he says, stashing the credit chip away. He then pulls out a datapad and asks you a few questions about what to put on the ID. You try to answer as best you can in regards to Timothy (and change a few of the more obviously incriminating details). They say to meet you here in a couple hours once they've got the ID sorted in the city.`
	"CN-6936" `	Two and a half hours pass as you wait for the teens in the garden, but there's no sign of them yet. You wonder if you've just given 20,000 credits away for nothing.`
	"CN-6937" `	Another thirty minutes pass, but just as you're about to leave the three teens show themselves again, ID in hand.`
	"CN-6938" `	"We thought you're gonna bail out on us for bein' late. Thankfully you got the sense not to. And now ya get the goods in exchange." The middle kid hands you the ID. "Good dealin' with ya," he says as they walk off.`
	"CN-6939" `	As you go back to the spaceport, you take a look at the ID for the first time.`
	"CN-6940" `	Whoever made this clearly wasn't a professional. It looks like they've somehow botched the bar code, given the smear on the print, and the duplication of the emblem of the planetary authority of New Britain on the back is rather dodgy. But unless you can find a better alternative, it'll have to do.`
	"CN-6941" `	You sigh, having learnt a lesson that teenagers in parking lots probably aren't the most trustworthy of people. Back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-6942" `	After a long day of walking about the New British spaceport and wading through the crowds of hustlers and travellers, you return to the relatively calmer terminal area at the top of the pyramid.`
	"CN-6943" `Your ship shakes as it descends into Dancer's mad weather. Lightning crackles beyond your sturdy bulkheads and a panoply of colorful clouds rushes past as you boost down into in the dull overcast light of a subdued day on Dancer.`
	"CN-6944" `	Around the quiet spaceport there's a smattering of low reinforced buildings linked together by weather-worn trails dug into the ground with protective earth on either side. You see one leading to a spacious, if squat, clearing house.`
	"CN-6945" `	(Enter the clearing house.)`
	"CN-6946" `	There is an eclectic assortment of gear, goods, supplies and equipment here, some new, some used to the point of ruin. Unsurprisingly, given the primary industry of this world, much of it is scientific.`
	"CN-6947" `	A middle aged woman with deep windburned scars and a striking shock of white between her otherwise dark hair greets you as you come in. "Anything worth having on Dancer can be found here. Just take a look around and let Bertha know if you find anything to your liking."`
	"CN-6948" `	(Look at the survival suits.)`
	"CN-6949" `	(Look at the survival suits again.)`
	"CN-6950" `	(Check the medicine shelves.)`
	"CN-6951" `	(Return to the medicine shelves.)`
	"CN-6952" `	(Rummage around for old IDs.)`
	"CN-6953" `	(Go back to where I found the ID.)`
	"CN-6954" `	(Leave the clearing house.)`
	"CN-6955" `	There are a handful of survival suits on display here. These are durable, hand-crafted suits carefully checked and rated to ensure the highest chance of survival against the fierce uncaring winds of Dancer.`
	"CN-6956" `	Bertha notices your attention and walks up to you. "Going anywhere overland on Dancer without one of these beauties is a death wish."`
	"CN-6957" `	She winks at you, as if she knows something you don't. "Worry not though, hun. We only sell the highest rated and best-tested suits here. I won't have anyone's death on my conscience - 'sides, it's bad for business."`
	"CN-6958" `	She pinches some of the dense microwoven fabric of the nearest suit. "It's not cheap, but neither is your life. I'll sell ya one of these for 300,000 credits."`
	"CN-6959" `	(Purchase a survival suit for Tim.)`
	"CN-6960" `	(Haggle to try and lower the price.)`
	"CN-6961" `	You decide that 300,000 credits is way too much. The woman shrugs and steps away as you turn your attention back to the rest of the store.`
	"CN-6962" `	Bertha gives you a sad smile and shakes her head slowly. "No room here for haggling, hun. These are the best of the best and they are worth every red cent. I am sure you can find bottom bin ones elsewhere, but here you pay for quality."`
	"CN-6963" `	She folds her arms. "Now, it's 300,000 credits or nothing."`
	"CN-6964" `	(Purchase the survival suit for Tim.)`
	"CN-6965" `	Bertha sighs and then shrugs, and leaves you alone to continue browsing through her clearing house.`
	"CN-6966" `	You loop back to where the well-crafted survival suits hang. The price is still 300,000 credits.`
	"CN-6967" `	(Go back to browsing.)`
	"CN-6968" `	Not ready to make a purchase, you return to perusing the store.`
	"CN-6969" `	Bertha is happy to ring you up, and gives you the carefully packaged and sealed survival suit for <payment>.`
	"CN-6970" `	There's numerous shelves filled with all kinds of drugs, and it takes you a few minutes to find the detoxification medicine. By then Bertha is at your side.`
	"CN-6971" `	"Foul winds are known to kick up toxic dust in the atmosphere, and if you plan on staying here long you're likely going to need to take a few of these." She looks at you curiously, and then adds, "However, you may find them less useful on other worlds."`
	"CN-6972" `	"Still, if you think you could use them I'd sell them to you for 10,000 credits," she adds helpfully.`
	"CN-6973" `	(Buy Dancer's medicine for Tim.)`
	"CN-6974" `	Bertha nods. "You have the windless look of a tourist. Best to leave these for those who are going to spend some real time on Dancer."`
	"CN-6975" `	The shelves of medication are just where you left them. You can grab a kit of Dancer detoxification drugs for 10,000 credits.`
	"CN-6976" `	You leave the drugs where they are and return to looking through the clearance house.`
	"CN-6977" `	Bertha packages the drugs for you and looks at with mild concern. "Remember. These really are only rated for Dancer. I do not advise using them offworld."`
	"CN-6978" `	She takes your <payment>, and hands you the drugs.`
	"CN-6979" `	Toward the back you find various bins that are filled with what look like the unsorted personal belongings of scientists.`
	"CN-6980" `	Bertha sees you in the back but doesn't join you. Instead she just hollers, "Scientists are always coming and going and sometimes leave a lot behind. I'd be as pleased as a wind vane on a calm day if you took any of that off my hands. Whatever you find I'll give to ya for 1,000 credits."`
	"CN-6981" `	You sift through the items - which are mostly clothes and old lab coats - before coming across a scientist's ID card. The name reads 'Skounce Yarling' and the picture, to your surprise, looks a little like Timothy's.`
	"CN-6982" `	(Buy the old ID.)`
	"CN-6983" `	The old ID might work, but it would also be quite a risk. You leave it where you found it and go back to wandering around the store.`
	"CN-6984" `	You return to the bin with Skounce Yarling's ID sitting on the top of his forlorn refuse.`
	"CN-6985" `	(Buy the ID for Tim.)`
	"CN-6986" `	You let sleeping IDs lie, and return to the rest of the store.`
	"CN-6987" `	Bertha favors you with a mischievous grin and combs her black hair behind her ears. "I must admit, I have a thing for danger." Her eyes sparkle and her voice is a little huskier than before as she says, "I'm not sure whatchya need this for, and I certainly don't want you to tell me. But I hope you pull it off."`
	"CN-6988" `	She takes your <payment> and hands you the old ID, her eyes lingering on you.`
	"CN-6989" `	Bertha gives you a friendly nod as you make your way back outside into Dancer's foreboding weather, and the rest of the spaceport.`
	"CN-6990" `You feel the pressure of many unseen eyes watching you as you leave the spaceport and enter into the sprawling stalls of Greenrock's rowdy emporium, where everything and everyone is for sale.`
	"CN-6991" `	Greenrock looks a little more civil than when you were racing around saving captured freighter fleets, but only just a little. There is a wildness here and violence simmers just beneath the surface of every interaction. Luckily, no one seems to remember or care about the fleet you destroyed.`
	"CN-6992" `	The civic infrastructure leaves something to be desired; you can pretty much taste the city's squalid sewer in the air. While trying to get a sense of the area, you weave past various hucksters all trying to get your attention for whatever or whoever they're selling.`
	"CN-6993" `	Finally you reach the center of the emporium and discover a crudely drawn map of the spaceport. It's not much, but at least it tells you where you can find what you're looking for.`
	"CN-6994" `	(Find someone that can produce a fake ID for me.)`
	"CN-6995" `	(Go back to Ivaldur's forging stall for the fake ID.)`
	"CN-6996" `	(Look for a survival suit.)`
	"CN-6997" `	(Go back to the drug dealer to get the detoxification medicine.)`
	"CN-6998" `	(Leave the emporium.)`
	"CN-6999" `	There's more than a half dozen stalls all advertising their high skills and production value when it comes to the art of crafting fake IDs. Most the stalls and their employees have a garish, sloppy, and boastful manner, but one with a more professional and constrained feel attracts your attention; it's run by an older gentleman who has the look of a respectable watchmaker.`
	"CN-7000" `	He nods at you politely as you approach. "Good day to you. I am Ivaldur the Forger, and what can I do for you?"`
	"CN-7001" `	(Ask about producing a fake ID.)`
	"CN-7002" `	For whatever reason you are not interested in doing business with Ivaldur the Forger, and promptly head back out into the emporium.`
	"CN-7003" `	The old man smiles at you good-naturedly. "Simple enough request. I can provide you with an ID, and a complex matching background that will pass all but the most exhaustive of checks."`
	"CN-7004" `	He gives off an aura of quiet confidence as he speaks. "My service is thorough and, as you'll find, quite unmatched. Unless your friend is someone being hunted by Navy Intelligence, he will be able to seamlessly integrate into life on any human world."`
	"CN-7005" `	He pauses as if considering something, and then adds, "If he is also a war criminal on the run from someone like, I don't know, Deep Security or Republic Intelligence... I could also come up with something, but that would be a premium service I doubt you need at the moment."`
	"CN-7006" `	Ivaldur adjusts his spectacles thoughtfully. "The going rate for my basic service is 350,000 credits."`
	"CN-7007" `	He looks at you expectantly and waits.`
	"CN-7008" `	(Pay 350,000 credits for a fake ID and history for Tim.)`
	"CN-7009" `	He simply nods and gives you a knowing look. "I acknowledge the fee seems high, but rest assured the service I provide is well worth it.`
	"CN-7010" `	"I'll be here if you change your mind."`
	"CN-7011" `	Your return to Ivaldur the Forger's stall, and the old man gives you a curt nod as you approach. "Back so soon? I hope you have made your decision."`
	"CN-7012" `	Without speaking you again leave Ivaldur's stall.`
	"CN-7013" `	Ivaldur's eyes light up and he immediately gets to work. From his panel he backdoors his way into various databases, diving into the code with an obvious alacrity and unbridled joy.`
	"CN-7014" `	Whole histories, lives, records and attachments burst into existence in a dozen corners of official networks and reports. It becomes apparent that he is not really creating a fake ID; the ID he creates is real. It is sanctioned, stamped, and endorsed by multiple governing bodies, uploaded to and referenced by institutional records, and given the appropriate checks and markers.`
	"CN-7015" `	In fact, what Ivaldur has done is create a fake person, and this is that person's real ID.`
	"CN-7016" `	When he finishes he says nothing and instead basks in a job well done. Finally, he turns to you for payment. <payment> is transferred into his account, and he hands you Tim's brand new ID card.`
	"CN-7017" `	"It was a pleasure," he says in a satisfied voice, and bids you well.`
	"CN-7018" `	You find a large stall boasting all the survival equipment an enterprising pirate could ever need. Inside there's various used gear, some more used than others, and only a few well weathered survival suits.`
	"CN-7019" `	The proprietor appears out of nowhere and immediately begins flogging his goods to you. "Ah! Yes, with any of these you can survive the harshest of climates!"`
	"CN-7020" `	He takes one suit off the rack and begins, "Notice the intricate mesh weave on this state of the art-" the suit comes apart at its seams in his hands. The proprietor frowns, but then quickly tosses it to the side.`
	"CN-7021" `	"A, uh, defunct specimen. Happens from time to time. Rest assured I never would have sold it to you." He looks at you unconvincingly.`
	"CN-7022" `	He pulls another suit down which, to his obvious relief, doesn't simply fall apart in his hands.`
	"CN-7023" `	"Now as I was saying, top of the line mesh weaves. Great comfort and breathability. For tough spots..."`
	"CN-7024" `	You look carefully at the suit as the proprietor's words drift uselessly out of his mouth. It has patches on top of patches, and its seals look worn and corroded. It looks like a death trap.`
	"CN-7025" `	"...and look just how clean it looks inside." The proprietor opens up one the seals, revealing quite a bit of dried blood staining its insides. He quickly closes the seal and wipes some sweat from his brow.`
	"CN-7026" `	"Perfectly normal to find in a suit. Totally unrelated to its operation. You know, pirates... just bleed a lot in general. Part of the lifestyle and all that."`
	"CN-7027" `	He looks at you with earnest, bulging eyes. "So what do you think? I'd be willing to sell this baby to you for 400,000 credits."`
	"CN-7028" `	(Purchase the patched survival suit for Tim.)`
	"CN-7029" `	That death trap might hasten Tim's demise, not guard against it. You leave the sweating proprietor behind and head back into the emporium at large.`
	"CN-7030" `	The proprietor's eyes dart back and forth, and then he nods vigorously.`
	"CN-7031" `	"Of course. Of course. Given its... condition. It only makes sense that a discerning privateer such as yourself get a discount."`
	"CN-7032" `	"But, uh, if anyone asks about where you got this suit from. Given the obscene value you're getting from me, do me the favor of not disclosing where you got it. I wouldn't want anyone thinking they could get a deal like this."`
	"CN-7033" `	He gives a nervous yet earnest smile.`
	"CN-7034" `	(Offer 20,000 for the suit.)`
	"CN-7035" `	(Offer 100,000 for the suit.)`
	"CN-7036" `	(Offer 250,000 for the suit.)`
	"CN-7037" `	You return to the clothing stall, where the proprietor immediately hounds you again for the suit. The suit you were shown before looks just as patched, worn and corroded as before. The few other options next to it are even worse.`
	"CN-7038" `	The proprietor reminds you the price is still 400,000 credits for this 'lightly used' and 'field tested' state of the art survival suit.`
	"CN-7039" `	The proprietor quickly rings you up as if worried you'll change your mind at any moment, and gleefully takes your <payment>.`
	"CN-7040" `	"Safe travels, privateer," he says as you leave his stall.`
	"CN-7041" `	There are many stalls loudly advertising all kinds of illegal drugs, and it takes some work to sift through them until you come across one selling legal drugs as well. The man running it is sallow and pock-marked, but his eyes are keen. He almost hisses as he greets you.`
	"CN-7042" `	"Whatever you need, wherever you're going, I have you covered."`
	"CN-7043" `	(Ask about detoxification medicine for Oblivion.)`
	"CN-7044" `	This is not the place for you. You take your leave and return to the emporium at large.`
	"CN-7045" `	The drug dealer flashes you with his yellow teeth and unnerving smile. "For every kind of toxic environment under any sun." He jolts towards his little wall of drawers, pulling out one labeled "Oblivion detoxifiers." From the drawer he picks a bottle up, checking its label.`
	"CN-7046" `	"It says it expired a few years ago, but that's just so the corpos can squeeze the common man, ya know? Stuff's still good." He shrugs.`
	"CN-7047" `	"So what'dya say? It'll cost'ya a cool 50,000 credits. But trust me, that's way cheaper than what you'll find elsewhere."`
	"CN-7048" `	(Buy the expired detoxification medicine for Tim.)`
	"CN-7049" `	The drug-dealer says as you go away, "You won't find a better deal than this. I'll be here if you change your mind."`
	"CN-7050" `	The drug-dealer's knowing smile is almost a sneer as you return to his stall. He waits to see if you're ready to buy something.`
	"CN-7051" `	You leave the drug-dealer behind and head back into the emporium.`
	"CN-7052" `	"Trust me, it's still good," the drug-dealer says as he takes your <payment>. He hands you the drugs with a smirk.`
	"CN-7053" `	It's never wise to linger in a place like this, especially aimlessly. With your business concluded you leave Greenrock's stalls behind.`
	"CN-7054" `Your ship touches down beneath Oblivion's toxic ammonia-blue sky. Night or day, there is a constant flurry of workers loading, unloading, building, and expanding the ever growing boom-town of Tukayyid. You unload all of Timothy's gear onto a dolly and push it out into the busy street.`
	"CN-7055" `	Your presence goes unnoticed among the general ruckus and you're able to slip into the off-loading warehouses unseen. You find Timothy there, leaning over a pile of hose hookups, breathing heavily. His blood-red eyes rise to meet yours, and despite their milky gloss, a glimmer of hope burns within them.`
	"CN-7056" `	"You did it?" His words more strained than the last time you spoke. "You got the gear?"`
	"CN-7057" `	He looks down at your dolly expectantly.`
	"CN-7058" `	"It's all here."`
	"CN-7059" `	"Of course I did."`
	"CN-7060" `	"Yep, but you owe me big."`
	"CN-7061" `	He nearly drops to his knees and starts sorting through the gear. He takes heart when you tell him about Wynnafirth's gun and bomb, and how highly she still thinks of him.`
	"CN-7062" `	"Good secretary. Better friend." He wheezes as he checks out the rest of your gear.`
	"CN-7063" `	As he inspects the suit, drugs, and ID you can see his demeanor shift. He seems to deflate a little.`
	"CN-7064" `	Finally, he straightens back up. "You did the best you could. I'm sure." He eyes the gear wearily. "At least it's a chance."`
	"CN-7065" `	As he inspects the suit, drugs, and ID you he nods to himself satisfactorily.`
	"CN-7066" `	Finally, he straightens back up. "It'll do," he says as he eyes the gear. "It'll do."`
	"CN-7067" `	As he inspects the suit, drugs, and ID you can see his demeanor shift. He looks less weak, less sickly, and more confident.`
	"CN-7068" `	Finally, he straightens back up. "It's perfect." He eyes the gear with awe and shakes his head. "Don't know how you did it. But with this I can't fail."`
	"CN-7069" `	Timothy turns from you and uses the dolly to load the gear into one of the trucks in the warehouse. Once done he turns back to you, his eyes wide and rimmed with bloody tears. "Always at my lowest." He swallows a cough, and then continues. "It's you who saves me. When I am at my lowest. It's you."`
	"CN-7070" `	Timothy looks like he wants to hug you, but he just nods. He hits a button on the wall and the garage door opens, exposing the warehouse to the night air.`
	"CN-7071" `	"Captain," he says in way of a farewell, and then he climbs aboard the truck and drives off.`
	"CN-7072" `A spaceport is a symphony of smells, sounds, and images in constant motion. Somewhere in the din, a news report is playing, and a familiar name leaps out at you. Your attention piqued, you turn to watch.`
	"CN-7073" `	"News out of Oblivion today. A minor explosion has claimed the life of Timothy Radrickson, former disgraced Governor of Rand. Sentenced to prison-labor on Oblivion, a hard but fair justice for a man who..."`
	"CN-7074" `	The news broadcast continues to blare, but you aren't able to follow any more than that.`
	"CN-7075" `A group of monks passes you by in the spaceport, and one stops to look at you curiously.`
	"CN-7076" `	"Are you Captain <last>?" he asks.`
	"CN-7077" `	"None of your business."`
	"CN-7078" `	"Of course," the monk says. He drops his head and rejoins his brothers.`
	"CN-7079" `	The monk lowers his head in a sign of respect. "Although we live in the mountains and interact rarely with outsiders, we have heard much of your exploits. You are an agent of change, and worthy of consideration."`
	"CN-7080" `	"I thank you for giving us much to ponder on. I also have one small request; there is one within our monastery who is a great admirer of yours. It would mean much if you would be willing to meet him."`
	"CN-7081" `	"I'd be honored to meet him."`
	"CN-7082" `	"Why not. I got nothing to better to do."`
	"CN-7083" `	"I don't have time for fans."`
	"CN-7084" `	"Of course," the monk says, "you are a busy person." He returns to his brothers.`
	"CN-7085" `	The monk beams. "Wonderful. It'll be a bit of a hike, but the views are worth it."`
	"CN-7086" `	He leads you into the mountains beyond the spaceport. You travel up various narrow passes and steep cliff sides. It's a difficult trail, but the scenery is remarkable. Your views are filled with broken mountains, jagged rocks, vibrant green life, and distant valleys.`
	"CN-7087" `	After several arduous hours, you clear a peak, and discover a vast stone building waiting for you. "We have arrived," the guide says almost anticlimactically. Perhaps the fact he lives here makes it less grand to him than it ought to be.`
	"CN-7088" `	Your guide leaves you outside the entrance, and disappears within for a few minutes before returning with another monk.`
	"CN-7089" `	The new monk looks at you with an open, serene expression, that quickly breaks into a wide grin. Although much about his face has changed, whether from wear or surgery, you recognize that grin.`
	"CN-7090" `	"Timothy!"`
	"CN-7091" `	"Oh, it's you."`
	"CN-7092" `	Timothy Radrickson, former prison-worker on Oblivion, Governor of Rand, and stowaway of your ship, hugs you.`
	"CN-7093" `	"Captain <last>. I always hoped I would see you again. Given my tenuous legal situation, I can't leave here, and I can't send any messages." He steps back to look at you.`
	"CN-7094" `	"The years have been kind to you, Captain; you hardly look any different from when we first met! Perhaps I should have invested in ship life, instead of staying terrestrial!" He laughs at his own joke, but only modestly.`
	"CN-7095" `	"It was difficult for me to speak when last we met on Oblivion, but you're my oldest and best friend. At my lowest points you were always there for me. I just wanted to thank you for that."`
	"CN-7096" `	You spend the day chatting with Timothy, before it's time to leave.`
	"CN-7097" `	"Thank you for coming here. I wish I had something to give you, but I own nothing anymore, even though I owe you everything. Take care out there, and I'll do my best to keep out of trouble in here."`
	"CN-7098" `	(Offer to transfer the Hero of Rand award and stipend to Timothy.)`
	"CN-7099" `	(Shake his hand and say goodbye.)`
	"CN-7100" `	(Give him a hug and say goodbye.)`
	"CN-7101" `	You lean in and give him a warm, earnest bear hug. He wraps his arms around you and squeezes you back. When he finally breaks free, you see his eyes are blurry with tears. He nods to you once, and then walks back into the monastery. You begin your slow descent down the mountain, and back to civilization.`
	"CN-7102" `	You shake his hand; he swallows and clears his throat as he tries to keep himself from crying, nods to you one last time, and then walks back into the monastery. You begin your slow descent down the mountain, and back to civilization.`
	"CN-7103" `	Timothy's eyes go wide. "No, you couldn't. It's yours. You've given me too much already."`
	"CN-7104" `	(Tell him about what Wynnafrith said, and how he is the real Hero of Rand.)`
	"CN-7105" `	(Tell him I don't need the money, but he does.)`
	"CN-7106" `	(Agree with him and rescind my offer.)`
	"CN-7107" `	As you speak Timothy shakes his head slowly, tears streaming down his face. Finally, as you finish, he wraps his arms around you in an earnest, heartfelt hug.`
	"CN-7108" `	He tries to speak, but his voice fails him. Instead he just shakes his teary-eyed head at you and gives you a deep solemn bow.`
	"CN-7109" `	Timothy stays to watch as you begin your slow descent down the mountain, and back to civilization.`
	"CN-7110" `	The monk lowers his head in a sign of respect. "Although we spend most our time mediating and healing the sick, we have heard much of your exploits. You are an agent of change, and worthy of consideration."`
	"CN-7111" `	"I thank you for giving us much to ponder on. I also have one small request; there is one within our hospital who is a great admirer of yours. It would mean much if you would be willing to meet him."`
	"CN-7112" `	"Why not. I've got nothing to better to do."`
	"CN-7113" `	The monk beams. "Wonderful. It's not far from here."`
	"CN-7114" `	You take the spaceport train with him to a nearby hospital, beneath the impressive jungled mountains of New Tibet. In contrast with the other worlds of the Dirt Belt, this hospital is new, clean, and filled with a slew of monks, doctors, and patients. Your escort leads wildly past crowded bedsides and through diverse rooms until, at last, you arrive at a respiration and burns unit situated deep in the hospital's guts.`
	"CN-7115" `	"We have arrived," your guide says, and as soon as you look into the ward he seems to disappear into the crowds of the sprawling hospital.`
	"CN-7116" `	In the ward you find a maimed man with burn scars and slightly labored breathing. His face lights up when he looks at you, and despite his scars you recognize him. It's Timothy Radrickson.`
	"CN-7117" `	Timothy Radrickson, former prison-worker on Oblivion, Governor of Rand, and stowaway of your ship, beckons you step closer to him with his good hand.`
	"CN-7118" `	"Captain <last>. I always hoped I would see you again. Given my tenuous legal situation, not to mention my health, I can't leave here, and I can't send any messages." His eyes linger on you, as though he is taking a mental picture. Or just enjoying the sight of a good friend returned.`
	"CN-7119" `	"The years have been kind to you, Captain; you hardly look any different from when we first met! Perhaps I should have invested in ship life, instead of staying terrestrial!" He laughs at his own joke, but only weakly given his condition. He coughs a bit, and takes a few slow, deep breaths before continuing.`
	"CN-7120" `	"It's still a little difficult for me to speak, but I feel much better than when last we met on Oblivion. I just wanted you to know you're my oldest and best friend. At my lowest points you were always there for me. So thank you for that."`
	"CN-7121" `	You spend the day in the hospital room chatting with Timothy, before finally having to leave.`
	"CN-7122" `	You lean over and give him a partial hug in his sick bed. He wraps his one good arm around you and squeezes. When he finally breaks free you see a tear.`
	"CN-7123" `	You leave him bedridden in the hospital, and to your surprise you find your guide waiting for you outside the room. "His is a tough case. Perhaps one day he will recover enough to leave this place." The monk pauses, thoughtfully. "Or perhaps not."`
	"CN-7124" `	He leads you back to the train station, and from there you take brief journey back to New Tibet's spaceport.`
	"CN-7125" `	You lean in to shake his good hand. He swallows and clears his throat, trying to keep himself from crying.`
	"CN-7126" `	You leave him bedridden in the hospital, and to your surprise find your guide waiting for you outside the room. "His is a tough case. Perhaps one day he will recover enough to leave this place." The monk pauses, thoughtfully. "Or perhaps not."`
	"CN-7127" `	As you speak Timothy shakes his head slowly, tears streaming down his face. Finally, as you finish, he reaches out to you with his one good arm and pulls you in for a hug.`
	"CN-7128" `	He tries to speak, but his voice fails him. Instead he just shakes his teary-eyed head and bows it before you in deep respect.`
	"CN-7129" `	"Always." He manages to whisper through phlegm and weakened lungs as you turn to leave, "always you."`
	"CN-7130" `	You leave him bedridden in the hospital, and to your surprise find your guide waiting for you outside the room.`
	"CN-7131" `	"His is a tough case. Perhaps one day he will recover enough to leave this place." The monk pauses, thoughtfully. "Or perhaps not."`
	"CN-7132" `	He leads you back to the train station, and from there you take the brief journey back to New Tibet's spaceport.`
	"CN-7133" `Oblivion's spaceport is the kind of place that, despite being in constant motion, never really changes. Humanity, driven by its constant thirst for resources, scurries over this unremarkable world like a hive of angry bees, but for all their furious effort it looks no different than any of the previous times you've been here.`
	"CN-7134" `	Except, of course, the lack of one familiar face. A doomed and disgraced ex-governor who had been sent here, and last you heard, had died here.`
	"CN-7135" `	With that heavy thought on your mind you notice a sign which promises to lead you to the local graveyard.`
	"CN-7136" `	(Head to the graveyard.)`
	"CN-7137" `	You see no point in wasting your time at this place's graveyard, so you head back to your ship.`
	"CN-7138" `	Oblivion's evening sky is lit up by unnumbered rigs and natural gas burners that dot the region. These red fires turn the normally dark blue atmosphere a shade of smoldering purple.`
	"CN-7139" `	It's beneath that purple hue you see a countless expanse of small flat gravestones uniformly placed in Oblivion's sterile dirt. Despite the number of headstones there is no one else here, and only a few graves show any evidence of being visited.`
	"CN-7140" `	It seems as though those buried here are mostly forgotten.`
	"CN-7141" `	(Search for Timothy Radrickson's grave.)`
	"CN-7142" `	You've seen all you wanted to see of this place, and you leave this unloved graveyard to its forlorn dead.`
	"CN-7143" `	The index is easy to find, and has all the hallmarks of having never been used. The graveyard is set up in a carefully regimented grid system and despite the large number of graves, it is surprisingly easy to find Timothy's.`
	"CN-7144" `	You walk across the forgotten memorial to find a small, flat unremarkable stone, hemmed in amongst other unremarkable stones, pressed into the dead ground. The text laser-chiseled onto it reads, "Timothy Radrickson. Prisoner - 645631-4C."`
	"CN-7145" `	That's all. Nothing about his meteoric rise, about being the Governor of Rand, or even how or when his death occurred here. Just another dead prisoner.`
	"CN-7146" `	(Stay a while and contemplate.)`
	"CN-7147" `	The slow moving evening clouds have cast the entire world in a strange purple twilight. Timothy's grave sits before you, nestled in the poison ground, and you alone in the vast empty graveyard.`
	"CN-7148" `	Your thoughts drift to the man buried beneath your feet.`
	"CN-7149" `	The shadows turn a darker shade of purple as you leave the graveyard of the forgotten dead for the familiar confines of your ship.`
	"CN-7150" `There is a certain comfort to be found in the familiar swaying of Norn's spaceport. The creaking bridges no longer feel intimidating or threatening, only welcoming. There's never many staff here, but the few you do run into greet you warmly. Word has apparently spread that you've all but been adopted into the Hlewagasti family.`
	"CN-7151" `	Helm, with his sandy hair and short beard, approaches you with a young man in tow. "<first>! It is well to see you again.`
	"CN-7152" `	"So..." he says conspiratorially, "... there is no date yet, but a certain red-haired stoic and his exotic Alfheimian girlfriend may be looking at wedding dates."`
	"CN-7153" `	"Do you know when?"`
	"CN-7154" `	"Who are you talking about?"`
	"CN-7155" `	"I don't really care."`
	"CN-7156" `	"Like I said, there is no date yet, and with those two it could be years before they finally land on a date. Time's different out on the algae islands." He shrugs.`
	"CN-7157" `	"But I thought you'd appreciate a small update on Thorleif." He smiles and then glances at the young man next to him. "Anyways, that's not actually why I sought you out."`
	"CN-7158" `	"You don't remember Thorleif? My cousin out on the algae islands?" He frowns, but regains his composure and glances at the young man next to him. "Anyways, that's not actually why I sought you out."`
	"CN-7159" `	Helm frowns and takes a step back like he's been struck. After a moment he regains his composure and replies, "If you say so. In that case I have another matter to discuss with you."`
	"CN-7160" `	Standing beside Helm is an unremarkable young man with a sunburnt face, calloused hands, and threadbare garb. "Ca-Captain <last>?" he says nervously, "I'm sorry to be a bothering you, ser. But I heard tell what you did for Thorleif, and I thought maybe you were the like to do a good turn by me."`
	"CN-7161" `	Sensing his discomfort, Helm puts an arm on the young man's shoulder. "It's alright, Tosti, we're all friends on Norn."`
	"CN-7162" `	The young man staightens up a bit at Helm's reassurance and looks you in the eyes. "My da, well, he liked the waves well enough, but never really settled here, you see? In his heart that is.`
	"CN-7163" `	"He never really left our old home. We were refugees and were ever so glad to be taken in by Norn, but he never felt so tall as when he thought about Hope, about home."`
	"CN-7164" `	"What are you going on about?"`
	"CN-7165" `	(Wait for him to get the point.)`
	"CN-7166" `	"Leave me alone. I'm not interested."`
	"CN-7167" `	Crestfallen, the young man stumbles over his words attempting to apologize for the intrusion and slinks away from you in an ungraceful hurry.`
	"CN-7168" `	Helm watches him go with an unhappy frown upon his face. "You could have at least heard him out."`
	"CN-7169" `	He shakes his head and turns from you before saying, "I thought better of you."`
	"CN-7170" `	Tosti suddenly stops, and takes a deep breath. "We're from Hope, ser. My family. We're refugees and we had to leave everything behind. But da, he never really left Hope."`
	"CN-7171" `	The young refugee pulls out a stone criss-crossed in tiny chiseled letters. The familiar engraved story of a life now ended. "This is his stone, and well, he - he'd want his stone left on Hope. I was hoping that was something you could do."`
	"CN-7172" `	With the words he swallows and looks at you earnestly.`
	"CN-7173" `	"I can take the stone to Hope."`
	"CN-7174" `	"I can take the stone to Hope, for a price."`
	"CN-7175" `	"I thought Family-Cairns were exclusive to the Deep. Why would there be one on Hope?"`
	"CN-7176" `	"Hire a courier. I have more important things to do."`
	"CN-7177" `	Helm sighs and tries to pat the young man on the back before he entirely deflates. "Captain <last> is a very busy man. I am sure we can find someone else to make the journey. There is no shame in asking for help."`
	"CN-7178" `	Tosti is red and shaking, and mumbles some apologies before slinking away from you and Helm.`
	"CN-7179" `	Helm gives you a nod and says, "Thank you for listening, at least."`
	"CN-7180" `	"Lots of the first folks who settled Hope came from the Deep." Helm answers, getting a far off look in his eyes. "It wasn't like most worlds in the south. It was going to be different. At least, that's what they believed."`
	"CN-7181" `	He shrugs, "Many of them didn't forget where they came from. Brought the old ways with them. Some refugees, like Tosti's family, even found their way back here when Hope was lost.`
	"CN-7182" `	"Anyways, that's why you can find Family-Cairns on Hope - because our people were there. Now, getting back to the matter at hand, you willing to help Tosti out?"`
	"CN-7183" `	He grimaces, "I am sorry, ser. Work is hard to come by for us refugees. I thought - I thought I'd just ask. In case you were near. In case it was within your power is all."`
	"CN-7184" `	"I might be in the area. No promises though."`
	"CN-7185" `	"Alright. I'll do it."`
	"CN-7186" `	"Sorry. I don't work for free."`
	"CN-7187" `	The young man's eyes light up. "Really? Truly? I didn't dare hope..."`
	"CN-7188" `	His body weight shifts and it looks as though he's about to hug you before he abruptly stops himself and tries to regain a little composure.`
	"CN-7189" `	"Thorleif was right about you," he says as he presses the small, cool stone into your hand. "The Family-Cairn is not far from where the last spaceport used to be. Just by the cliffs, and the family name was Snaiwaz."`
	"CN-7190" `	With the stone firmly in your fist, he thanks you one last time, and then takes his leave.`
	"CN-7191" `	Helm silently watches him go and then turns back to you, shaking his head. "You're not like any off-worlder I've ever known. Most would have laughed in that boy's face, let alone done him a good turn for free."`
	"CN-7192" `	He smiles at you and says, "You really are one of us."`
	"CN-7193" `There is nothing here. Only unceasing desolation. The slow churning of hateful ice that swallowed the dream of a world. Yet, here you are. You've landed along the equator, where the environment is not quite so hostile, and where patches of unconquered ice-free rock still reign.`
	"CN-7194" `	Beyond your ship are the ruins of the last unfrozen city. Where the final refugees huddled together awaiting their saviors, the Republic Navy, and were whisked away to other more welcoming worlds.`
	"CN-7195" `	(Explore the area.)`
	"CN-7196" `	(Leave this world.)`
	"CN-7197" `	There is nothing here anyone could want. You leave this abandoned world to its glaciers and ghosts.`
	"CN-7198" `	You break out the cold gear and dress yourself in warm layers with sturdy boots. Furtive frost cracks and breaks as your ship's door opens, and you step out into the cold air. This world's dim light reflects painfully off the ice and snow, momentarily blinding you.`
	"CN-7199" `	Once outside in the sharp, crisp air it's easy to find the dismal ruins of this world's last spaceport. The trek is slow and clumsy in the unfamiliar gravity and granular snow.`
	"CN-7200" `	You work around the silent spaceport, where the half-buried hangars are littered with the forgotten mementos of desperate refugees, and many of the buildings are lost beneath the encroaching ice. Eventually you see a cliff edge with dozens of cairns piled along it. Silent watchers of the churning glaciers.`
	"CN-7201" `	The sun begins to set, and you can already feel the temperature beginning to plummet. There's not much else to see in this abandoned world, and it may be time to head back.`
	"CN-7202" `	(Search for the Snaiwaz Family-Cairn.)`
	"CN-7203" `	(Toss the stone out of the hatch and leave this world.)`
	"CN-7204" `	The stone of Tosti's father tumbles out of the ship and comes to rest in a heap of cluttered refuse. This is as close as it will get to its Family-Cairn, and far closer than Tosti could have gotten it on his own.`
	"CN-7205" `	You work around the silent spaceport, where the half-buried hangars are littered with the forgotten mementos of desperate refugees, and many of the buildings are lost beneath the encroaching ice. Eventually you find the cliffs that Tosti spoke of, and the many dozens of Family-Cairns piled along side it. Silent watchers of the churning glaciers.`
	"CN-7206" `	You see a nearly toppled Family-Cairn with the name "Snaiwaz" at its base.`
	"CN-7207" `	(Place Tosti's father's stone.)`
	"CN-7208" `	(Throw the stone off the side of the cliff.)`
	"CN-7209" `	You hurl the stone far beyond the cliff side and down into glacial slopes beneath it, forever separated from its kindred-stones.`
	"CN-7210" `	Carefully you place Tosti's stone with the others. The act is greeted only by the deafening silence and the icy air of the abandoned world.`
	"CN-7211" `	The sun is setting and your task here is done. You start making your way back through ice and ruin to your ship.`
	"CN-7212" `	As you pass around one corner of the sagging spaceport, you notice a large, ice-free building in the distance with a light burning within.`
	"CN-7213" `	(Enter the building.)`
	"CN-7214" `	(Keep heading toward my ship.)`
	"CN-7215" `	Whatever is going on in that building, it has nothing to do with you, and so you ignore it and return to your waiting ship.`
	"CN-7216" `	You enter into the sturdy and unfrozen building at the edge of the spaceport.`
	"CN-7217" `	Faded wealth still clings to peeling walls of this once spacious manor. It is evident that it was once the heart and hearth of a wealthy family in an earlier, warmer time. The home feels like a tomb or a museum; it seems as if everything here has been left in a certain way for a long time. But as you work deeper into its nested walls you begin to see signs of much more recent life.`
	"CN-7218" `	Eventually you find your way to the kitchen, which appears to be the epicenter of activity in this household. You see assorted survival rations and gear strewn about everywhere. More alarmingly, you also see a young woman sitting on the floor with her back against a counter.`
	"CN-7219" `	"Are you okay?"`
	"CN-7220" `	"What are you doing here?"`
	"CN-7221" `	The woman has short jet black hair. She's wearing a military grade, all-purpose survival suit, the kind you might see on deeply embedded special forces. The only weapon on her is a decorated knife at her belt. She looks pale and frail, probably malnourished. But her icy eyes are clear, and she locks them onto you.`
	"CN-7222" `	"You come into my home, and expect me to answer your questions?" Her voice is steady.`
	"CN-7223" `	Slowly, awkwardly, she pulls herself to her feet, keeping one hand on the counter for balance. She rests her other hand over her knife.`
	"CN-7224" `	"You are lucky that you did not barge in here a year ago, or even a month ago." Despite her bravado there is a deep wariness behind her words. "Now tell me, who are you, and what are you doing here?" she asks, through gritted teeth.`
	"CN-7225" `	(Tell her who I am, and how I was just delivering a stone.)`
	"CN-7226" `	(Tell her who I am, and how I was just out exploring.)`
	"CN-7227" `	(Tell her it's none of her business.)`
	"CN-7228" `	The woman nods slowly, and then painfully, slides back down to the ground.`
	"CN-7229" `	Her eyes fall to the floor. "I have no choice but to trust you. I have lived here all my life, but my equipment has failed. I never wanted to leave, I was never meant to leave, but I won't let the ice win. I won't let it take me, too."`
	"CN-7230" `	She looks back up at you with her piercing eyes. "I am Ildico, last of House Drifa, daughter of Deoric, once one of the most powerful men on Hope. Everyone fled the ice. The Republic Navy made it easy. Enter their ships and be shipped off to paradise, to live as nobodies at the sufferance of strangers.`
	"CN-7231" `	"But we were House Drifa. More than anyone else we built this world, and we would not abandon it to be someone else's dredges. My father bought supplies, equipment, necessities from the Navy. Enough so that me, my brother, and my mother could survive here."`
	"CN-7232" `	She pauses, as though unsure she wants to continue; then finally, in a less firm voice: "And then my father left. He said that dozens of worlds, worse off than ours, were terraformed every day. He said all they needed was a little convincing, and that he would come back with the support to terraform, and save, Hope. And then... he never came back."`
	"CN-7233" `	Ildico sighs. "A treasure hunter killed my brother a few years back. My mother... she is also dead, and I am starving. I have no way to contact anyone else, and no one else is left.`
	"CN-7234" `	"So, what do you say," she says while leaning her head back, clearly exhausted by this exchange. "Will you kill me? Take advantage of me? Save me? Or leave me... to die?"`
	"CN-7235" `	"Come with me. It's time you gave up on Hope."`
	"CN-7236" `	"I'll get you out of here. After that, no promises."`
	"CN-7237" `	"I don't have time for wretches. You're on your own."`
	"CN-7238" `	Ildico, her eyes still closed, takes a deep breath. She opens her eyes just as she lunges at you, with a swift arm motion toward your head. Before you have a chance to react, her knife is embedded deep in your throat.`
	"CN-7239" `	You're on the ground now, with ruby red blood oozing out over the cold floor. You hear a strange moan escaping from your mouth, and Ildico's hands are in your pockets removing everything you have of value.`
	"CN-7240" `	As the world fades to black, you hear her talking, her words sound as though they are coming from a great distance. "Like I said, I won't die here. Thanks for the ship."`
	"CN-7241" `	Your vision grows darker until only a single point of light remains. You don't feel cold, or pain, or anything at all. You just feel heavy. So heavy. Too heavy. So, you let go.`
	"CN-7242" `	You help her back onto her feet, and with her leaning on you, the two of you make your way back outside and through the perilous cold to your ship.`
	"CN-7243" `	Once aboard, after she's eaten and regained a little of her strength, she comes to talk with you.`
	"CN-7244" `	"Thank you for saving me. There are places I need to go. But I know I cannot force you to take me. And I have no credits to pay you. If you could take me to <planet>, I could make my own way from there."`
	"CN-7245" `	"Anywhere you need to go, I can take you."`
	"CN-7246" `	"Okay, I'll take you to <planet>, but after that you're on your own."`
	"CN-7247" `	Ildico narrows her eyes. "Nothing is free."`
	"CN-7248" `	"I just want to make the universe a better place."`
	"CN-7249" `	"It's karma. What goes around comes around."`
	"CN-7250" `	"One day you'll be able to pay me back."`
	"CN-7251" `	"It's how they do things on Norn."`
	"CN-7252" `	"My reasons are my own."`
	"CN-7253" `	Ildico doesn't react for a moment, seemingly taking in your words.`
	"CN-7254" `	At length she nods slowly. "We'll see."`
	"CN-7255" `	She pauses again and then shrugs. "It's not like I have anything to lose... very well. I need to discover what happened to my father. I know he first went to Clark to meet with a terraforming firm there. That's where I start my search."`
	"CN-7256" `Your thrusters kick up fresh dust as you land on your assigned concrete pad in the sprawling spaceport. Ildico, looking less pale and significantly more sturdy, waits by the exit.`
	"CN-7257" `	"Thank you for getting me out of there. After all those years on the ice this place will be no challenge for me. Perhaps someday our paths will cross again. If they do, I will remember this small kindness."`
	"CN-7258" `	She gives you a stern nod, and then exits your ship and into the chaos of Clark.`
	"CN-7259" `Your thrusters kick up fresh dust as you land on your assigned concrete pad on the fringes of the sprawling spaceport. Ildico, looking less pale and significantly more sturdy, waits by the exit.`
	"CN-7260" `	"The terraforming firm is certain to have an office, or booth, in the ramshackle spaceport here. Let's pay them a visit."`
	"CN-7261" `Pushing through the boomtown hustle and bustle, you and Ildico make your way to a series of kiosks, booths, and hastily constructed offices that serve a variety of needs and functions in the ever-growing world of Clark.`
	"CN-7262" `	Among these you find the offices of "Clark's Third Law Terraformists." Ildico steps in front of you and enters first.`
	"CN-7263" `	An older man with greying hair and a bit of a paunch looks up from his desk. He stands up genially as both of you approach and says, "Howdy friends, I am Eustace Goodfellow, and welcome to our cozy establishment. Do you have need of a little terraforming?" Eustace flashes a wide open smile.`
	"CN-7264" `	"Yes. I'd like to terraform the planet Hope." Ildico says flatly.`
	"CN-7265" `	"Well, uh, ma'am. We don't, that is to say, we're not that kind of terraforming firm. We do small jobs. Touch ups. We can't... we can't terraform a world, and I don't..." Eustace looks at both of you carefully before saying, "I don't think you could pay for it either."`
	"CN-7266" `	Ildico leaps over the desk and grabs Eustace by his collar. "Is that what you told my father, Lord of House Drifa? Did you send him away like some misbegotten pauper?"`
	"CN-7267" `	Eustace pales and holds out his hands. "Please, let me go. I meant no insult."`
	"CN-7268" `	(Don't interfere.)`
	"CN-7269" `	(Tell Ildico to calm down.)`
	"CN-7270" `	Ildico releases his collar, but remains only inches from his face. "Did Deoric Drifa come here years ago asking to terraform Hope?"`
	"CN-7271" `	Eustace takes a step back, and nods vigorously. "Yes, yes. I remember him. You don't forget a man like him, or a request like his. He asked about terraforming Hope. As I said earlier, we aren't that kind of firm. I told him he'd have to talk to the Academy of Planetary Sciences on <planet> for that kinda work. And then he left.`
	"CN-7272" `	"Please." Eustace says, backing up further. "That's all I know about him. I never saw him again."`
	"CN-7273" `	Ildico stares at him for a few more moments, and then turns and passes you on her way to the exit.`
	"CN-7274" `	She opens the door and nods to you. "We're going to <planet>."`
	"CN-7275" `To some Glory is a testament to human ingenuity, skill, and potential. It is the dream made real, the promise proven true. A world perfectly sculpted to suit the needs, desires, and tastes of humanity. Nothing here is left to chance; every inch carefully, artfully, manifested by man's will.`
	"CN-7276" `	And yet, to others, it is grotesque, a mockery of nature. A lie made into a monument. As you deal with the Republic spaceport officials you notice the plastic-perfect denizens walking around, staring at your defective face and your workworn ship.`
	"CN-7277" `	"There is no beauty here," Ildico says vacantly when you're finished with the officials. "Only vanity."`
	"CN-7278" `	The spaceport's transport terminal has a direct rail link to the Academy of Planetary Sciences. Perhaps you could find out what happened to Ildico's father in the Academy.`
	"CN-7279" `The Academy of Planetary Sciences is a campus the size of a small nation-state on Earth. Various artificially created and maintained microclimates abound as you travel between miniature mountains and micro-savannahs; between marshland and jungle, desert and forest. Impossible machines - some larger than skyscrapers - litter the twisted and ever-changing landscape, and terraforming satellites make meteor showers overhead in the dawn light. This is a place where anything is possible, and land bends eagerly to the whims of the terraforming wizards.`
	"CN-7280" `	Eventually, Ildico and you make it to the primary reception complex, where after hours of filling out inane forms, and waiting in different meaningless queues, you finally reach someone who can help you. An old visitor list shows that one Deoric Drifa had visited a Professor Ian McGiven, Second Degree Terraformer and World Warming specialist in JZ86 Cantos-B of Cooling Block 9 in the Everest Facility.`
	"CN-7281" `	The receptionist helpfully draws you a map to where you're going. She also lets you know that in order to visit him you'll need to fill out six other forms first. You get to work.`
	"CN-7282" `	(Fill out the forms.)`
	"CN-7283" `	You input your standard credentials. Full name, date of birth, location of birth, occupation, ID, social and civil information, and signature. You flip the form over, moving to the next.`
	"CN-7284" `	(Fill out more forms.)`
	"CN-7285" `	A page straight out of an entry exam faces you. Accompanied by a set of dots representing if or how often you have caught them, are dozens of labels noting common diseases along with illnesses you thought had been eradicated. The majority of options consist of words and names you imagine must represent some serious conditions, but which you have no recollection of ever reading or hearing about. After scraping your memory as best as you can for your medical history, you eventually finish filling out the last set of dots, and sign. Sighing, you flip the form.`
	"CN-7286" `	(Continue filling out forms.)`
	"CN-7287" `	You begin to wonder how it was less bureaucratically stressful to purchase your first ship than it is to schedule an encounter with a campus professor here. When the form prompts you for your address, you scramble out of the room to research what spaceship captains should fill out in such cases. After many contradicting forums and blatantly outdated government websites, you return and put in the best answer you can think of. Then the form specifically requires you to input the institution you studied at, here on <origin>. Again you set to look for answers on how to respond when you are not even from the planet this form is from. After a few more questions, you start to zone out and just automatically input whatever seems least likely to get the form rejected, based on online tips and nebulous descriptions from government pages.`
	"CN-7288" `	The receptionist brings a few of the earlier forms you filled out and helpfully points out a few mistakes for you to fix.`
	"CN-7289" `	(Fix the forms I already filled out.)`
	"CN-7290" `	As it turns out, your bank account is not compatible with the due process the forms here are a part of. You download an application to open your very own account on one of the local banks, after checking with the receptionist that this one is compatible. After a few more minutes (and a great many attempts at fitting your face in a camera shot for a mandatory facial recognition step) your new bank details are ready and filled in the forms, which you turn over with haste. Surely it must be ending soon.`
	"CN-7291" `	(Fill out the final set of forms.)`
	"CN-7292" `	In this wondrous paradise of terraforming, a true testament to human ingenuity and mastery over nature, you are close to fuming with frustration at the inability of the local machinery to recognize your signature. For the better part of an hour you get to work on every form again, straining your arms as you slowly, carefully imprint your signature again, on every one of them, as identical to each other as you can.`
	"CN-7293" `	A few painfully tedious hours after you first arrived, all the right forms have been filled out and you're met by an intern in a small vehicle.`
	"CN-7294" `	She glances at her electronic clipboard. "Captain <last>? Lady Drifa? I am here to escort you to the Everest Facility." She opens the door and gestures to you two. "Please climb aboard. I know the confines are quite small, but the E.F. is only a few kilometers away."`
	"CN-7295" `	Ildico glares at the young woman suspiciously, then turns to you. "Can we trust her?"`
	"CN-7296" `	The intern looks confused and a little hurt, but says nothing.`
	"CN-7297" `	"We can trust her. We're in no danger here."`
	"CN-7298" `	"I'll protect you. Don't worry."`
	"CN-7299" `	"We have no choice if you want answers."`
	"CN-7300" `	Ildico nods and then enters the vehicle and you follow behind her.`
	"CN-7301" `	Ildico barks out a laugh. "So naive. We are always in danger. But for answers I will risk it."`
	"CN-7302" `	She carefully checks the inside of the vehicle before carefully climbing in.`
	"CN-7303" `	(Follow her in.)`
	"CN-7304" `	Ildico laughs heartily and sheds a couple tears. "You? Protect me?" She wipes her tears as her mirth subsides and her cold intense coutenance reasserts itself.`
	"CN-7305" `	"No, <first>. I will protect you." Her voice is deadly serious. She then inspects the inside of the vehicle carefully and takes a seat. "It seems safe. And I need answers."`
	"CN-7306" `	After a brief ride through the campus you are escorted deeper and deeper into the maze that is the Everest Facility. Another half an hour of hallways, and turns, and stairs and ups and downs, you finally find yourself inside Ian McGiven's office.`
	"CN-7307" `	The man hears your inquiry and nods earnestly. "Ah, yes, of course I remember the fellow! What an interesting meeting that was," Ian says from behind his small desk.`
	"CN-7308" `	"Obviously, the details are confidential, but in very broad generalities, he wanted me to warm up a freezing world."`
	"CN-7309" `	Ildico doesn't blink; on second thought, you're not sure you've ever seen her blink. "Hope. Yes, and could you warm it?"`
	"CN-7310" `	Ian laughs. "Oh, of course, a job like that would have been quite simple."`
	"CN-7311" `	"Then why didn't you?" The tension is obvious in Ildico's voice.`
	"CN-7312" `	Ian shrugs. "Though he could afford it, there were other concerns."`
	"CN-7313" `	Ildico steps forward and looms over Ian like an angry shadow. It appears that it is taking all of her willpower to keep her from ripping this man apart. "Concerns?"`
	"CN-7314" `	"Y-yes. I don't know the specifics. You have to understand, here at the Academy it's not just about money. It's about politics, and power. I am just a Second Degree Terraformer, and after the initial meeting I wasn't privy to the details. But someone, or some government or corporation didn't want it. If you want to know more you'll have to ask him yourself."`
	"CN-7315" `	Ildico seems to deflate. "Ask him? Is... is he here?"`
	"CN-7316" `	The terraformer shakes his head. "Oh, no. He doesn't work for the Academy. But after the rejection he went to the heart of the Republic, I assume to find out why. He now works for them. I see his name from time to time. Just head to the Republic's main office for the Department of Migration, which is located on Chiron."`
	"CN-7317" `	Without saying another word, Ildico turns and leaves. You thank Ian for his help and follow her out.`
	"CN-7318" `It's easy to imagine Earth once looked and felt much like Chiron does today. A vibrant world, full of engaged and motivated people, all in a hurry to change the universe - or at least, to run it.`
	"CN-7319" `	The Department of Migration, Stellar Populations and Advanced Interplanetary Economics is easy enough to find. What's surprising is how quickly you are ushered into a waiting room outside the office of one Mr. Drifa, Sub-Executive of Multiplanetary Pricing.`
	"CN-7320" `	After a brief wait, a young secretary announces that Mr. Drifa is ready to see you, and brings you and Ildico into his office.`
	"CN-7321" `	"So what can I help you with..." Deoric Drifa's voice trails off as he sees Ildico.`
	"CN-7322" `	Ildico tries to step forward than stops herself. She freezes up.`
	"CN-7323" `	"It can't be," the elder Drifa whispers.`
	"CN-7324" `	"Why. Didn't. You. Come?" Ildico forces out each word.`
	"CN-7325" `	"I sent for you. They told me you were all dead. They found bodies... and the generator blown."`
	"CN-7326" `	"The accident..." Ildico says more to herself than anyone else. And then in that instant she unfreezes, emotions roil through her, and she runs to her father, with everything forgiven.`
	"CN-7327" `	After a long tear-filled embrace she disengages and wipes her eyes. "Early on the generator blew and we had to evacuate the compound. Some people died... including Hogne." She glances at you and says, "He was my older brother."`
	"CN-7328" `	She continues, "I salvaged what I could and set up at home. I've been there the whole time."`
	"CN-7329" `	"It's my fault," Deoric says. "I should have gone and looked for you myself. I would have known where to look."`
	"CN-7330" `	They talk about family, the time apart, and what happened back on Hope. Finally, Ildico turns her attention back to you.`
	"CN-7331" `	"Thank you for bringing me here, <first>. For sticking with me. I appreciate it." She gives you the first real genuine smile you've seen on her face.`
	"CN-7332" `	"No problem, Ildico."`
	"CN-7333" `	"You're welcome, Ildico."`
	"CN-7334" `	She looks at you for just a moment, as if in thought, and then says, "If we ever meet again, call me Ildy. It's what my friends call me."`
	"CN-7335" `	With that you take your leave.`
	"CN-7336" `Your inbox blinks with a new message from Ildico on Chiron:`
	"CN-7337" `	"I need to see you. Please come. My address is attached.`
	"CN-7338" `				-your friend`
	"CN-7339" `					Ildy"`
	"CN-7340" `The myriad lights of urban settlements twinkle in the dusk as you approach the capital, and main spaceport, of Chiron. Crickets, brought from old Earth, chirp in the twilight air. Your ship parked, you'll need to make your way to the main spaceport to hire transportation to Ildico's address.`
	"CN-7341" `The directions Ildico gave you take you beyond the bustling city and out into the large estates owned by the Republic political elite; Drifa Manor sits atop a low hill with what must be a very expensive view of New Sydney. The architecture of the building is reminiscent of upper-class villas you've seen in the Deep.`
	"CN-7342" `	As you approach the main gate you find it wide open, and the attached security booth is abandoned. You could just walk right in.`
	"CN-7343" `	(Walk right in.)`
	"CN-7344" `	(Investigate before entering.)`
	"CN-7345" `	The gate itself appears to have been opened from the inside, not broken into, and there are no signs of a struggle in the security booth. The employee parking beyond is also completely empty. It seems everyone left fast and didn't bother to close the gate behind them. You're entirely alone out here.`
	"CN-7346" `	Whatever this is; you decide you aren't interested. Ildico will just have to fend for herself.`
	"CN-7347" `	The spacious building is eerily empty of servants. Doors are left often, incomplete tasks clutter the floor. Whatever happened here, the people left in a hurry.`
	"CN-7348" `	There's a loud crashing noise in the floor above you. You ascend the central grand staircase following the noise.`
	"CN-7349" `	There are streaks of crimson blood across the opulent decor and a pool of it settles in the center of the room. Lavish baroque furniture is stained with the carnage.`
	"CN-7350" `	At the center of it all is a ravaged dead body on the floor, and above it stands a bloody, grinning Ildico.`
	"CN-7351" `	"Ildico, what's going on?"`
	"CN-7352" `	"Are you hurt? Do you need help?"`
	"CN-7353" `	"What have you done?"`
	"CN-7354" `	She ignores you, her attention focused elsewhere.`
	"CN-7355" `	"You thought," Ildico says as she catches her breath, "that you could sell me? That you could give me to this bureaucrat who signed Hope's death warrant?" She kicks the lifeless body at her feet. "That I would be your pawn, your tool, your object in order to gain favor and promotion?"`
	"CN-7356" `	The raven-haired woman laughs, as she cleans off her bloody dagger, and takes a step toward a figure cowering in the corner. The man you recognize as her father.`
	"CN-7357" `	"Wh-what have you done? You've ruined everything. I was so close. I would have had it all." Deoric blinks, his face sets in hard, and he straightens up, he looks as if he just remembered who he is.`
	"CN-7358" `	"You stupid, selfish, arrogant brat. You just needed to do as you were told. To play your pathetic part. You couldn't, could you? You were always worthless. If only your brother had survived." Deoric picks up a broken furniture leg and confidently wields it like a club.`
	"CN-7359" `	At this Ildico's wicked grin widens deeper. "My brother? Dear Hogne. Father, I killed him. He couldn't handle the ice, the isolation, the hopelessness of Hope. He lost his mind. He tried to make me his wife. And mother? She cracked long before that. An entitled debutante like her had no chance in that hellhole, and I? I needed to eat."`
	"CN-7360" `	The color drains out of Deoric's face. "Monster." He says. "I will put an end to you. I will start a new family, as I should have before."`
	"CN-7361" `	Deoric lunges at Ildico, but before he can take more then a single step, Ildico's wrist flicks and her knife slams into Deoric's throat. He falls to the ground, bleeding out, dying.`
	"CN-7362" `	Ildico stands over him. "You are a coward. A miserable disgusting man." She spits on him, and pulls her dagger from his heaving neck. He tries to speak as his dying body squirms, but no words materialize and he goes still.`
	"CN-7363" `	She turns to you. "I am now a fugitive, and you are my only friend. I need you to get us out of here."`
	"CN-7364" `	Ildico walks back to corner far from any of the fighting, and retrieves a bundled baby you'd neglected to notice until now.`
	"CN-7365" `	"You got it. Let's go."`
	"CN-7366" `	"Anything for you, Ildy."`
	"CN-7367" `	"Sure, but you owe me. Big."`
	"CN-7368" `	"No way. You're a murderer. I want nothing to do with you."`
	"CN-7369" `	"Stop right there. I am putting you under citizen's arrest until the police arrive."`
	"CN-7370" `	She nods, her face softens, and tears glitter around her eyes. "Thank you, I knew- I knew I could count on you."`
	"CN-7371" `	Ildico recollects herself for a moment before pointing to a briefcase lying by a table. "Grab that, and let's go."`
	"CN-7372" `	"Go where?"`
	"CN-7373" `	"What's in the briefcase?"`
	"CN-7374" `	The recently widowed woman gives you a suspicious look, but then nods. "What I need to survive.`
	"CN-7375" `	"Now grab it, and let's go."`
	"CN-7376" `	(Grab the briefcase.)`
	"CN-7377" `	"We need to go where the Republic cannot. Take us to <planet>." She gives you a serious look and adds, "And do not let anyone scan your ship until we get there."`
	"CN-7378" `	The three of you escape out into the night and onto your ship.`
	"CN-7379" `	She sighs. "Not the Republic, nor the Free Worlds. After tonight I will be hunted. We need to go to <planet>." She looks at you seriously and says, "And do not let anyone scan your ship until we get there."`
	"CN-7380" `	Ildico puts her baby back down, and for just a second you see agony in her eyes. Killing her father or her arranged husband didn't break her mask, but somehow this does. A tear rolls down her cheek. She moves fast, her arm darting and pointing a course at you, but the distance gives you just enough time to move. You barely avoid her dagger, and point your sidearm straight at her.`
	"CN-7381" `	As you use your communicator to call the local authorities, Ildico glares at you, a broken expression on her face. "I thought I had one friend. What a fool I was. I'll never make that mistake again," is all she says, just as the security officers arrive. After a struggle, they manage to restrain Ildico, and separate her from the baby. Her stare pierces you all the way out of the estate. The officer in charge of the arrest thanks you for the report and for keeping Ildico in place until they arrived. They assure you that Ildico will be given a fair trial, and that the baby will be handled with care.`
	"CN-7382" `	You watch the security vehicles take them both away, suddenly aware that you will likely never see either of them again.`
	"CN-7383" `	Ildico puts her baby back down, and for just a second you see agony in her eyes. Killing her father or her arranged husband didn't break her mask, but somehow this does. A tear rolls down her cheek.`
	"CN-7384" `	Her hand wavers, trembles, over her knife, and then she drops it, and her head. "So then go."`
	"CN-7385" `Having evaded Republic patrols on the lookout for the "Murderous Heiress," you make it to the pirate planet of Haven. Ildico watches the dismal landscape as you land and says, almost curtly, "It'll do."`
	"CN-7386" `	She opens the briefcase she took off Chiron, revealing a storage device and an oranate wooden box.`
	"CN-7387" `	Ildico gives you a sly smile. "It took years, but the majority of the Drifa fortune has been smuggled into this storage device. They thought I was meek, malleable, and pitiful. Not a threat. They were fools."`
	"CN-7388" `	She holds up the box. "And in this, well, this may take some explaining. Before we migrated to Hope, the Drifa were old nobility in the Deep. Legend says we ruled Valhalla before the first ships came. Whatever the truth, my ancestors had this in their possession as a sign of their royalty, this bauble."`
	"CN-7389" `	Ildico opens the rune-carved lid of the box, revealing a faintly glowing red rock. "It is called the Blood of Surtr, and it was said to have been the symbol of our rulership, and more importantly, a source of power."`
	"CN-7390" `	She shrugs. "I know it sounds far-fetched. But I had this with me on Hope, and I don't think I would have survived without it. When the generators went down, this kept the lights on.`
	"CN-7391" `	"But its time with me is over. I want you, the last friend of House Drifa, and the only person who has shown me any kindness in many years, to have it.`
	"CN-7392" `	"I'll also transfer a small sum of money for your troubles. I fear I will be needing most of my family's fortune, but hopefully what little I can offer will help."`
	"CN-7393" `	"Is it wise for you and your child to be left alone in a place like Haven?"`
	"CN-7394" `	She laughs. "After surviving on Hope and Chiron? Haven will be a cakewalk."`
	"CN-7395" `	"No, it is my appreciation that has to be given. You have done what few would have the conviction to do."`
	"CN-7396" `	She takes her child in one hand, and the briefcase in the other, and walks off your ship.`
	"CN-7397" `Your inbox blinks with a new message from Ildico from Haven:`
	"CN-7398" `	"It's been too long, and I could use your help. Please, come to <planet>.`
	"CN-7399" `				- Your friend,`
	"CN-7400" `Even from orbit, Haven looks ugly, and as you approach the planet it doesn't get any better. Upon landing you're alerted Ildico is waiting for you in the spaceport.`
	"CN-7401" `You arrive at the address Ildico gave you; a large warehouse on the edge of the spaceport. When you step into the dimly lit building, your eyes struggle to adjust, and gradually you realize you're face-to-face with a group of dirty burly men and women leveling a half-dozen weapons right at you.`
	"CN-7402" `	"Looks like someone's lost," a voice rises from the group, though you can't tell who's speaking.`
	"CN-7403" `	"They look right fancy. Good thing we found them."`
	"CN-7404" `	"Whaddya say, Frank, kill 'em now? Or keep 'em for a bit? Maybe their worth something? Maybe we can have some fun with 'em."`
	"CN-7405" `	"I am looking for Ildy."`
	"CN-7406" `	"Ildy asked me to come here."`
	"CN-7407" `	"Ildy, help!"`
	"CN-7408" `	(Grab my sidearm and shoot my way out.)`
	"CN-7409" `	The band of cut-throats looks at you, confused, and then most of them lower their weapons.`
	"CN-7410" `	"Boss," one of them hollers, "this stranger says they're here for you, I think."`
	"CN-7411" `	Footsteps echo on the opposite side of the warehouse as someone approaches.`
	"CN-7412" `	One of the men starts laughing. "Ildy?! Haha, never thought to call her that. Hey Ildy! How come you never told us to call you that? Or that some kind of special pet name?"`
	"CN-7413" `	The man flashes an unsavory grin at you, with his rotting teeth on full display.`
	"CN-7414" `	In the dim light the footsteps materialize into a woman in her mid-thirties with hair darker than vacuum. Ildico Drifa gives you a warm smile, then lifts up a gun and fires.`
	"CN-7415" `	(Duck.)`
	"CN-7416" `	(Jump to the side.)`
	"CN-7417" `	You don't flinch as the rotten-toothed man besides you crumples to the ground, a bullet hole in his head.`
	"CN-7418" `	You jump to the side, knocking against some empty barrels, only to realize she wasn't aiming at you. The rotten-toothed man lies dead on the ground, a bullet hole in his head.`
	"CN-7419" `	You duck, startled by the attack, only to realize she wasn't aiming at you. The rotten-toothed man lies dead on the ground, a bullet hole in his head.`
	"CN-7420" `	She looks to the rest of her crew, "Only my friends call me Ildy. And I have only one friend."`
	"CN-7421" `	"Yes, boss."`
	"CN-7422" `	"Got it, boss."`
	"CN-7423" `	"Sure thing, Cap."`
	"CN-7424" `	"Whatever you say, boss."`
	"CN-7425" `	The group of pirates melt away into the warehouse, one of them dragging the dead body, leaving you and Ildy relatively alone.`
	"CN-7426" `	"I'm glad you came, <first>." Ildico puts a friendly hand on your shoulder and squeezes.`
	"CN-7427" `	She turns and waves toward the warehouse. "This is my temporary headquarters. I have few other safe-houses, and I own part of a hangar elsewhere. Not too many ships yet, but that will change soon."`
	"CN-7428" `	Ildico holsters her gun right next to where she keeps her ornate dagger and continues. "But making moves is hard. Everyone wants to be on top. Which is why I need you."`
	"CN-7429" `	She looks you in the eye and says, "There's a rival gang right next door. They have a lot more firepower, but if they could be removed, we could easily double our territory.`
	"CN-7430" `	"I don't have the ships," she glances at her gang in the distance, "or the quality of crew, to deal with them.`
	"CN-7431" `	"But I think you do. I can't afford to pay you right now, things are pretty fluid, but I'll owe you. So, are you in?"`
	"CN-7432" `	"Sure, I'll help."`
	"CN-7433" `	"Fine. But you're going to owe me big when this is all over."`
	"CN-7434" `	"Not interested."`
	"CN-7435" `	Her smile lights up the dim room. "I always know I can count on you. And only you."`
	"CN-7436" `	"I fed the gang some false information. They have their entire fleet hunting some juicy merchant ships that don't actually exist, so they'll be surprised when they find you instead."`
	"CN-7437" `	"Check out the nearby systems and look for their flagship, the <npc>. Kill them all, and come back here. To me."`
	"CN-7438" `	Ildico frowns. She looks down at her feet for a moment, and when she looks back up her face is a mask of rage and hurt. "Then get out."`
	"CN-7439" `	Acting defiantly in the face of so much danger, you reach for your sidearm. Unfortunately, it's in vain, because as soon as you feel the pistol grip in your hand you simultaneously feel the burning sensations of a flurry of bullets entering your body and tearing apart your insides.`
	"CN-7440" `There's been intense fighting around the district where Ildico's warehouse was located. A few gunshots echo as you make your way through the rubble and around the fires.`
	"CN-7441" `	A group of injured but high-spirited pirates are set up outside the building, and there are bodies littering the nearby streets. An unharmed but bloody Ildico walks up to you, smiling. She is trailed by a small incongruous toddler with short black hair and lopsided grin.`
	"CN-7442" `	"Perfect. They never had a chance." She wipes the blood off her dagger, and notices your gaze.`
	"CN-7443" `	"The safest place for her was by my side," she says matter-of-factly to you, then she kneels down to her daughter. "Randalin, this is <first>. You met them long ago when you were a baby. <first> is my friend."`
	"CN-7444" `	She stands up again and looks back at you. "And <first>, this is Randalin. She's grown a bit since last you saw her."`
	"CN-7445" `	"Hi, Randalin. It's wonderful to meet you."`
	"CN-7446" `	(Nod at the child.)`
	"CN-7447" `	"She was with you for the battle?"`
	"CN-7448" `	Ildico shrugs. "Who would I trust with her? Who could I trust with her? Only you, <first>, and you were elsewhere."`
	"CN-7449" `	The little girl lifts a chubby fist up to you.`
	"CN-7450" `	(Fist bump her.)`
	"CN-7451" `	(Shake her fist.)`
	"CN-7452" `	You awkwardly take her fist in your hand and shake it up and down. Randalin giggles, and babbles something incoherent.`
	"CN-7453" `	Her small fist bumps against yours. She then gives you an easy grin and babbles something incoherent.`
	"CN-7454" `	"She's not quite got the hang of words yet. But they'll come," Ildico says approvingly.`
	"CN-7455" `	Ilidco puts a hand on Randalin's shoulder and draws her close. She turns her attention back to the battlefield.`
	"CN-7456" `	"This is only the beginning, <first>." Her eyes blaze as she speaks, "House Drifa will rise again. You'll see. You'll be there."`
	"CN-7457" `	She glances back toward her mulling forces. "Thanks again, it means a lot that I can count on you, but I have to work to do. Until next time."`
	"CN-7458" `	Ildico returns to her group, barking orders and gesturing at the rubble, leaving you to your own devices.`
	"CN-7459" `A news kiosk is doing a segment on the growing threat of pirates around Haven. A certain name catches your eye, and you read:`
	"CN-7460" `	Self-styled "pirate queen" Ildico Drifa continues to expand her territory and reach. While there is some concern this growing centralization of power could result in greater threats to trade and stability in the Far North, most analysts think it is quite unlikely.`
	"CN-7461" `	Professor Grenwich Millstone, foremost authority on the economy and history of the northern pirate worlds, had this to say about Drifa:`
	"CN-7462" `	"It is patently inconceivable that any single magnate could consolidate power on Haven. It is cultural anathema, and economically impractical. Frankly, all this talk of a so-called 'pirate queen' is just sensationalist journalism trying to sell the news. In a few weeks another pirate captain will be the new bogeyman, and then another."`
	"CN-7463" `	The segment ends, and the news kiosk automatically scrolls down to the next article.`
	"CN-7464" `As your ship descends through Windblain's cloudy atmosphere, you consider landing near Hrithfjall and asking the Ondurdis about the Blood of Surtr.`
	"CN-7465" `	(Take the Blood of Surtr to Hrithfjall.)`
	"CN-7466" `	(Ask about the Blood of Surtr another time.)`
	"CN-7467" `	(Don't visit Hrithfjall at all.)`
	"CN-7468" `	You fly past Hrithfjall without landing and continue on your way.`
	"CN-7469" `	You pass numerous new homes built of driftwood and sea-stone as you approach the old village center of Hrithfjall. There is laughter and song in the air and children running everywhere; it always seems larger every time you visit.`
	"CN-7470" `	At the old village hall you find the Ondurdis and Aldfrith deep in conversation with a band of people who stick out beside the Skadenga and indigenous Ranfolk; these people appear to be foreigners. The Ondurdis's old eyes light up and she gives you a grandmotherly smile as you approach.`
	"CN-7471" `	"<first>!" the Ondurdis exclaims happily. "My heart sings to see you."`
	"CN-7472" `	"Who are they?"`
	"CN-7473" `	"I've come to show you something."`
	"CN-7474" `	"What do you know about other stones like the Tear of Skade?"`
	"CN-7475" `	"On Skade? Only Tears of Skade. But on other worlds? Maybe."`
	"CN-7476" `	The Ondurdis steps away from the group and takes you aside, leaving Aldfrith to continue talking with them.`
	"CN-7477" `	"They are from Alfheim. They say their culture and world dying and they look for new home before old one gone." She pats your arm gently.`
	"CN-7478" `	"Word spreads of Hrithfjell and in some corners of Deep old ways still remembered. So they come." Her eyes gleam, "We are like fire on glacier. All see, all come. For warmth, for happiness, for life.`
	"CN-7479" `	"But, <first>, you have not come all this way to talk with old woman. What brings you here?"`
	"CN-7480" `	You show her the Blood of Surtr, and tell her the story of House Drifa taking it from the Deep.`
	"CN-7481" `	The Ondurdis nods slowly. "I only know of Tears of Skade. Our Goddess cried - maybe others did as well?"`
	"CN-7482" `	She turns and motions to Aldfrith who steps over to you. She asks, "Did Ran ever cry cold tears?"`
	"CN-7483" `	Aldfrith inspects the Blood of Surtr thoughtfully, and then considers the Ondurdis's words as he strokes his white beard. "The sea has no mercy, and no memory. Ran would never cry."`
	"CN-7484" `	He chews his lip and then says slowly and carefully, "But she did leave us scales."`
	"CN-7485" `	He nods to himself and becomes more confident. "Long ago we would find the Scales of Ran on the beaches nearest her God-Stone. The stories say that they made a bubble of breathable air around those who carried them, and allowed us to explore the secrets of her depths."`
	"CN-7486" `	"What happened to them?"`
	"CN-7487" `	"Where could I find them?"`
	"CN-7488" `	Aldfrith shakes his head slowly. "In the time of my grandfather the men from the Deep came and took the Scales off world. They said they were too valuable to be left in the hands of savages, and since then we've never found another Scale of Ran. I think she was displeased we allowed them to be taken."`
	"CN-7489" `	The old man pauses for a moment and then says, "Although... I do remember when I was a child the folk from the Deep coming and visiting us again. They had questions about... our baubles. I think they said they did not work? They thought they were just useless charms. Perhaps the Scales stopped working?"`
	"CN-7490" `	He shrugs. "I am sorry, <first>, that I cannot tell you more."`
	"CN-7491" `	The Ondurdis puts a hand on his back. "I value your stories." She turns her attention back to you, "Stone-magic fades when outsiders come, this is known. Maybe all God-Stones once gave such gifts, but no longer."`
	"CN-7492" `	She points at the Blood of Surtr. "Surtr, is known, he is volcano that erupts on ice. He is black fire that swallows world. But he had no God-Stone on Nifel." She pauses and looks at Aldfrith.`
	"CN-7493" `	"Oh, uh, and none here. Ran, like the sea, is jealous and would share no world with another." Aldfrith says quickly.`
	"CN-7494" `	"Maybe on other world, there is Surtr God-Stone, and from it he bleeds. More than that, I do not know," she says apologetically.`
	"CN-7495" `	You thank the Ondurdis and Aldfrith for their gracious help and interesting stories. The Ondurdis hastily prepares a small meal, believing it bad manners to let a guest leave unfed, and wishes you well in your future travels among the lofty stars.`
	"CN-7496" `In the quiet, creaking spaceport, it's easy enough to spot Helm doing some much needed maintenance on the ships that have landed here for the night. The last time you met him, he asked you to bring a stone to Hope. Do you want to check in with him?`
	"CN-7497" `	(Go to Helm and report on the stone.)`
	"CN-7498" `	(Leave Helm alone.)`
	"CN-7499" `	As you say your hello you accidentally startle Helm, who's in the middle of recalibrating a repulsor.`
	"CN-7500" `	"Woah! <first>! No need to sneak up on me!" He stands up to greet you. "What's new?"`
	"CN-7501" `	"Is Tosti around? I found his Family-Cairn and left the stone there."`
	"CN-7502" `	"It's done. I chucked the stone out of a hatch, but it's at least on Hope now."`
	"CN-7503" `	"I threw the stone off a cliff, but it's at least on Hope now."`
	"CN-7504" `	"Where's Tosti?"`
	"CN-7505" `	"Ah, Tosti's out on the seas. The lad got himself a job working on a fishing trawler. It'll likely be a few years before he'll call to port here again."`
	"CN-7506" `	Helm gives you a friendly smile. "Still, you've done him a good turn. I'll have a message passed along to him so he knows he can rest easy."`
	"CN-7507" `	He returns to tinkering with the repulsor but continues, "There's no money or reward, but word will spread and people here will appreciate it all the same. Here on Norn we have long memories."`
	"CN-7508" `	Helm stops what's he doing and looks up at you searchingly. "Best keep that to yourself, then. You of all people should know that folks around here take stone-bearing pretty seriously."`
	"CN-7509" `	He sighs, "Still, better than not being on Hope at all, I suppose. As for Tosti, he's out on the seas. Got himself a job working on a fishing trawler. It'd likely be a few years before he'll call to port here again."`
	"CN-7510" `	He turns and looks out over Norn's endless oceans. "I'll have a message sent to him so he knows he can rest easy. I'll of course leave out the part about you tossing the stone. No reason to give him grief."`
	"CN-7511" `	He returns to tinkering with the repulsor but continues, "There's no money or reward, but a good deed is its own reward, isn't it?`
	"CN-7512" `	"At least that's what I believe," he says more to himself than to you.`
	"CN-7513" `At night, the spaceport on <origin> livens up. There are porters running to and from depots with crates, crewmen buying rounds of drinks for each other around the bars before they hit the bed, and bands of Navy officers jovially greeting captains and systematically inspecting ships. The energy and self-purpose of this spaceport is on full display tonight.`
	"CN-7514" `	The only exception to the bustle and activity are a young man and woman, both dressed very formally, who are seemingly lost. You watch them drift from one person to another, each time being sent off without an answer. Finally, they come toward you.`
	"CN-7515" `	Their faces show clearly that they are on their last legs of hope. It is only with reluctance that the woman says, "Excuse me, are you a spaceship captain?"`
	"CN-7516" `	"Yes, my name's Captain <last>."`
	"CN-7517" `	"Depends on what you want."`
	"CN-7518" `	Her face brightens up with a smile, and she continues, "That's good to hear! My brother and I were searching for someone who could give us a ride to <destination>. We received notice that our father's last will is going to be published there on <day>. Do you think you could take us there? We can pay you for your service, of course: <payment>."`
	"CN-7519" `	She seems a little confused. "Oh, um... my brother and I were just searching for someone who could give us a ride to <destination>. We received notice that our father's last will is going to be published there on <day>. Do you think you could take us there? We can pay you for your service, of course: <payment>.`
	"CN-7520" `	"Of course I can."`
	"CN-7521" `	"I'm sorry, but I've got more urgent things to do. You'll need to find someone else."`
	"CN-7522" `	Her smile fades away as you say that, but they both simply nod and walk out of the spaceport with their heads down.`
	"CN-7523" `	"Fantastic! My name is Sophie, and this is my younger brother," she says, pointing at the man to her side, who goes to shake your hand.`
	"CN-7524" `	"Hi, I'm Liam. We've been looking for a ride for some time now. We were starting to worry that we wouldn't get there in time! You'll have to bring us there quickly."`
	"CN-7525" `	"Don't worry, you'll be surprised how fast my ship flies. We'll get there in no time."`
	"CN-7526" `	"Yes, a lot of captains are quite busy these days."`
	"CN-7527" `	"It seems that way," Sophie agrees. "Everyone feels more tense or uncertain. There's always more to do and less time to do it."`
	"CN-7528" `	Liam's voice barely hides his excitement at finding an available captain. "Well, let's see that ship of yours then, and show us if it's as fast as you say it is!"`
	"CN-7529" `	You lead them to your ship and help them with their bags as they board.`
	"CN-7530" `When you arrive at <planet>'s spaceport, the siblings prepare to head off to the court where their father's last will will be read out. Just before they leave, Liam turns to you. "Captain <last>, I've transferred <payment> to your account. Would it be okay for you to wait here until we come back? We'll need a ride home. If you're able to take us, please meet us in the spaceport later."`
	"CN-7531" `After waiting two hours in the spaceport's bar, Liam and Sophie come back with unexpectedly broad smiles on their faces. You flag them down from your table and they eagerly take a seat.`
	"CN-7532" `	Liam speaks as soon as he can. "Captain <last>, it turns out we will need a bit more than just a ride home! Have you decided to help us again?"`
	"CN-7533" `	"What do you want me to do?"`
	"CN-7534" `	"Tell me more before I decide."`
	"CN-7535" `	Sophie smiles at her brother. "Of course, Liam just can't wait to get started!" She turns back to you. "Maybe I should start with who our father was. We didn't get to know him very well - he came home only occasionally. Don't get me wrong, our parents weren't fighting, but he had this passion: he couldn't stay in one place for very long. He was a captain, not unlike you, and he was restless to explore even the furthest parts of the galaxy. We believe he traveled further than most human captains; sometimes he brought small items back home that nobody could explain."`
	"CN-7536" `	She pauses for a moment. "Anyway, his testament says he left something behind for us on <planet>, in <system>. He said that he wouldn't make it easy though; he loved fantasy books, and there's always an air of mystery to those stories. He told us of a few systems we should visit before we go to Prime. It'll be like one last fantasy story from Dad!`
	"CN-7537" `	"Of course, it would be much easier if we could go directly to Prime, but we want to respect our father's last will." She looks directly at you now. "And that is why we need your help. Could you help us again and take us through all these systems?"`
	"CN-7538" `	"Which systems would we have to fly through?"`
	"CN-7539" `	"I'm sorry, but that sounds too complicated to me."`
	"CN-7540" `	Liam pulls a star map out of his bag. "These are the systems our father wants us to visit: <waypoints>. Those systems are spread far out around human space, but apparently they all have something unique to them. We've never really traveled beyond our home planet, so it'll be quite a big adventure for us! We can offer 50,000 credits. Does that sound good?"`
	"CN-7541" `	"Sounds good!"`
	"CN-7542" `	"Sorry, I won't be able to take you. Those systems are too far away from each other."`
	"CN-7543" `	"Great! We weren't expecting this trip, so we'll need to buy some supplies," Sophie says, "but as soon as you're ready we'll be on board."`
	"CN-7544" `	"Well, it looks like we'll need to find somebody else," Sophie says. They both thank you for bringing them this far and walk away.`
	"CN-7545" `The siblings are uncharacteristically quiet, perhaps in anticipation of finally arriving at their destination. It is only when you have all stepped out into Prime's spaceport that Sophie says, "Captain <last>, you've helped us immensely, and we can't thank you enough for bringing us all across the galaxy! But we have one last request. Both of us think that you should come with us to see what our father left behind. Do you want to see it?"`
	"CN-7546" `	"Now that we've come so far, sure."`
	"CN-7547" `	"I'm sorry, I've got to be somewhere else."`
	"CN-7548" `	Liam pulls out a map - not the starmap he had before, but a local map of Prime marked 'New Toulouse'. "Apparently our father bought a whole mountain on this planet, and he wants us to go there. It's to the west of us near the New Pyrenees, a little while away from the spaceport."`
	"CN-7549" `	"Sounds good. I'll follow your lead."`
	"CN-7550" `	"We could also have a look around here, and see why your father chose this planet."`
	"CN-7551" `	"You're right. I hadn't thought of that, surely there was a reason he picked here," Sophie says.`
	"CN-7552" `	All three of you walk around the spaceport district for some time. Coming into a giant plaza, you see one of the newest models from Betelgeuse, a Behemoth, on display in the center. The massive freighter with its many turret emplacements towers over even the plaza, an obvious showcase of Prime's leading shipbuilding industry.`
	"CN-7553" `	Liam's face brightens as if he just understood something. "I think our father chose this planet because he was always a fan of Betelgeuse ships. Before he went on his adventures he used to be a test pilot for the shipyard."`
	"CN-7554" `	Sophie nods. "Right! And once he was allowed to keep one of their experimental models as a gift for being one of their most productive pilots. Betelgeuse almost wouldn't let him go when he wanted to leave and explore the galaxy! But we're running out of time. Shall we go to the mountain now?"`
	"CN-7555" `	"We should take a shuttle. It'll be the fastest way."`
	"CN-7556" `	"Let's take the maglev, we should make it before it gets dark."`
	"CN-7557" `	After a short shuttlecraft flight on Prime's extensive and well-maintained shuttle service, you and the siblings arrive at a provincial city, where you can see a small mountain that stands alone against the rest of the landscape.`
	"CN-7558" `	You take a maglev from the spaceport and get a tour through some of the regions of Prime's mainland; on the way you pass through the fields of New Toulouse, where the majority of the local agricultural industry is located, and into the New Pyrenees hills. After an hour you and the siblings step off at a provincial city. Although Betelgeuse starts to recede behind the horizon, you can see a small mountain that stands alone against the rest of the landscape.`
	"CN-7559" `	Liam, with the help of the map, guides all of you to the base of the mountain, where you come across a flat wall embedded into a small cavern in its side. "There's a phrase our father left in the instructions: 'Edr- i fen,'" he explains, a little embarrassed at his inability to pronounce it. "I don't know what it means, but I'm certain it has something to do with one of these fantasy novels he used to read."`
	"CN-7560" `	"Sounds funny, but let's say it."`
	"CN-7561" `	"You've got a strange dad, but I like his sense of humor."`
	"CN-7562" `	Sophie counts to three, and then all of you shout out the phrase together.`
	"CN-7563" `	Suddenly, a bright blue line appears on the wall. For a second, a flash blinds you and there is a dim hissing noise, like the sound of rock being cut by a laser. As you look back, the line forms into a blue rectangle, the shape rapidly expanding down the wall. When it reaches the ground, the shape has become large enough to cover a human.`
	"CN-7564" `	For a moment, nothing happens, and the siblings are too stunned to do anything. The rectangle starts flashing between different hues of blue, until the whole section and the stone it covered disappears suddenly to leave behind a cavity in the wall. "I could have sworn the stone was real," Liam says under his breath.`
	"CN-7565" `	"Well, this is a real adventure. Let's go!"`
	"CN-7566" `	"We don't know what's inside there. Be careful."`
	"CN-7567" `	"Well, now that you mention it, I recently bought a small camera drone," Liam responds. "We can use it to scout out the hallway. It's only in infrared, so we won't see too many details," he adds. Liam starts the drone and guides it using a small remote control with integrated display. After some time, the drone flies back out and he tells you, "I think it is safe. We can go."`
	"CN-7568" `	In single file, the three of you enter the hallway behind the opening. Strangely, the stone walls are perfectly smooth, and the light that guides you through seems to come out of nowhere. "To use alien technology for something like this," Sophie laughs, "that's totally our dad."`
	"CN-7569" `	For a long while the three of you continue through the stone hallway, the light following your movements, until it opens up into a dome-shaped room brilliantly bathed in blue light. On the walls, there are all manner of alien artifacts lined up next to each other, but at the center of the room there is a pedestal with a sword inserted into it. A small tablet stands in a socket in front of it.`
	"CN-7570" `	(Go up to the sword.)`
	"CN-7571" `	(Take a look around first.)`
	"CN-7572" `	You walk around to the right of the dome to the collection of alien objects, all steel in color and rather blocky. "Wow, he must have always brought us back the small items from his expeditions, because these artifacts over here are huge!" Liam exclaims from another part of the dome. "How did he even move all these here?"`
	"CN-7573" `	Now that Liam points it out, many of the larger artifacts over his way look similar to the Sheragi technology you studied with Albert Foster.`
	"CN-7574" `	After some time, Sophie calls you both to come and look at the tablet.`
	"CN-7575" `	(Go over to Sophie.)`
	"CN-7576" `	A short message, written on the tablet in green ink, appears as you approach:`
	"CN-7577" `			"My dear children. The galaxy runs far and wide, and I have traveled many places, more than most in many lifetimes. I have seen many worlds, both alien and human, too. It was my life's work.`
	"CN-7578" `			"But still, there were many paths I did not take, many rocks I have left unturned, and many worlds I have not yet landed on. And I suspect that you will have read this before those destinations were reached. Well, I have arrived at a different destination now, the only one nobody can understand, but everybody reaches eventually. Do not fear for me.`
	"CN-7579" `			"This room you are in now is the culmination of all my work. I hope you understand that it was for your sake that I kept these a secret. My journey was long and unforgiving, but it was my life. I hope you continue that journey, to understand the universe a little better.`
	"CN-7580" `			"Your father."`
	"CN-7581" `	Understanding the personal nature of the message, you leave the two alone for a bit, walking around and looking at the artifacts on the left of the dome.`
	"CN-7582" `	After some time, the siblings call you back. Sophie says, "Captain <last>, Liam and I have thought about this, and we think that we would never be able to live up to our father's expectations if we kept this sword. We can study all these artifacts and understand more about the universe through them, but we cannot study this one. To understand its abilities, it needs to be used.`
	"CN-7583" `	"This sword was always at our father's side, and it has been many places. Take it to many more." She pulls the sword from the pedestal, and gives it one last look before handing over it to you. "It is yours now."`
	"CN-7584" `	"I would be more than grateful to accept it."`
	"CN-7585" `	"This is too much for me to take."`
	"CN-7586" `	"Are you sure?" Sophie asks. "This is a one time offer. It would be wasted on us."`
	"CN-7587" `	"Yes, I'm sure."`
	"CN-7588" `	"Well, if you frame it that way, I'll take it."`
	"CN-7589" `	You take the strange sword from Sophie. It seems abnormally light, but maybe that's because you've never held a sword before.`
	"CN-7590" `	"I see... please, if you won't take our father's sword, take an extra payment for having to put up with us all the way up until now." She takes the sword away and inserts it back into the pedestal.`
	"CN-7591" `	"Well, we'll need some time to take it all in and arrange things, find a place to stay on Prime and all that," Sophie says, "but we won't keep you from your ship any longer. It was a pleasure to travel with you, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-7592" `	Liam adds, "We will always be grateful for your help with our father's will. We never imagined that we would come so far, and we would have never done it without you. It means so much to us. We wish you well through the stars, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-7593" `	After Liam hands you a credit chip for <payment>, you say goodbye to the two siblings and leave them in their father's mysterious dome.`
	"CN-7594" `	After Liam hands you a few credit chips for <payment>, you say goodbye to the two siblings and leave them in their father's mysterious dome.`
	"CN-7595" `	"Well, that's okay. We'll always appreciate the help you've given us in fulfilling our father's will. Oh, and here's your payment, and a little extra for putting up with us all this time," Liam says, handing you a few credit chips for <payment>. "We wish you well through the stars!" Again, the siblings both thank you profusely for the trip, and you watch them leave Prime's spaceport with excitement.`
	"CN-7596" `With some trepidation, you give the shipyard owner your money and take your new ship for a test drive, piloting it out of the shipyard and onto a spare landing pad by the spaceport. Then you get out and look the ship over a bit more closely. You are busy polishing out a few rust spots with a piece of steel wool when an old man in grease-stained coveralls walks up.`
	"CN-7597" `	"Nothing quite like buying your very first starship," he says.`
	"CN-7598" `	"Yeah, I'm still kind of in shock over how much money I spent."`
	"CN-7599" `	"Well, I don't plan to get too attached to this one. I'll be flying something much nicer before long."`
	"CN-7600" `	"Beat it, old-timer, I've got more important things to do than chat with you."`
	"CN-7601" `	He grins. "I know the feeling. It's a crime how much interest the banks charge to first-timers. It's been that way ever since when I first started out."`
	"CN-7602" `	He smiles. "I'm sure you will. But there's something nice to having a ship you can pilot all by yourself. Believe me, once you have to start managing crew and paying salaries, or keeping track of a whole fleet, you'll miss these days when everything was simple."`
	"CN-7603" `	"You're a captain?" you ask.`
	"CN-7604" `	"Was," he says. "Sold off my fleet a few days ago, and I already miss it. But it was time. Time for me to retire." His voice trails off, then his face lights up. "Say, any chance I could hitch a ride with you, maybe show you the ropes, give you some pointers? I could pay you, of course."`
	"CN-7605" `	"Sure, where are you trying to get to?"`
	"CN-7606" `	"Sorry, I'd rather figure things out on my own."`
	"CN-7607" `	"Well," he says, "I've got a spot reserved in a retirement home, but I don't mind taking a roundabout way to get there. For starters, how about you give me a lift to <planet>? It's just one jump away from here; I can mark it on your map."`
	"CN-7608" `	"How much will you pay me?"`
	"CN-7609" `	"That's kind of a rude question," he says, "but I'll pay you ten thousand credits. I guarantee you that's more than any captain ever gets for carrying one passenger for one day."`
	"CN-7610" `	"That's really generous. Thank you."`
	"CN-7611" `	"You're treating me like a charity case? No thanks, I'll earn my money legitimately."`
	"CN-7612" `	"Great," he says. "My name is James, by the way."`
	"CN-7613" `	"<first> <last>," you say.`
	"CN-7614" `	"I'm looking forward to traveling with you, Captain <last>," says James.`
	"CN-7615" `	"<first> <last>?" he stops for a moment. "I've heard that name before. Reminds me of someone famous, I think," says James. "Anyways, I'm looking forward to traveling with you."`
	"CN-7616" `	As you're helping him wheel his luggage aboard and showing him his bunk, he says, "Before we take off, you might head on over to the trading center and stock up on medical goods; we can sell those for a good profit on <planet>. Also make sure to visit the local outfitter. While they don't sell much here compared to on the big manufacturing worlds, every world with an outfitter will at least carry a map with information on the neighboring systems. Buying them can help if you're not quite sure where you're going."`
	"CN-7617" `As you land on <planet>, James says, "Congrats on your first trip through hyperspace! I'm impressed that you didn't throw up; most folks do, the first time."`
	"CN-7618" `	"Including you?" you ask.`
	"CN-7619" `	"Yeah, and then spent half an hour in orbit cleaning my cabin while hoping the passengers wouldn't come out of their bunk room and see the mess. Not my proudest moment. Anyway, here's your pay." He hands you <payment>.`
	"CN-7620" `	Then he adds, "If you're okay with giving me a lift for a while longer, sell off any of that cargo you bought and then meet me in the spaceport. I'll see if I can rustle up any interesting work for you to do."`
	"CN-7621" `	(Click the "Spaceport" button to continue this mission.)`
	"CN-7622" `You begin strolling through the spaceport, walking briskly in order to keep warm and wondering if it might be worth investing in a good winter coat for visiting planets like this one. Eventually you find James. He has an entire family in tow: a young couple, an elderly woman, and four children who range in age from probably about three or four up to twelve or thirteen.`
	"CN-7623" `	"Captain <last>!" he says. "Wonderful to see you again. I was just talking to this family. They've been having trouble finding a single ship that can give them all passage, but I told them that your shuttlecraft has plenty of bunks, at least if the kids double up. They can pay you <payment> to take them to <planet>, which is just a few jumps away from Earth, and is a planet well worth visiting in its own right. What do you say?"`
	"CN-7624" `	You're absolutely sure that your shuttle was not designed to fit nine people including yourself, but if they're willing to squeeze into the available five bunks you've got no reason to discourage them.`
	"CN-7625" `	"Sure, welcome aboard!"`
	"CN-7626" `	"Sorry, I think I'd rather go off in my own direction from here."`
	"CN-7627" `	James helps the older woman up the steps and into your ship while the younger family members carry the luggage. You are going to have quite a full ship for the next few days.`
	"CN-7628" `Along the journey, you learned that the family you are transporting are named the Hendersons, and that they are moving to <planet> mostly because they hope the urban setting will be better for their kids than <origin>, where there were hardly any children at all and their village had only a few thousand people in it. The grandmother, Olivia, has also been chattering nonstop about how excited she is about being on a world where she can actually go sunbathing: "I've gotten much too old for snowshoeing," she says.`
	"CN-7629" `	You say goodbye to them and wish them well, and as agreed they pay you <payment>. You are already well on your way towards paying down your mortgage!`
	"CN-7630" `	As James leaves the ship, he says, "Again, if you're okay with continuing to give me a ride, just meet me in the spaceport."`
	"CN-7631" `	(As before, click the "Spaceport" button to continue this mission.)`
	"CN-7632" `It doesn't take you long to find James in the <origin> spaceport. He's already got a small group of people with him: a middle-aged couple, and a teenage boy. "Hi there, Captain <last>!" says James. "Interested in carrying some tourists to <planet>?"`
	"CN-7633" `	"No thanks, I think I'll strike off on my own now."`
	"CN-7634" `	"Great," he says. "This is Chuck, and Sarah, and their son Carl. Let's help them carry their luggage to your ship." As you begin walking back, slightly ahead of them, James whispers to you, "Tourists are always a good way to make money. They're on vacation, so they don't mind paying a bit extra. But no point in your cargo space going to waste, so take a look at the job board and see if there are any delivery missions we can run at the same time. And if you want to be a little safer should we come across any pirates, sell off any offensive weapons you might have. It might seem counterintuitive, but being unarmed makes you less of a target to pirates if there are others in the system that they could be defending themselves against."`
	"CN-7635" `As you make the final landing descent to the surface of Earth, Chuck and Sarah stare out the window in rapt attention, pointing out landmarks on the planet's surface. James joins in by telling you all about some of the history of the cities you are flying over. Carl, meanwhile, has spent the entire journey playing a handheld video game, and only glances out the window when the ship shakes from turbulence. As they all grab their luggage and step off your ship to explore humanity's homeworld, he is still immersed in the game.`
	"CN-7636" `	As you collect your payment, James pulls the parents aside and says, "Watch out for pickpockets, okay? And take it from an experienced captain, you do not want to be out after dark here. Play it safe, and have a great time."`
	"CN-7637" `	After they leave, James shakes his head ruefully. "It'll probably be a decade before that kid is old enough to realize what he's missing out on. Waste of money, doing a trip like this with a teenage boy. They should've gone to Skymoot and seen the dragons instead; I'm sure that would interest him a lot more than historical museums and ancient cities." Then, he picks up his luggage and adds, "Same deal as before. If you want to keep traveling together, meet me in the spaceport."`
	"CN-7638" `The spaceport on <origin> is so big and crowded that it takes a long time to find James. The sheer number of people here is almost overwhelming. Homeless men wrapped in old army blankets beg money from well-dressed businessmen. Soldiers in Navy uniforms walk by in groups of ten or twenty, all marching in unison. Starship captains haggle with merchants over trade goods and jobs. Flashes of light come from various landing bays as welders make repairs.`
	"CN-7639" `	When you find James, he's standing by a window, looking out at the city, watching the starships taking off and landing in a continuous stream. "This is it," he says, "where our race began. The world that all the tourists want to visit, and that no one wants to live on. Twenty billion people, more industry and exports than any other place in the galaxy. But underneath it all, poverty of a completely different sort from what you've got in the Dirt Belt."`
	"CN-7640" `	After taking one last glance out the window, he says, "Anyway, we're nearing my destination. Are you willing to take me on one last trip? I need to get to <destination>, and of course I'll pay you quite well to take me there."`
	"CN-7641" `	"Sorry, but I was planning on heading out in a different direction from here."`
	"CN-7642" `	Once again you walk back to your ship with James. Once you get there, as he's stowing his luggage, you pull up the information your computer has on <planet>. It's one of the "Paradise Worlds," terraformed to have a perfect climate, accessible only to the very wealthy. You wonder whether James is going to be able to fit in there.`
	"CN-7643" `The spaceport on <origin> is small enough that it doesn't take long to find James. He's talking with a man wearing what looks like a doctor's lab coat. "Captain <last>!" says James. "Glad you could join us. It turns out there's been a flu outbreak on <planet>, and they're asking every captain with space to spare to carry some vaccines and other medical supplies over there. Are you willing to help out?"`
	"CN-7644" `	"Sure, anything I can do to assist them!"`
	"CN-7645" `	"Sorry, I've heard bad things about that region of space. I think I'm going to head in the other direction."`
	"CN-7646" `	"Great!" says James. "They'll be loading up your ship shortly."`
	"CN-7647" `You drop off the shipment of <commodity> on <planet>, and collect your payment of <payment>. "Hauling freight," says James. "Not the most glamorous job, or the most interesting, but you're always guaranteed steady income. And once you know the galaxy a bit better, instead of taking missions you can find your own trade routes to follow. The only trouble is, build up a fleet with lots of cargo space and not enough defenses and the pirates begin to take notice."`
	"CN-7648" `	"Did you have a lot of trouble with pirates when you were a captain?"`
	"CN-7649" `	"But what if I want to earn money more quickly than I can by trading?"`
	"CN-7650" `	"Some. That's why you can't just go traipsing around the galaxy in a fleet of unarmed star barges; every pirate within a week's travel will hear you're coming through and come after you. In the long term, having a few heavy freighters with good defenses is more cost-effective than losing a star barge or two to the pirates on every journey."`
	"CN-7651" `	"There's no quick road to riches, kid. The more something pays, the riskier it is. If you need to make lots of money in a hurry, bounty hunting is the way to go, but nine out of ten pilots who give bounty hunting a try end up dead. And, no one's going to give you those sorts of missions until you've proved yourself in combat, anyway."`
	"CN-7652" `	He picks up his suitcase. "If you want to run another mission with me, look for me in the spaceport. I'll see if I can find you something with a bit higher profit margin this time."`
	"CN-7653" `As you walk through the spaceport, James sees you from a distance and waves you over. As you approach, the smell of raw fish overwhelms you. "I've found another job for you," he says.`
	"CN-7654" `	"Is it by any chance an unusually smelly job?"`
	"CN-7655" `	"Sorry, I think I'll head off on my own now."`
	"CN-7656" `	"It is indeed," he says, "but a lucrative one. <cargo> needs to get to <planet> while it's still fresh, and that means it needs to be there no later than <day>. If we take a direct route, there should be no trouble making the delivery on time. What do you say?"`
	"CN-7657" `	"Sounds good. Let's do it!"`
	"CN-7658" `	"Sorry, no way am I loading up my shiny new starship with smelly fish."`
	"CN-7659" `	"Great!" he says. "I mentioned this earlier, but you might want to stop by the outfitter and buy a local map. Hyperspace routes aren't always logical, and the last thing you want to do is get lost and end up with a pile of rotten fish that no one wants filling up your cargo hold."`
	"CN-7660" `By now, your entire ship smells like brine and raw fish, but as best you can tell the fish is still fresh enough to eat. The dock workers on <planet> offload it without comment, and give you your payment of <payment>.`
	"CN-7661" `	"If you can line them up right," says James, "rush deliveries can be your best source of income as a freighter captain. And keep your eye out for missions with large amounts of cargo, too, because your barge's hold is definitely big enough to handle them. And if you've got any cargo space to spare and you know what the prices are going to be at your destination, be sure to stock up on something you can sell for a profit."`
	"CN-7662" `	"What would you recommend if I want to do more than just carry cargo?"`
	"CN-7663" `	"Was that what you did for your whole career?"`
	"CN-7664" `	He pauses for a moment to think, then says, "Unless you want to do something really risky like hunting pirates, your best bet is to work with the Navy, or the Syndicate, or one of the local militias. Any of those would be a decent choice, although they've each got their own problems. If any of them offer you a mission, go ahead and take it; that's a good way to build connections and get to know the lay of the land."`
	"CN-7665" `	"Well," he says, "Back when I was a bit older than you, I piloted a Firebird for a while, escorting merchant convoys up and down the Rim. I used to hope we'd get attacked; I'd disable the pirate ships and rob them blind. Turnabout is fair play, after all.`
	"CN-7666" `	"Then one day I got a bit too greedy and thought I'd try to capture a pirate ship or two, to add more firepower to my fleet. We boarded their ship, and I sent my crew through the airlock to kill off the pirates. And it turns out the pirates had grenades. Four of my men were dead before I even realized what was happening. We had to retreat, and then limp back to port without even enough crew left uninjured to pilot the ship right. After that I decided to stick to less risky jobs."`
	"CN-7667" `	He glances toward the spaceport and says, "Anyway, if you want to make one more trip with me, you know where to find me."`
	"CN-7668" `You find James talking with a group of miners, who seem to be old acquaintances of his. As you approach, he says, "Well guys, here comes my ride. I should probably say goodbye." They head back off to do their work. "Every time I land here," says James, "I'm amazed that this station hasn't been wiped out yet by a meteorite. Can you imagine spending your life here?"`
	"CN-7669" `	"It does seem awfully isolated. But some people might enjoy the solitude."`
	"CN-7670" `	"Well, if you need the money, at least it's a steady job."`
	"CN-7671" `	"I suppose," he says. "Anyway, I think it's time for the last leg of my journey. Do you think you can give me a lift to <planet>? I'll pay you quite well for your services, of course."`
	"CN-7672" `	"Sure, I can take you there."`
	"CN-7673" `	"Sorry, I was thinking of heading in a different direction from here."`
	"CN-7674" `You find James standing on a landing pad underneath a large freighter, chatting with a man you assume is the captain. "There you are!" he says. "Captain Eldred here says his two ships have been having trouble with pirates ever since they left the Rim ten days ago, and he's looking for an escort to get them safely to Gemstone. Are you interested?"`
	"CN-7675" `	"Of course!"`
	"CN-7676" `	"No, sounds a bit too risky for me."`
	"CN-7677" `	"Great," he says. "Whenever we're ready to leave the planet, they'll take off behind us and follow us to <planet>." As you begin walking away together, he adds in a quieter voice, "Normally a fresh pilot like you with no combat reputation would never be offered a mission like this, so try not to mess things up. Remember that we don't have to kill the pirates, all we have to do is make sure the convoy isn't destroyed. But freighters are slow, so you can't just go skipping through hyperspace as fast as you want; you need to stick around and make sure they're behind you."`
	"CN-7678" `The captain of the Horn of Plenty hands you <payment> and thanks you for your escort services. From the expression on his face, you'd guess that he's feeling lucky to still be alive after entrusting the safety of his fleet to a rookie pilot like yourself.`
	"CN-7679" `	After he is gone, James turns to you and says, "Not too bad for your first escort mission. I recognize that look on your face - it's the same one I had after my first job like this back when I was a beginner. If I recall, my first priority after touching down was replacing some of the ship's guns with missile launchers so I'd actually have a chance against pirates. It's a scandal how they sell interceptors with nothing but short-ranged energy weapons these days; trying to use them in combat on such a small ship is practically suicide. Keep your distance with some missiles and you can almost never go wrong. Anyway, I'll stop rambling. If you've still got a hankering for some dangerous missions, come and find me in the spaceport before you leave." He picks up his suitcase and heads outside.`
	"CN-7680" `	(As before, click the "Spaceport" button to continue this mission. The next mission will involve carrying cargo, so it will only show up if you have all 15 tons of space free.)`
	"CN-7681" `You find James in the spaceport bar, talking with a woman wearing a business suit. The expression on James' face is growing increasingly concerned as she speaks. Seeing you come in, he waves to you and you join them at the table.`
	"CN-7682" `	"Hello <first>," says James. "This is Marissa, a senior manager at the mines." You shake hands with her.`
	"CN-7683" `	"Here's the deal," says Marissa. "Most of the gemstones we mine here are industrial grade, not pretty enough to be worth using as anything but sandpaper grit or drill bits. But every once in a while we happen on some higher quality gems. No one in this sector has the money to spend on jewelry, so we ship them north to the Paradise Worlds.`
	"CN-7684" `	"But in the past few months, every shipment we've sent has been attacked by a pirate ship, the Hammer of Thor. We don't have the money to pay a bounty hunter to take out the Hammer, so instead we're going to pay you to outrun it. Is the <ship> a fast ship?"`
	"CN-7685" `	"As fast as they come. Nothing bigger than a fighter could chase it down."`
	"CN-7686" `	"Not fast enough. I don't think I can risk taking on this mission."`
	"CN-7687" `	"Great," she says. "My people will load up your ship immediately. Good luck, Captain."`
	"CN-7688" `	After she leaves, James says to you, "Now, get one thing clear. This is not your David and Goliath moment. The Hammer's shields are ten times as strong as yours, and if it's able to bring its weapons to bear, we'll be dead in two seconds. So, the moment we're in the sky, we head straight for hyperspace. Don't even wait around to see if the Hammer is coming or not. Got it?"`
	"CN-7689" `	"I really shouldn't try to fight?"`
	"CN-7690" `	"It just isn't feasible," he says. "If a ship has turrets, your Sparrow can't get close enough to hit it with your guns without being damaged, and then it's just a matter of whose weapons and shields are stronger. And two Heavy Rocket hits could nearly disable you. Also, if it has anti-missile turrets, you can't count on hanging back and bombarding it with missiles from long distances, or at least not with weapons that can fit in a Sparrow. So, don't risk it. It's like rock paper scissors; recognize what your enemy's strengths and weaknesses are, as well as your own."`
	"CN-7691" `As you land on Ingot, James says, "Well, you made it in one piece! Still think you want to be piloting an interceptor?"`
	"CN-7692" `	"Sure, but I can't wait until I've got a ship big enough to stand up to pirates instead of running from them."`
	"CN-7693" `	"Well, maybe I should've bought a freighter instead."`
	"CN-7694" `	"Better start saving up then," he says. "I know a number of old Sparrow pilots who made their first million credits mining asteroids before they could afford a more combat-worthy ship. They had to look around for a while before finding a system with any asteroids worth mining, but it was worth it. Anyway, let's go get your payment." You walk out of the ship and sign the papers to hand off the <commodity> to the dock workers on <planet>. They hand you a credit chip worth <payment>.`
	"CN-7695" `	"I've got an idea for something you might want to try," says James. "Meet me in the spaceport bar in a little while."`
	"CN-7696" `You find James waiting for you just outside the spaceport bar. Against the steady patter of micrometeorites against the roof he tells you, "Working here on <origin> is one of the few jobs in the galaxy more dangerous than fighting pirates. And worse, because if a big meteorite decides to strike this station, there's basically nothing the miners can do about it except hope they see it coming." He turns to you with a grin. "But nonetheless, I think you might be interested in this idea."`
	"CN-7697" `	James leads you down the side of the bar to a booth where a man with a half-eaten hamburger and a plate of fries is sitting, busily examining a star map of the local sector. He notices your arrival and stands up to greet you. "<first>, this is Captain Marshall," James says as you shake his hand. "I told him about your new ship and how it'd be a good idea for you to get a taste of asteroid mining. He mines in this part of space and says there's a good system nearby if you're willing to give it a try."`
	"CN-7698" `	"I'll give it a shot."`
	"CN-7699" `	"I think I'm ready to head out on my own."`
	"CN-7700" `	"That's good to hear," Captain Marshall says with a smile. "But be warned that mining isn't as easy as one might think. Especially without an asteroid scanner, mining can be just as much a test of your piloting skills as combat.`
	"CN-7701" `	"The first challenge," he continues, "will be finding which asteroids are valuable. The worthless asteroids are either brown and smooth or gray and spiky with no apparent orbit. It doesn't matter how long you shoot them, they won't be destroyed. Valuable asteroids will always orbit the star and have a range of colors and surface textures. If you're not sure which are which and you don't have an asteroid scanner to tell you, keep a look out for other miners to see what they're firing at.`
	"CN-7702" `	"Generally speaking, the more valuable minerals are tougher to mine, either because they're harder to break apart, or they're less common and in more dangerous regions of the galaxy. Silicon breaks up quickly; you'll fill your hold in a hurry and the stuff is everywhere. Platinum or gold asteroids are more work; they're not as common in areas where the Navy watches your back, but you make several times the number of credits for the effort.`
	"CN-7703" `	"I could go on, but I think you get the picture."`
	"CN-7704" `	You and James chat with Marshall a while longer, and he suggests trying your hand at mining in <system>. "It's a great place. You could throw a dart in that system and half the time you'd hit an asteroid worth at least something, and I've never been bothered by pirates while I've been there."`
	"CN-7705" `	"That does sound like a good place for a beginner pilot," James says. "How about we start small, <first>? Let's go mine at least five tons of silicon before landing on <planet> and we can call it a day."`
	"CN-7706" `Once you've landed, you meet up with James and he asks you, "What did you think of mining?"`
	"CN-7707" `	"I can't believe anyone would do that much work."`
	"CN-7708" `	"I love flying like that."`
	"CN-7709" `	James nods and says, "Chasing asteroids can be a challenge, but when you're starting off, mining can be a fast way to build cash for your next ship. It's also a great way to explore the galaxy. Jobs always follow the trade routes and settled areas. Mining makes it profitable to explore the nooks and crannies of the hyperlanes. If the place you end up landing has an economy, they'll buy the minerals in your hold. Mainly though, it's about how you like to spend your time. Some captains like managing a trading fleet while others like to strike out on their own.`
	"CN-7710" `	"Mining can be complex compared to running jobs or trading commodities. I learned that first hand after pirates disabled my ship when I was starting out and I worked aboard a mining ship while it was being repaired. Now that was a while back so I might be a little rusty, but I could try at answering any other questions you might have about mining."`
	"CN-7711" `	"What equipment do I need to mine?"`
	"CN-7712" `	"How do you deal with pirates?"`
	"CN-7713" `	"How can I check the value of minerals?"`
	"CN-7714" `	"I think I have enough information."`
	"CN-7715" `	"Well, you need a weapon that does hull damage," James says. "A Beam Laser will get the job done, but it will take a while. If you want to optimize your mining operations, however, you'll want a Mining Laser. Not only does it cut through asteroids faster, it's also more precise and preserves more minerals when the asteroid breaks apart. Some miners like to have a bit of combat flexibility by mining with Heavy Lasers, however.`
	"CN-7716" `	"Aside from lasers, the most valuable tool is an asteroid scanner. They're expensive, but they connect into your navigation and targeting systems to point you towards minable asteroids. You can also set them to find the most valuable asteroids, which increases your profitability per run. After that, a tactical scanner will tell you how far away the asteroid is and show how much damage you're doing. An afterburner is good for chasing down fast moving asteroids or getting away from pirates without leaving the system. A ramscoop will let you refuel while mining, extend your exploration range, and allow you to be ready for a quick escape."`
	"CN-7717" `	"I can't fit all that on my ship!"`
	"CN-7718" `	"That all makes sense."`
	"CN-7719" `	James gives you a knowing smile as he answers, "Not in a factory build, you won't. But you'd be surprised how much space you can free up even in a Sparrow if you're willing to be flexible. Do you really need that much power? If you've got an outfitter on the planet where you're mining, do you need a hyperdrive, or even a shield generator? Maybe a cargo expansion would be of more use." He pauses briefly, perhaps considering what liability he's opened himself up for, then adds, "I'm not saying you should, of course, but you have options.`
	"CN-7720" `	"You can always bribe them to leave you alone. If the minerals are good enough and you have enough cargo capacity, you'll still turn a profit. Or if you have a fast ship, you can just run away. Of course, with enough of a fleet you just fight them off." He shakes his head. "Most pirates would be richer and live longer if they just mined instead of extorting merchants and plundering ships.`
	"CN-7721" `	"You will learn this by experience, but if the planet has an outfitter, you can check the price there before you sell.`
	"CN-7722" `	"Anything else you want to ask me?"`
	"CN-7723" `	"If you're willing to take me on one more journey," James says, "meet me in the spaceport bar in a little while. Don't forget to sell off your minerals at the trading post, or if there is one, the outfitter."`
	"CN-7724" `You find James sitting at the spaceport's tiny bar, sipping a beer while watching the large displays that show the landing pads and the irrigated fields beyond. The displays are supposed to make the underground building feel less claustrophobic.`
	"CN-7725" `	"This is one of the least habitable planets in the galaxy. But if it doesn't kill us instantly, then someone's tried to settle it." He pauses for a moment while gazing at one of the displays. You spot a sandstorm picking up in the far distance as the workers in the fields hastily finish their work before it arrives.`
	"CN-7726" `	"Care for a drink?" he asks.`
	"CN-7727" `	He buys you a beer. It tastes a little stale, but it's not the worst beer you've ever had. You can't help but feel sorry for the people who work here, so isolated and cut off from even the basic amenities you took for granted on <starting planet>.`
	"CN-7728" `	"Anyway," says James, "would you be willing to take me on one more journey? It's time for me to head for that retirement home."`
	"CN-7729" `	"Sorry, I think I'll go hunt some pirates instead."`
	"CN-7730" `	As you are piloting your ship down to land on <planet>, James disappears into his bunk room. After the ship has landed he comes out, no longer in the grease-stained coveralls he's been wearing up until now, but in a suit. As a lifelong textile worker, you automatically note that the suit is made of real wool, very finely woven, and that it has been tailored to fit him. He smooths down the front of the suit distractedly and then looks at his hands as if unsure of where to put them. "How do I look?" he asks.`
	"CN-7731" `	"Like a millionaire."`
	"CN-7732" `	"You look great."`
	"CN-7733" `	"Well, that's the other thing about being a captain," he says. "You can get filthy rich."`
	"CN-7734" `	"Let's hope the locals think so," he says.`
	"CN-7735" `	There's an awkward pause. You're unsure of how to respond. Then he says, "Thing is, this here planet is one of the most exclusive retirement communities in the galaxy. Plenty of the locals are probably worth more than a billion credits. But they're mostly financial or business types, or old money. I'm rich enough to be here, but I just hope they're willing to socialize with someone who made his fortune flying a ship.`
	"CN-7736" `	"Before you go, is there anything else you'd like to ask me about being a new pilot?"`
	"CN-7737" `	"Where should I go if I want to avoid pirates?"`
	"CN-7738" `	"Have you ever met any aliens?"`
	"CN-7739" `	"Are there any good trade routes you can give me?"`
	"CN-7740" `	"Where can I find well-paying jobs?"`
	"CN-7741" `	"I think I'll manage."`
	"CN-7742" `	"Stay near Sol and around the Paradise Worlds. The Navy stays there the most, so even if a pirate does show up, they won't last long. The Deep is also a pretty safe place, as they have their own security forces. Once you start moving farther south, things get riskier. The worlds down there don't bring in as much tax revenue as the Paradise Worlds do, so the Navy tends to ignore them. You'll find some local militia to back you up, but they're nothing compared to one of the Navy's Cruisers.`
	"CN-7743" `	"I've spoken with the Quarg a few times, but what captain hasn't? You'll find them down south by Tarazed. I haven't met any other aliens," he pauses for a moment, "as far as I'm aware, that is, but I'm sure they're out there if you go looking hard enough. I've explored all of Republic space in my many years, but there are far more systems out there that we don't even know how to reach.`
	"CN-7744" `	"One of the most reliable trade routes is to bring food from the Dirt Belt to Earth or the other urban worlds around it. There are billions of mouths to feed on those worlds, and the Dirt Belt sells food for cheap, so it's a great place to get started. Just remember though that if you use the same trade route for too long, you might end up causing the prices to stabilize. The Dirt Belt can only produce food and people can only eat it so fast, so change up your trade routes if you notice the return getting worse.`
	"CN-7745" `	"Getting good jobs is more about having the space to accept the good jobs than it is finding them, but if you're looking for jobs that pay well for little effort, then you'll want to watch out around the holidays. There's always a big celebration on Earth every April 22nd, Earth Day, so pay attention to the job board in the months leading up to that. The people down in the Rim have some month-long celebration every August that you should look out for too.`
	"CN-7746" `	He hands you a credit chip worth <payment>, and says, "Best of luck to you, Captain. Don't hesitate to look me up if you're ever in the area. And remember to check the spaceports wherever you land. You never know who you'll find wandering around there."`
	"CN-7747" `Suddenly you hear raised voices and shouting outside: "We are under attack! <planet> is under attack by pirates! We need every combat-worthy ship to join the defenses!" The authorities will probably pay you quite well if you assist them, but this could also be an easy way to get yourself killed.`
	"CN-7748" `	(Stay here until the fight is over.)`
	"CN-7749" `A few militia pilots have gathered to help repel the pirate attack. You join them, and take off together...`
	"CN-7750" `The local Navy garrison is preparing to repel the pirate attack. You join them, and take off together...`
	"CN-7751" `The local Syndicate defense forces are preparing to repel the pirate attack. You join them, and take off together...`
	"CN-7752" `Suddenly you hear raised voices and shouting outside: "We are under attack! <planet> is under attack by alien raiders! We need every combat-worthy ship to join the defenses!" The authorities will probably pay you quite well if you assist them, but this could also be an easy way to get yourself killed.`
	"CN-7753" `The local Syndicate defense forces are preparing to repel the alien attack. You join them, and take off together...`
	"CN-7754" `As you are visiting one of the spaceport bars, a man recognizes you. "<first> <last>!" he says. "It's an honor to meet you. Your exploits in battle are well known." He picks up his drink and walks over to sit next to you. "My name is Charles Atinoda," he says, "the chief starship designer for Tarazed Corporation. Say, would you be willing to help us test out a new warship?"`
	"CN-7755" `	"Sorry, I don't have time right now."`
	"CN-7756" `	"Well," he says, "here's the story. Seven years ago, in a time of deep personal crisis, I left my job at Tarazed to wander the galaxy with nothing in my backpack but a change of clothes, a canteen of water, and a few boxes of emergency rations. An anarchist commune on one of the fringe worlds took me in. After I had been there for a month, the village elder, sensing my inner turmoil, invited me to a vision quest in their sweat lodge. I fell into a trance and my consciousness journeyed through many universes, where I saw strange things. I saw a sword made of light. I saw a blue sun. I saw..." He pauses for a moment. "... a Welsh Corgi hacking into a computer? Some of it was hard to understand."`
	"CN-7757" `	"Fascinating."`
	"CN-7758" `	"Were there illicit substances involved in this vision quest?"`
	"CN-7759" `	He ignores your question. "But then I saw one more thing," he says.`
	"CN-7760" `	"But then I saw one more thing," he says.`
	"CN-7761" `	He is silent for a long moment, then says, "I saw a dark ship, more graceful and elegant than any I had ever designed, battling an alien vessel with a mottled red hull. And when I saw that ship, I knew that I must build one like it. I hitched a ride back to Wayfarer, begged for my old job back, and got to work. Seven years later, the ship is nearly done. It has passed all our non-destructive testing with flying colors, which leaves only the combat test remaining. And who better to battle it than the renowned warrior, <first> <last>?"`
	"CN-7762" `	"I would be glad to."`
	"CN-7763" `	"What will I receive in return?"`
	"CN-7764" `	"A generous payment," he says, "and the right to purchase one of the very first units off the production line, if you wish."`
	"CN-7765" `	"Sounds fair," you say.`
	"CN-7766" `	"Excellent," he says. "I'll need your signature on a few forms. Waivers of liability in case you die, permission to use your name and likeness in certain promotional materials. You know, the usual legal stuff."`
	"CN-7767" `	"No problem. Where will I battle this ship?"`
	"CN-7768" `	"Sorry, I don't think I can agree to that."`
	"CN-7769" `	"We do most of our starship testing in the <waypoints> system," he says. "The test ship is unmistakable. Journey there, disable it without destroying it, then return here and we'll ask you about any weaknesses you found or improvements you would make. And if you destroy the ship or steal it, naturally you will forfeit your payment."`
	"CN-7770" `Atinoda meets up with you soon after you land. "I see that you survived," he says. "Was it a difficult fight?"`
	"CN-7771" `	"Yes, you have built an impressive ship."`
	"CN-7772" `	"No, I'm afraid I made short work of it."`
	"CN-7773" `	"Glad to hear it," he says. "Now, we have the opportunity to make a few tweaks before we start mass-producing this ship. What changes would you recommend?"`
	"CN-7774" `	"Oh well," he says, "you are the infamous <first> <last>, after all, so I suppose any single warship will be little threat to you. Now, we have the opportunity to make a few tweaks before we start mass-producing this ship. What changes would you recommend?"`
	"CN-7775" `	"Lots of weapon space is always my first priority."`
	"CN-7776" `	"You should make sure it has enough space for any engine."`
	"CN-7777" `	"Maybe you should work on improving the shields and hull."`
	"CN-7778" `	"I feel like such a large ship should have more bays for fighters."`
	"CN-7779" `	"Very well," he says, "we'll see if we can expand the weapon capacity so that even the biggest weapons will fit."`
	"CN-7780" `	"Very well," he says, "we'll see if we can expand the engine capacity enough that even the biggest engines will fit."`
	"CN-7781" `	"Okay," he says, "we'll focus on strengthening the hull and the shield matrix."`
	"CN-7782" `	"Very well," he says, "we'll see if we can incorporate more fighter bays into the hull."`
	"CN-7783" `	"Does the ship model have a name yet?" you ask.`
	"CN-7784" `	"Not yet," he says. "Do you have a suggestion?"`
	"CN-7785" `	"The Wraith."`
	"CN-7786" `	"The Grey Goose."`
	"CN-7787" `	"Not a bad name, I suppose," he says, "but at Tarazed we usually name our ships after animals. Any other ideas?"`
	"CN-7788" `	"The Dire Wolf."`
	"CN-7789" `	"The Kestrel."`
	"CN-7790" `	"I suppose it does sort of look like a goose in flight," he says, "but that's hardly an intimidating name. Do you have any scarier ideas?"`
	"CN-7791" `	"The Reaper."`
	"CN-7792" `	"Not bad," he says, "but all our other ships - the Falcon, the Osprey, the Hawk - they're all birds. Maybe a bird name?"`
	"CN-7793" `	"I don't know," he says, "that sounds a little bit over the top. Any other suggestions?"`
	"CN-7794" `	When you say the word 'Kestrel' he jerks as if he's just been electrocuted. "Yes," he says, "that's it! That's the name we'll go with. Thank you, Captain. I will let you know as soon as the Kestrel is available for sale, and we will take your recommendations into account when making our final modifications to the design." He pays you two million credits and wishes you the best of luck in your future endeavors.`
	"CN-7795" `You receive a message from Charles Atinoda, the ship designer at Tarazed Corporation: "Captain <last>, we are pleased to inform you that our latest warship is now available for sale here on Wayfarer. We've taken all your feedback into account in the final design. Thank you again!"`

	"CN-7824" `As you leave your ship, you see a crowd watching a video screen not far from your landing spot. The video jumps between a panel discussion and footage of Admiral Danforth being quizzed by Parliament. It has finished by the time you arrive, and many of the onlookers have already left for their business. Two captains remain, however, and, by the sounds of it, they're having a passionate discussion about the video.`
	"CN-7825" `	"Hey. What was that video about?"`
	"CN-7826" `	You're startled when the two captains turn to you, twin men with preposterous sideburns and rat-like mustaches. It's impossible to tell if they're smiling or frowning, as the pair live squarely in the middle of the uncanny valley.`
	"CN-7827" `	The left twin asks, "Can you believe this? It's been weeks and everyone's still obsessing over the Pug invasion. The news was all experts and officials at first, but now we just see talking heads and conspiracy theorists."`
	"CN-7828" `	In disbelief, the right twin responds, "It's just a propaganda exercise to boost Syndicate sales. Even if these elusive 'Pug' existed, we won't hear the end of it as long as the story boosts public opinion of the Syndicate."`
	"CN-7829" `	"It was possibly the biggest event this century. Of course people are going to keep talking about it."`
	"CN-7830" `	"Oh, the Pug were real alright. I met some and fought them."`
	"CN-7831" `	"I think you both need to shave."`
	"CN-7832" `	One twin rolls his eyes while the other twitches his mustache awkwardly. He rewinds the video to the Parliamentary discussion, where Danforth is reassuring councilors about the Navy's ability to patrol the fringes of human space.`
	"CN-7833" `	The left twin says, "Look at this bozo! Bounty's Councilor Maduena Kabiru, he keeps ranting against this Navy guy, uh, this Admiral..." He snaps his fingers trying to remember the name.`
	"CN-7834" `	"Admiral Danforth," says the right twin.`
	"CN-7835" `	"Right. Danforth. This councilor wants Danforth to defend against 'unknown dangers at the fringes of human space.' Don't we have enough immediate problems without imagining new horrors?"`
	"CN-7836" `	"Like terrorists nuking us," says the right twin.`
	"CN-7837" `	"The Navy is skilled and honorable. I trust them to protect us."`
	"CN-7838" `	"No, don't worry about that. I ended the bomb threat."`
	"CN-7839" `	"Maybe you're right."`
	"CN-7840" `	"All we can do is get on with our lives, right?"`
	"CN-7841" `	"If you don't shave soon, people will think you're wearing masks."`
	"CN-7842" `	Both of them give hard belly laughs, sending waves through their mustaches from the breeze of their breath.`
	"CN-7843" `	The left twin says, "Who are you, Admiral Danforts?"`
	"CN-7844" `	His twin corrects him. "Danforth. Admiral Danforth. Did the Navy fire you or are you here on holiday?"`
	"CN-7845" `	"Have you been under a rock the whole war? I'm Captain <first> <last>!"`
	"CN-7846" `	"Never mind."`
	"CN-7847" `	"At least I don't have a disheveled hamster stuck to my upper lip."`
	"CN-7848" `	Both twins look confused, and the left one responds. "We've been mining asteroids the whole war. The war was a big deal, but most of us had to keep living our lives. Do you think we have time to keep track of every warring captain?"`
	"CN-7849" `	The right one says apologetically, "Thank you for your service, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-7850" `	They both give clumsy but well-intentioned salutes and return to their ships.`
	"CN-7851" `	The left twin laughs and says, "Pardon us if we keep our eyes open and trust to our own guns." Both twins nod and depart to their ships.`
	"CN-7852" `	Both twins shrug and leave for their ships.`
	"CN-7853" `	Both twins' faces twist in a way that might indicate embarrassment or annoyance. It's hard to tell since their facial hair is halting any emotive power. They walk away in the direction of their ships.`
	"CN-7854" `You are relaxing in a cafe while your ship refuels, and a pair of middle-aged captains come to your table. One is Navy, the other is Free Worlds, and they bear a striking resemblance to each other.`
	"CN-7855" `	"Captain Rain, R.N.S. Camuy," says one. "How's the <ship>, Captain <last>?"`
	"CN-7856" `	"Captain Fiona, F.S. Baobab," says the other. "We both saw you in battle against the Pug. You're the war's most accomplished captain!`
	"CN-7857" `	"We've been patrolling together and we saw your ship, so we've come to say hi."`
	"CN-7858" `	"Why are Navy and Free Worlds captains traveling together?"`
	"CN-7859" `	"Have you found any new aliens?"`
	"CN-7860" `	"Did you fight on the other side of the war from each other?"`
	"CN-7861" `	"You were on opposite sides as sisters!?"`
	"CN-7862" `	"It was good meeting you both, but I must get back to my business now."`
	"CN-7863" `	"Hello. Sorry, but I don't have much time to talk."`
	"CN-7864" `	"Oh, we should've guessed you were too busy to chat," says Captain Rain.`
	"CN-7865" `	"The war might be over, but I'm sure there's still plenty of work for a captain such as yourself to do," says Captain Fiona. "Well it was at least nice to meet you. Stay well."`
	"CN-7866" `	"Joint police operation," says Captain Rain. "It's more common than you may think."`
	"CN-7867" `	Captain Fiona nods. "We're shutting down a galactic Spider Funk smuggling operation. It's an illegal hallucinogenic. Not addictive, but still dangerous. The organization running it is huge, well funded, and well armed."`
	"CN-7868" `	"Not a match for a Dreadnought and an Auxiliary, though," brags Rain.`
	"CN-7869" `	"We have to fly all over Republic and Free Worlds space, so we have a joint patrol with one ship from each state."`
	"CN-7870" `	"Of course, we have another mission," says Fiona. "Everywhere we go, we look out for new alien activity."`
	"CN-7871" `	"Only the usual assortment of hoaxes," says Rain. They both laugh at this.`
	"CN-7872" `	"Seriously, though, both the Free Worlds Senate and Republic Parliament are up in arms over fear of aliens," says Fiona. Rain adds, "Only metaphorically up in arms, this time.`
	"CN-7873" `	"If we find new aliens, we'll let the necessary authorities know as soon as possible. You should do the same. Be discreet, avoid conflicts, and seek help if you need it."`
	"CN-7874" `	"Yup," Fiona says, "being my sister didn't stop me blowing up her Cruiser! We rescued her ship's escape pods, though; they were veering concerningly towards a star."`
	"CN-7875" `	Rain continues, "Can you imagine my surprise when I woke up on my sister's new Dreadnought?"`
	"CN-7876" `	"Hey, you got a new Auxiliary commission afterwards," replies Fiona, poking Rain as she says it, "and your whole crew survived. Now we escort each other's ships during investigations!"`
	"CN-7877" `	"Well, Rain went off to Earth to join the Navy Academy years ago," says Captain Fiona.`
	"CN-7878" `	"And Fiona stayed on Longjump and joined the local militia before the Free Worlds were formed," says Captain Rain. "It's not that we wanted to fight each other, but we both believed in our own sides."`
	"CN-7879" `When you exit the landing area, you hear sounds of fists falling on skin and a kid yelling for help. Around the corner are three scruffy-looking boys hitting a fourth, who just fell on the ground. It's not clear if they're going to stop attacking him.`
	"CN-7880" `	"Break it up, kids."`
	"CN-7881" `	(Ignore them and keep walking.)`
	"CN-7882" `	The three attackers turn around, looking furious. They eye the gun in your holster and run away.`
	"CN-7883" `	The boy on the ground slowly rises to his feet. He looks about twelve years old. It takes him a few seconds to recover. "Thanks. Not a lot of people around here would help like that. I'm Gus." He looks worried and asks, "Can you walk me to the repair shop? I'm already late for work, and I'm afraid they'll attack me again."`
	"CN-7884" `	"Why were those boys attacking you?"`
	"CN-7885" `	"Aren't you a little young to work in a repair shop?"`
	"CN-7886" `	"I'm in a hurry. You're on your own."`
	"CN-7887" `	"My brother is a private, third class, in the Syndicate's Ancillary Security Service." He grins proudly, clearly having practiced that delivery. "He monitors the Syndicate workplaces and he turned those boys in for smoking on the job last week. I guess they finally got a break for the repair shop and came after me since they can't hurt my brother."`
	"CN-7888" `	As you start walking, he answers. "No, I'm an orphan." He sees your confusion and explains. "The Syndicate lets some of us orphans work in industry. In return they give us better schooling, nicer housing, and doctor's visits." He puffs himself up. "Only the cleverest of us get to do it. All of the jobs for orphans are safe too; we don't use big dangerous equipment. Just ordinary stuff, like hammers, soldering irons, or sewing machines.`
	"CN-7889" `	"Wait a minute!" He suddenly looks at you with wide eyes. "You're a captain, right? Were you in the big fights? I was on Maker when I saw some Pug ships fighting our ships on our school's big edu-screen."`
	"CN-7890" `	"Yes, I'm Captain <first> <last>."`
	"CN-7891" `	"I blew up my share of Pug ships."`
	"CN-7892" `	"Actually, I led the battle."`
	"CN-7893" `	"Oh, hold on," he says, pulling out a durable-looking data pad labeled "Syndicate Childcare Device." After some typing and swiping, he declares, "You're Captain <first> <last>! Wow! It's an honor to meet you. Can I shake your hand?" He puts out his hand, and you shake it.`
	"CN-7894" `	"Oh, hold on," he says, pulling out a durable-looking data pad labeled "Syndicate Childcare Device." After some typing and swiping, he declares, "You led the attack! Wow! It's an honor to meet you. Can I shake your hand?" He puts out his hand, and you shake it.`
	"CN-7895" `	"I bet you did! I wish I was on one of our warships, bravely defending us all. Blowing up Pugs, getting paid. It sounds amazing!"`
	"CN-7896" `	"What was it like, fighting those nasty, evil Pugs?"`
	"CN-7897" `	"War is hell, kid. I'm not going to glorify it for you."`
	"CN-7898" `	"Actually, they're not evil. Their 'war' was a ploy to get us to stop fighting among ourselves. A lot of Pug gave their lives willingly to save us from self-destruction."`
	"CN-7899" `	"Leading a battle is like chess with guns and engines. It's the most exhilarating feeling I've ever felt."`
	"CN-7900" `	"It was an honor to protect the human race from our attackers."`
	"CN-7901" `	"Woah, you sound really smart. Like one of those sensible experts in the vids! Still, without people like you, the Pug's plan couldn't have worked. I still reckon you were the best, Captain."`
	"CN-7902" `	"You went through hell for us, eh? That sounds less fun than I thought... Maybe I should stick to school and be an engineer instead of a pilot. I dunno."`
	"CN-7903" `	"The Syndicate is training me to maintain and they're even going to train me to pilot their combat ships when I'm older! One day, I'll fight aliens like you did."`
	"CN-7904" `	"Honor... and service. The Syndicate will train boys like me, but I've wondered about joining the Navy. It isn't as profitable, but it sounds more noble."`
	"CN-7905" `	You arrive at the repair shop, and an older boy, perhaps seventeen, meets the two of you. Gus stands to attention and gives you a well-practiced salute. You politely salute him in return.`
	"CN-7906" `	As Gus ends his salute, the boy attacks him from behind, putting him into a choke hold. It's clear he's taking extreme care when doing it. "Did you wander out of the childcare district? Was it the spaceport landing area this time? I can see scratches and bruises all over you." Gus replies, "I'm sorry, Calvin! I was curious."`
	"CN-7907" `	Calvin lets him out of the hold and says to you, "Thank you for saving my brother. He's the only family I have left, and I hope," he pinches him, "he'll stop risking his life out of curiosity." He looks at Gus kindly. "Come on, let's get you to the medic."`
	"CN-7908" `	Calvin waves goodbye as he walks his brother in.`
	"CN-7909" `Suddenly you hear raised voices and shouting outside as pilots run for their ships: "<destination> is being occupied by a pirate fleet! They are requesting help from any combat-worthy ship that can get there by <date> to join the defenses!" The authorities of <planet> will probably pay you quite well if you assist them, but this could also be an easy way to get yourself killed.`

	"CN-7945" `	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`

The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`

	"CN-7950" `	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	"CN-7953" `	You look up from your tablet just before running head-on into a gray-furred Hai wearing a flight suit, knocking him over. As you bend over to help, he takes a glance at your mortgage documents. "You're about to become a captain, aren't you?" he says after dusting himself off.`

	"CN-7958" `	He scratches the back of his head. "Sorry. I was just trying to help, but if I'm causing too much trouble, I'll get out of your way.`
	"CN-7959" `	"I don't mind."`
	"CN-7960" `	"I'd rather handle things myself."`
	"CN-7961" `	He bows. "Thank you."`
	"CN-7962" `	The Hai brings you to the landing pads of Greenwater, where a large number of humans and Hai are gathered around several vessels. From the crowd, another Hai approaches your companion, talking to him in Hai. The gray-furred Hai simply nods and hands the other Hai a set of keys in exchange for a credit chip. The other Hai quickly bows before dashing towards one of the landed ships.`
	"CN-7963" `	"I'm selling off my fleet before retiring," the Hai says. "Sure, I could just go to the shipyard, but I could never have started if it weren't for another retiring captain selling me a ship for cheap when I was young. So, I've decided to pay it forward and help out other captains-to-be."`
	"CN-7964" `	The Hai walks up to one of the smaller ships in the fleet, a Grasshopper interceptor. "This is the Pristine Jewel. She's served me well over the past century, but I'm sure she'll be safe in your hands."`
	"CN-7965" `	"You're giving it to me?"`
	"CN-7966" `	"Is there a freighter I could take instead?"`
	"CN-7967" `	"What about the other people here? Shouldn't they get first pick?"`
	"CN-7968" `	The Hai chuckles. "That would be nice, wouldn't it? Unfortunately, retirement isn't cheap. I'd be happy to part with her for 1.132 million credits, though; that's less than a Aphid, let alone a new Grasshopper.`
	"CN-7969" `	"Unfortunately, all my Aphids were bought earlier today. Still, I'm sure you can survive; the Unfettered'll be a tough ask, but pirates in human space won't be much of a match. Plus, if you still can't handle it, you can always sell her. She'll only cost you 1.132 million credits, and you'll be able to use the old parts of the Pristine Jewel to buy an Aphid at a discount.`
	"CN-7970" `	The Hai shakes his head. "Don't worry. Most of the crowd are just spectators. Usually it'd be a human captain pulling a stunt like selling their fleet publicly; most retiring Hai just donate their fleets to the government. I'm not exactly handing these ships out for free either. If you want her, the Pristine Jewel's 1.132 million credits.`
	"CN-7971" `	"So, do we have a deal?"`
	"CN-7972" `	"We do!"`
	"CN-7973" `	"I think I'd be better off buying from the shipyard."`
	"CN-7974" `	"Great!" He holds out a data tablet. "Just sign here, and she's yours."`
	"CN-7975" `	The Hai gives you the keys to the Grasshopper after you hand over the tablet and your payment. "Looks like this your first step to becoming an interstellar entrepreneur. I'd say we'll meet again someday, but I'd rather not lie. In all my years, I never did meet the captain who sold me my first ship again. Not that that should matter, anyway; this is your story, not mine."`
	"CN-7976" `	He gives you one last salute before returning to the crowd to sell yet another ship.`
	"CN-7977" `	He nods as you head towards the shipyard.`
	"CN-7978" `	At its entrance is an automated security kiosk. You quickly fill out the form on the screen before picking up the stylus and signing your name:`
	"CN-7979" `	You step through glass sliding doors into Greenwater's shipyard. In most of the berths, workers are busy refurbishing old vessels for resale, but in some of the more distant bays, you can see the flash of welding torches on brand-new ship skeletons. Vessels of all sizes are lined up within the yard, but for you, there's only one option...`
	"CN-7980" `The first thing you notice about this Earth-like world is the utter devastation in orbit. Your ship's sensors pick up the remains of what appear to be dozens of wrecked stations and countless destroyed satellites, forming a large swath of debris scattered in various orbits. A few larger objects are mostly intact, but lifeless, with no signal emissions or heat signatures. As your ship touches the upper atmosphere, you can see, even with your naked eye, glittering fragments of an immensely long tether slowly spinning in orbit.`
	"CN-7981" `	Your observations are interrupted by a blared warning from your console. You barely manage to yank your ship aside as a bright trail of plasma nearly clips you, the wake of a hypervelocity projectile fired from the ground. Clearly, someone is still alive down there, despite the destruction in orbit. Proceeding could be dangerous if your ship isn't able to withstand a direct hit from those planetary defense batteries.`
	"CN-7982" `	(Attempt to land regardless.)`
	"CN-7983" `	(Move to a higher orbit.)`
	"CN-7984" `The first thing you notice about this habitable world is the utter devastation in orbit. Your ship's sensors pick up the remains of what appear to be a handful of wrecked stations and countless destroyed satellites, forming a large swath of debris scattered in various orbits. A few larger objects are mostly intact, but lifeless, with no signal emissions or heat signatures. As your ship touches the upper atmosphere, you can see the tumbling remains of what looks like half of an enormous starship with an equally large drive, splintered and broken along its spine.`
	"CN-7985" `	You make it no more than a few seconds before your ship is lanced by a rapid succession of shots from below. Your shields shatter almost instantly, your hull pierced as though it is tissue paper. You don't even have time to think before you are consumed by the rapidly expanding cloud of plasma that was once the <ship>.`
	"CN-7986" `	You make it no more than a few seconds before the <ship> is lanced by a rapid succession of shots from below. Your ship appears to be holding up under the fire, but the species that lives here doesn't seem willing to welcome you. When you detect the launch of a rather unreasonable number of missiles, you decide it would be safer to proceed back to orbit.`
	"CN-7987" `	You make it no more than a few seconds before the <ship> is lanced by a rapid succession of shots from below. Your ship easily shrugs off the kinetic impacts, but the species that lives here doesn't seem willing to welcome you. When you detect the launch of a rather unreasonable number of missiles, you decide it would be safer to proceed back to orbit.`
	"CN-7988" `While this world looks presently unsettled, you can clearly make out signs that it has been explored, and even exploited, by an alien civilization. However, the signs also show that something disastrous happened here. Ruined satellites litter low orbit, and you can detect the broken remnants of surface outposts smeared across the land below. You take the <ship> in for a close pass over one of the structures, and can see small craters and patches of glassed terrain scattered around it.`
	"CN-7989" `	Back in orbit, you are startled when another ship appears over the horizon on an intercept trajectory with you. It doesn't look like any other ship you've seen before, appearing more than a little ungainly compared to the sleeker human ships you're accustomed to. You aren't sure whether it belongs to the same species that inhabits this space, or an entirely different one, but it at least definitely isn't similar to the hostile ships that seem to infest this star cluster.`
	"CN-7990" `	(Try transmitting a standard hail.)`
	"CN-7991" `	(Transmit a series of prime numbers.)`
	"CN-7992" `This alien station has certainly seen better days. While the bulk of the structure is still intact, avoiding the fate of whatever became the debris fields you have seen elsewhere, the hull is scored and chipped by what appears to be powerful weapons fire. The station's systems all seem to be powered down, as you can detect no emissions of light or heat. Without expecting to find anyone or anything alive, you maneuver near what you think is an open docking bay.`
	"CN-7993" `	Just as the <ship> pulls alongside the "docking bay," you spot what looks like a ship tucked away inside. It is like no ship you have ever seen before, appearing more than a little ungainly compared to the sleeker human ships you're accustomed to. You aren't sure whether it belongs to the same species that inhabits this space, or an entirely different one, but it at least definitely isn't similar to the hostile ships that seem to infest this star cluster. What's more, its reactor is powered up and it seems to have an active shield matrix. It appears someone is indeed home.`
	"CN-7994" `	(Transmit a standard hail.)`
	"CN-7995" `	You aren't quite sure how to proceed in communicating with a completely unknown species, but you transmit a standard hail, if only to assure the alien vessel that you're trying to signal it.`
	"CN-7996" `	To your shock, however, the alien vessel responds after only a few minutes, not only in the same frequency band, but with an encoding your ship's computer is able to interpret: a standard human data format, similar to the one you've just sent. Either these aliens have an astonishing ability to decipher transmissions, or they have somehow encountered humanity before.`
	"CN-7997" `	The message is short and direct:`
	"CN-7998" `	You can't expect a new alien species to be able to decode your transmissions, let alone understand your language, so you transmit a short list of prime numbers via simple amplitude modulated signals, if only to assure the alien vessel that you're attempting to communicate.`
	"CN-7999" `	To your shock, however, the alien vessel interrupts you just as you send the number "37," with a transmission not only in the same frequency band, but with an encoding your ship's computer is able to interpret: a standard human data format, similar to the one you've just sent. They must have somehow encountered humanity before.`
	"CN-8000" `	Unsure of the intentions of the alien vessel, you remain silent. However, it seems the aliens have other intentions, as you shortly receive a transmission with an encoding your ship's computer is able to interpret, in a standard human data format. The message is short and direct:`
	"CN-8001" `	"Salutations. I am of the Avgi. You human, question? Important. You will follow. This space, Twilight, not safe. You have hyperdrive, correct? Emphasis. Space we will travel is unstable, a maze. Follow closely and be careful."`
	"CN-8002" `	The message includes an alien-looking star chart, with a trail of marked systems leading to a system far to the south. Something appears to have been lost in translation, as the systems are unmarked past a certain point and are instead labeled as "shrouded," whatever that means. Just as you are still processing first contact with an alien civilization, a group of the same ships that attacked you earlier jump into the system.`
	"CN-8003" `After a confusing journey through the winding hyperlanes, you finally arrive at the final system the alien marked on your map. You notice that your flight computer has failed to record the locations of most of the systems you passed through, probably due to the same anomaly that made your ship almost completely blind within the region. This region appears unaffected however, and your computer is able to chart its position as usual.`
	"CN-8004" `	The alien ship pings you, indicating to follow as it flies towards what looks to be a large inhabited station in the system. Shaped like a circular disk, a large cutout in the center exposes hundreds of docking bays and what looks to be a spaceport. As you watch, a trio of sleek-looking fightercraft launch from the station and take up escort positions around you and the other alien ship you have followed all this way. You can only assume your escort is in communication with the station authorities.`
	"CN-8005" `	Your companion speeds ahead, neatly pulling into one of the bays on the outer levels. When you attempt to follow, the fightercraft zip in front of you, herding you towards a different bay closer to the middle decks.`
	"CN-8006" `	The docking bay is full of activity, and you finally get your first glimpse at this new species up close. They appear to be something analogous to an Earth dragonfly, or maybe closer to a damselfly - a meter and a half long on average, and with six limbs and wings. A group of them quickly close in around your ship as you finally land in a clear space, moving precisely. These aliens have clearly been expecting you.`
	"CN-8007" `	None of the aliens look to be armed, but are arrayed around your ship in a clearly defensive circular pattern, both on foot and flitting about in the air. Some of them look to be wearing some kind of body armor, but they don't seem to be carrying any obvious weapons. As you step out of the <ship>, noticing the lighter gravity, a small group quickly moves forward to meet you.`
	"CN-8008" `	"Hello, I'm Captain <first> <last>."`
	"CN-8009" `	"I come in peace."`
	"CN-8010" `	"Take me to your leader."`
	"CN-8011" `	(Shoot them.)`
	"CN-8012" `	You draw your sidearm and begin firing at the group of aliens, who scatter in all directions. Your first shot glances off alien body armor, but your second burns a hole in a wing, sending the alien tumbling. You have little time to celebrate your short-lived victory, however, before a flash of unfathomably bright blue-green light turns you into a rapidly expanding cloud of hot vapor.`
	"CN-8013" `	The aliens hum and chirp excitedly amongst themselves, the sound reminding you of a string instrument. You notice they seem to produce sounds not from any particular vocal organs, but by rubbing their forearms or legs together akin to a cricket. One of the aliens, with a cream-colored body, seems to hush the others, flaring their wings out before returning them to a folded position on their back. They then raise a curved, black instrument reminiscent of a violin bow, drawing it over one of their forelimbs for a moment before the device begins to speak in a synthetic, vaguely masculine voice.`
	"CN-8014" `	"Invitation. Welcome, Captain <first> <last>. I am Lait of the Avgi, the one with whom you spoke earlier. I would show you to our leaders to discuss your arrival to our space."`
	"CN-8015" `	(Follow the aliens.)`
	"CN-8016" `	"How can you speak my language?"`
	"CN-8017" `	"Who are those hostile aliens back toward the north?"`
	"CN-8018" `	"Will you tell me about your civilization?"`
	"CN-8019" `	"Reassurance. All of your questions will be answered in time, Captain <last>. Please, now follow."`
	"CN-8020" `	You are led through the hangar, an entourage of guards separating you from curious onlookers - pilots, mechanics, or soldiers, you aren't sure. It's a bit awkward to be corralled by a group of people whose height barely comes past your knees, but you allow yourself to be escorted nonetheless. After exiting through a downward sloping ramp set in the floor, you then follow a long passageway that seems to perpetually curve upwards. You're reminded of older space stations, ones that relied on spin gravity before gravity plating became commonplace. Surprisingly, despite the short stature of your hosts, the halls and doorways seem to be more than capable of accommodating your height, a feature that makes more sense after you see multiple instances of the aliens making their way in the air, rather than on foot.`
	"CN-8021" `	Eventually, after a number of turns and descents, you pass through an open archway into some kind of conference room. Large and circular with a high, rounded ceiling, it is occupied by a trio of multicolored dragonfly aliens, each perched on a metal ring running around a circular table.`
	"CN-8022" `	The alien directly across from you, gray-white in color, begins speaking with the aid of another of the translator devices - this time taking on a feminine voice.`
	"CN-8023" `	"Invitation. I apologize for the inconvenience of traveling so far from your ship to meet us, but I was advised against being present for your arrival for fear of any unexpected hostilities, as small as such chances were estimated. My name, for lack of a direct translation, is 'Asime,' and with me are Speakers Prasinos and Galano. Together, we represent the Avgi Consonance as the First Speakers of the Assembly of Polities."`
	"CN-8024" `	Prasinos, grass-green in color, and Galano, a frail-looking milky-white Avgi, both wave at you with their forelimbs in a somewhat surreal imitation of the human gesture.`
	"CN-8025" `	She twitches her wings slightly in what might be laughter. "Amusement. That would take a very long time to do in any detail, but I will make an attempt." Reverting back to her own language, she consults with the two other Avgi for a minute before turning back to you.`
	"CN-8026" `	"Pride, accomplishment. We are the Avgi. Our six systems, with seven worlds, and hundreds of orbitals each the size of a city, together a thousand polities united towards the betterment of civilization and progress-"`
	"CN-8027" `	Galano interrupts, his translator's voice sounding somehow aged. "Remembrance. But before all that, before the hyperdrive, we still crossed the void between stars. I was a child when the last true starship launched, but I remember. Long before we learned to surpass light, we settled the worlds beyond our home star system, at great cost and effort. We first touched space six centuries ago, and-"`
	"CN-8028" `	He is cut off by Prasinos. "Rebuke. You should start from the beginning, long before we left Aviskir. Our ancestors made their homes around the springs in the valleys of the Fel Mountains, and spread across our planet for millennia. From fire to spears to the atom, our skill in turning the natural world to our will grew, and with it our ability to form civilization: groups of Avgi bound together by more than close kinship or geography, instead by ideology and heritage and religion. And with that came conflict, each polity striving with the others to-"`
	"CN-8029" `	Now both Asime and Galano make noises of dissent, and Galano, sounding rather hurried, interrupts. "Urgency. Perhaps we are not as united as you, the humans, and it is true that we have fought many wars among ourselves. Emphasis. But that time is long since past. We saw reason, and so the Consonance was created, governed by an Assembly of Polities to represent every division of the Avgi, small or large. From the nation-states to the ideolopoli, a consensus government of our species to resolve disputes, to prevent another Great War. And while there have still been wars fought by the foolish and shortsighted, there has not been a nuclear initiation on Aviskir's surface in more than a century. The Assembly, for all its faults, works."`
	"CN-8030" `	Asime adds, "Truth. And we are what the Avgi need, now that all of that could be lost to the Incursion, to the Aberrant it spawned. We need what humanity has, a united Republic to lead all of our people."`
	"CN-8031" `	"How do you know of humanity?"`
	"CN-8032" `	"What are the Aberrant?"`
	"CN-8033" `	"That's all the questions I have. What happens now?"`
	"CN-8034" `	Prasinos thinks for a moment, then says, "Hesitance. It may come as a surprise to you, but you are not the first human to come to our space. Three- no, that would be six of your years ago, an alien ship was found drifting around a star in our space, swarmed by Aberrations. By some miracle they were driven away, and the ship recovered. And those were the first, and until now, the only humans we have had the honor of meeting. A crew of explorers from, I believe they said, 'the depths,' though I am not quite sure if that is a planet or a region of space."`
	"CN-8035" `	"Appreciation. They have told us much of humanity, and developed these devices so as to allow us to more easily communicate. And without the ability to return home, they now live among us, helping where they can with their knowledge of humanity's advanced technologies."`
	"CN-8036" `	"What are these 'Aberrations?'"`
	"CN-8037" `	"Tell me more about the Avgi."`
	"CN-8038" `	"I don't know if I'd call human technology advanced."`
	"CN-8039" `	"That's all the questions I have. I'd like to meet these humans."`
	"CN-8040" `	Galano speaks. "Appreciation. Perhaps not to you, but humanity has had the hyperdrive since long before we reached our homeworld's moon. I have seen the changes and advancements even a handful of decades can bring, and your species' advantage over us of centuries has brought you miracles such as shields and repulsors."`
	"CN-8041" `	Galano speaks. "Sorrow. The Aberrant, as we call them, remain enigmatic despite all they have taken from us. From where they came, we are not completely certain. They came two decades ago, from the east, beyond the reach of our knowledge, from a perilous region of space we have found difficult to probe. The scouts and explorers on the fringes of known space went dark first, and then the outposts fell one by one."`
	"CN-8042" `	Asime continues. "Regret. By the time the Consonance finally took note, the Aberrant swept away the ships Aviskir's polities were able to gather to oppose them. An entire generation of the Twilight Guard, wiped away in a single battle. Their technology is far beyond our own, and at the time it was impossible to oppose them. And the few Aberrations we were able to destroy baffled us. No crew, just a single organic entity inside. And systems operating on principles unknown to us. It can be said that we learned how to make shields from humanity, but we first learned what shields could do from the Aberrant."`
	"CN-8043" `	Prasinos says, "Anger. And thus we find ourselves here. When the hopelessness of the military situation became evident, every ship with a hyperdrive was ordered to take on passengers and make its way into the Tangled Shroud - this confusing web of broken starways and shadowed space that we now must call home. We abandoned our planets to the mercy of the Aberrant with little more than their surface defenses, scavenging the orbital infrastructure that had been painstakingly built over the centuries."`
	"CN-8044" `	He is interrupted by Asime, who seems annoyed. "Clarification. We were not heartless. The decision to evacuate was only made once it became evident the Aberrant had little interest in orbital bombardment, and that our surface batteries could drive off the ones that did. And we took tens of millions of civilians with us, in cryosleep, to be revived as resources allow."`
	"CN-8045" `	"Resolve. We will return. We have suffered a defeat, yes, but we will reclaim our systems in the end," says Galano with finality. The others do not dispute this.`
	"CN-8046" `	"How do you know my language?"`
	"CN-8047" `	Prasinos says, "Assurance. Of course, we will introduce your fellow humans to you. But..." he trails off.`
	"CN-8048" `	Asime continues for him. "Apprehension. The humans that came here before you, I must confess are still here for a reason. Perhaps they can give more details, but they have told us that when they first entered our space, they immediately attempted to leave. For whatever reason, they were unable to. I do not know the means by which you were able to travel to our space, but perhaps you will be able to return, and take these stranded humans with you."`
	"CN-8049" `	"Or, you may find yourself trapped here, just as they are. In any case, we will of course make you as comfortable as we can, as an honored guest, and treat you as we would any foreign dignitary."`
	"CN-8050" `	"I have a jump drive that lets me travel beyond the hyperlanes, but it won't let me jump back to human space."`
	"CN-8051" `	"I have a device that lets me go where I please, but it isn't working at the moment."`
	"CN-8052" `	"Regret. Then the situation is most unfortunate," she says. "Commitment. We will offer you what help we can, but I did not wish to lie to you about their predicament, or provide you with false hope."`
	"CN-8053" `	"Reservation. Perhaps Captain <last> will be able to find a solution." says Galano. "I would not dismiss the possibility too quickly."`
	"CN-8054" `	"While I'm here, can I buy your technology?"`
	"CN-8055" `	"Is there anything I can do to help in the meantime?"`
	"CN-8056" `	"Consideration. As an alien, you will inevitably be a novelty to most of us, but the existence of humans is well-known among the public enough for you to walk among us without issue. I will speak to others about a more formal role, but until then I am unsure if we can ask anything of you beyond keeping the peace."`
	"CN-8057" `	Galano says, "Interest. I would expect human technology to be superior to our own in most aspects, but we will of course allow you to purchase our items with the agreement of the Assembly. In the event that it becomes possible to open trade relations with your human government, we may find it useful to have prior transactions."`
	"CN-8058" `	"Amusement. Not to mention the goodwill such a gesture could buy us," says Asime.`
	"CN-8059" `	Prasinos says, more seriously, "Reservation. Our material resources are quite limited at the moment, so for now I would only support providing for the requisition of small items that do not strain the needs of the Guard."`
	"CN-8060" `	Asime looks like she wants to object, but then Galano says, "Agreement. A reasonable compromise, one I can sell to the Assembly fairly easily. Beyond that, we will provide you with a line of credit with which to purchase housing and nutrition. I cannot vouch for its usefulness among... certain elements that do not recognize the authority of Consonance, but anywhere else, you should find no issues."`
	"CN-8061" `	He twitches his wings. "Satisfaction. For now, we will leave you with some time and space to think. The former captain of the ship that brought the other humans, one Darius Calwell, is currently advising construction on the cylinder habitat in this system. You will find him on Aktina Cylinder, if you wish to speak with him. And should you wish to speak to us as well, there is one last gift we will bestow upon you today that will facilitate that."`
	"CN-8062" `	Before you are dismissed, he holds out a long arm, with a black hairpin-shaped rod clutched between his three sharp fingers, like a smaller version of the translator the Avgi have been using to communicate with you. Tucked behind your ear, this device will translate the speech of the most common Avgi languages as is it spoken around you, quietly whispering the meaning into your ear.`
	"CN-8063" `From afar, the Aktina Cylinder looks like a titanic skeletal tube, with ribs of graphene and a metallic spine. Following the instructions of the station's control authority, you fly through the station's open frame to its small pressurized area, which houses the construction workers and maintenance crews.`
	"CN-8064" `	You've been told that word of your arrival has been sent ahead of you, so you aren't entirely surprised to see a middle-aged human waiting for you, a look of pure astonishment on his face as your ship settles into a free hangar. You disembark from the <ship> to find Darius waiting right outside the hatch.`
	"CN-8065" `	"Hello there."`
	"CN-8066" `	"Greetings, human. I come in peace."`
	"CN-8067" `	The man blinks in surprise, then extends a hand, which you shake. "So, another one of us here in Fairyland. I don't know if I should be glad to see another friendly face, or feel bad that another soul is stranded here along with us." He shakes his head. "Let's find somewhere to talk. If you don't mind telling me, how'd you end up here anyway?"`
	"CN-8068" `	"I have a jump drive."`
	"CN-8069" `	"I have a device that can bypass hyperlanes."`
	"CN-8070" `	He somehow manages to look even more astonished as you walk. "A jump drive? Where the hell did you get one of those?"`
	"CN-8071" `	"I took it from some hostile aliens near the Core."`
	"CN-8072" `	"I took it from some aliens in the Deneb system."`
	"CN-8073" `	"I got it from the Syndicate, who took it from an alien race near the Core."`
	"CN-8074" `	"I took it from some angry space squirrels."`
	"CN-8075" `	"I took it from the Quarg."`
	"CN-8076" `	"I'm afraid I can't tell you that."`
	"CN-8077" `	He looks skeptical. "Alright then, keep your secrets."`
	"CN-8078" `	"Aliens other than the Quarg?" You nod. "Huh. I've heard rumors about alien attacks in the Core before, but I always thought it was the Syndicate making excuses for the out-of-control piracy in the region."`
	"CN-8079" `	"Deneb? There's no hyperlanes to that system, are there? Strange." He looks thoughtful for a moment. "I've heard stories before, of... never mind, excuse me."`
	"CN-8080" `	"The Hai have jump drives? I didn't think their technology was that advanced." He looks thoughtful. "Unless they got them from someone else, that is."`
	"CN-8081" `	"...What? You're kidding, right? How the hell did you defeat a Quarg ship?" He looks worried for a second, taking a step back. "Do I even want to be seen associating with you?" He laughs nervously.`
	"CN-8082" `	Darius shakes his head for a moment, then looks back at you. "Well, since you're still here, I'm assuming your jump drive couldn't get you out of here?" You tell him about how you were unable to jump back to human space, and he nods along.`
	"CN-8083" `	"There has to be a way out, I just know it. But in six years, we've only been able to spend a few days at a time in the systems bordering human space, before those damn space shoggoths forced us back. And," he lowers his voice, looking around surreptitiously, "I don't think the Avgi are that enthusiastic about us trying to map the place either. I don't think they're exactly trying to keep us here or anything, but they've been pretty insistent on us humans not getting ourselves killed doing something stupid, like say, desperately trying to find a way back to our homes." He sounds frustrated.`
	"CN-8084" `	"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find a way back home."`
	"CN-8085" `	"The Avgi are trying to keep you here? That's worrying."`
	"CN-8086" `	"How'd you end up in Avgi space without a jump drive?"`
	"CN-8087" `	"I'm probably just paranoid. After all, they're really enthusiastic about trying for an alliance with humanity to help them against these Aberrant, no matter how many times I explain humans aren't really all that technologically advanced. But they think if I can find a way home, we might be able to find a way to open up a connection between human space and Avgi space, especially given the way we got here. Not that I'd want to do that, with the chance of the Aberrant overrunning human space."`
	"CN-8088" `	"Sometimes I find it hard to believe that we'll ever make it home, but it helps to tell myself there's hope," he says.`
	"CN-8089" `	"Funny story, that," he says. "We were part of a big convoy from Valhalla, sponsored by one of the major universities there. I was working with Deep Security, after my stint in the Navy... ended." He trails off. "Anyway, we were in a Mule carrying some scanning equipment. To research the Quarg, you see. Officially we were there for cultural outreach and exchange, you know, the usual, but really we wanted some good scans of a Wardragon. The Quarg don't really approve of it, but they don't do much to discourage it either."`
	"CN-8090" `	He continues. "So, we were on our way back, just entering Dabih. Really successful trip and everything, with a big bonus waiting for me thanks to how long the trip across the entire Republic took. But then our scanners started picking up weird readings from particular hyperlanes, and we started hearing some pirates chattering about how something weird was happening in the Sadr system. A new hyperlane, pointing south, they said. It was just a few jumps away from our current location, and we were the only Deep ship in the area that could go off alone."`
	"CN-8091" `	He looks at his hands. "So I... I made the decision, as captain. I volunteered my crew to investigate it, to travel through that hyperlane in the name of science. For what the Deep holds highest, because I guess I wanted... I don't know. Not the prestige. But to live up to what the Deep's supposed to be, the ones at the forefront of human exploration and research. They took me in when I had nowhere else to go, and I guess I wanted to repay that somehow. And now, now a dozen good men and women are dead, and the rest are stuck here behind a hyperlane that closed the moment we went through it, living among aliens fighting a war of extinction that they probably can't win."`
	"CN-8092" `	"The other members of your crew, where are they now?"`
	"CN-8093" `	"There are a few of us left," he sighs, "but, well, I'm not on the best of terms with them. They blame me for bringing them here, and I can't fault them for it."`
	"CN-8094" `	"That seems unfair. There's no way you could have known what would happen."`
	"CN-8095" `	"Is there a chance of reconciling with them?"`
	"CN-8096" `	"I've made... a lot of mistakes. Ones with a price paid in lives. But," he looks down, "...maybe. They don't hate me or anything like that, we just... keep our distance. Sora's off doing who knows what with the Twilight Guard on Weledos, and Leon is on and off with those mining guilds to the East. There are a few others left too, but like I said. A price paid in lives."`
	"CN-8097" `	"I wish it was that simple. I made more mistakes after that, ones with a price measured in lives. Eleven dead after our ship was disabled, all because I ordered us to get too close to the scary-looking alien ships in the hope we could communicate with them. Sure, you could say I couldn't have known the Aberrant would try to kill us, but I ignored the advice of my crew, just because I was desperate to get home. Sora, Leon, they both told me we should run, but I didn't listen to them."`
	"CN-8098" `	You sit together in silence for a few more minutes, when Darius seems to receive a message on his communicator. "I get patched in to the emergency alert system," he explains as he reads it. Suddenly, he pales. "A scout is reporting a massive invasion headed towards the Ensemble system. Dozens of Aberrations, flying straight through the Shroud." He looks up at you. "They don't normally try to go too deep in the Shroud. Something about it spooks them, I think, but Ensemble is shallow enough that they've attacked it before. Nothing of this scale though, and... damn, Sora's on Weledos, the moon in the Ensemble system."`
	"CN-8099" `	He looks at you, hopeful. "We've got to do something. The Avgi are assembling a relief force around the Navigeo Yards, their big shipyard not too far from here. Come on, let's join it."`
	"CN-8100" `Navigeo is buzzing with activity as you pull into one of the few open berths available. Avgi ships of all sizes, painted in the deep blue of the Twilight Guard, launch every few minutes, replaced moments later by battle-scarred warships that slip into dry dock for repair.`
	"CN-8101" `	Parked a few kilometers from the station, a fleetgroup is assembling in a wide formation. You see a handful of cruiser-sized ships, along with a dozen smaller ships congregated around them. You hail them, asking to join the formation, and a surprised Avgi admiral directs you to fly towards the Ensemble system.`
	"CN-8102" `	"Warning. Atomics will be used in the upcoming battle, so stay your distance from our warheads," she says. "It would be appreciated if you flew ahead of our fleet and cleared out any straggler Aberrant in the way, so that we can save as many atomics for the battle in Ensemble."`
	"CN-8103" `	"Acknowledged."`
	"CN-8104" `	"Wait, nuclear weapons? You people use those?"`
	"CN-8105" `	"Confusion. Yes, of course. What else would we use, beam weapons?" She flicks her wings. "Don't tell me you're a beam fan, I'll have you know guided weapons win every time."`
	"CN-8106" `	"It's nothing, I was just surprised."`
	"CN-8107" `	"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with weapons of genocide."`
	"CN-8108" `	"Annoyance. It's not like we're using them against civilian targets, or even a planetary target to begin with. Honestly, you humans have some strange sensibilities."`
	"CN-8109" `	She turns away from the viewscreen as another Avgi starts speaking to her, dismissing you with a flick of her fingers.`
	"CN-8110" `You land on Weledos after the battle, while most of the surviving Avgi ships begin temporary repairs in orbit before they travel back to the Navigeo Yards. While you and Darius are checking the <ship> for damage, you hear someone walk up with distinctly human footsteps.`
	"CN-8111" `	"So, those rumors weren't all talk. There really is another one of us here." You look up to see a woman in combat fatigues standing in front of you, hand extended.`
	"CN-8112" `	(Shake her hand.)`
	"CN-8113" `	She drops her hand after a moment. "Name's Sora. And you?"`
	"CN-8114" `	"Name's Sora. And you?"`
	"CN-8115" `	"Captain <first> <last>," you say.`
	"CN-8116" `	"And I see you've got a tagalong, too. Finally got ol' Darius to come out of his shell, did you?" You look over at Darius, a look of deep shame on his face as he stares at the ground.`
	"CN-8117" `	"Now, I'm very interested in how exactly you managed to find your way here. Care to explain?" she asks.`
	"CN-8118" `	You fill Sora in on how your travels brought you here, and how you were able to acquire a jump drive. Darius says nothing throughout, standing by silently.`
	"CN-8119" `	"Amazing. So, your jump drive can get us out of here then?"`
	"CN-8120" `	"I'm afraid not. It can't return to human space for some reason."`
	"CN-8121" `	"No, but I'm not giving up on finding a different way out."`
	"CN-8122" `	"Nope!"`
	"CN-8123" `	"Damn. That would be too easy, I guess. But it's been too long since I've seen a fresh human face. I've been working for the Twilight Guard here for months, trying to build up a second line of defenses in case that station in Arche falls. At least today's battle shows those defenses, together with a supporting fleet, can hold. You mind if I tag along with you, in case you do manage to find a way out?"`
	"CN-8124" `	"Sure, as long as Darius doesn't mind."`
	"CN-8125" `	You look over at Darius, who responds after a few seconds of silence. "Of course you can come along, Sora."`
	"CN-8126" `	"Sounds good to me, then. I'll see you around when you're ready to leave." She walks off to collect her belongings.`
	"CN-8127" `	A few hours later, an Avgi cruiser, a Refraktos-class Laserstar, settles down on the pad next to yours, and an Avgi officer disembarks.`
	"CN-8128" `	"Salutations. Hello, Captain <first> <last>. My name is Kokkino, Captain of the Spectral Collision. Tell me, is the <ship> a warship, question?"`
	"CN-8129" `	"Yes, the <ship> is as powerful as they come."`
	"CN-8130" `	"No, the <ship> isn't made for combat."`
	"CN-8131" `	"Consideration. But, are you still willing to help us in a way that takes advantage of your ship's ability to bypass the starways, question?"`
	"CN-8132" `	"I'll hear you out."`
	"CN-8133" `	"Approval. That is very good, for your unique capabilities may help us save the lives of some very brave people. Come, meet me in the spaceport in an hour." He gives you a set of directions to a small building in Ensemble's main spaceport before leaving. "We will have much to discuss."`
	"CN-8134" `	"Excellent. I am unsurprised, given its performance in the battle, but for all we know your alien vessel could be a simple freighter and yet still be formidable in our eyes. Are you willing to assist us with your warship's strength, question?"`
	"CN-8135" `	"Enthusiasm. Your help will save many lives. Then, if you would, meet me in the spaceport in an hour." He gives you a set of directions to a small building in Ensemble's main spaceport before leaving. "We will have much to discuss."`
	"CN-8136" `	Darius exits the <ship> behind you. "What was that about?" he asks.`
	"CN-8137" `	"It sounds like they'd like my help with something."`
	"CN-8138" `	"I'm going to help them with the war effort."`
	"CN-8139" `	He frowns. "I see. When do you think we'll be able to head up north to look for a way out?"`
	"CN-8140" `	"We'll do it soon, I promise."`
	"CN-8141" `	"I'm not sure."`
	"CN-8142" `	He looks a little disappointed, then collects himself. "Well, I suppose there's no real urgency to it. Though, I've been thinking. If your jump drive wasn't able to let you escape from the north, there might not be a point in looking in that direction."`
	"CN-8143" `	"What do you suggest?" you ask.`
	"CN-8144" `	"I have a friend among the Avgi, one who doesn't frequent the official circles in the Consonance as much. There's a number of hideaways and side branches in the Tangled Shroud, with outposts mostly ran by miners and small-time shipbuilders. Just the kind of people who talk a lot among themselves about rumors and tall tales. The official story of the Incursion, the invasion of the Aberrant, is that they came from a chain of systems in the East, but no one ever talks about where exactly that chain leads. I think we should pay my friend a visit after you wrap up this next mission."`
	"CN-8145" `You follow Kokkino's instructions to a prefab building in the spaceport, which looks to be some kind of command center. Kokkino is waiting for you by a table in the middle, which lights up, displaying a map of Avgi space with some colored markings you can't read.`
	"CN-8146" `	"Explanation. We send scouting teams and patrols into the space controlled by the Aberrant regularly. Every expedition beyond Evanescence is essentially behind enemy lines, cut off from resupply and in many cases communication. As you might imagine, such adventures are fraught with danger, and it is unfortunately not unheard of for a scout ship to be lost."`
	"CN-8147" `	"Yes, I've found that exploration is often dangerous."`
	"CN-8148" `	"Sounds like you should build stronger scout ships."`
	"CN-8149" `	"Agreement. The Polari are a fine line of vessels, but not one made for the environment of war. We have experimented with using the Prismaios as an intelligence platform in more contested environments, but it lacks the versatility and drone bays that has made the Polari so venerable in the first place."`
	"CN-8150" `	He flicks his wings. "Regret. It is a sad truth, but those on the forefront of expanding our knowledge are often those who face the most danger from the unknown."`
	"CN-8151" `	"But, to the point. A scout team, aboard the Polari-class scout 'Silver Albedo,' was sent to survey the Twirl system two weeks ago, but has missed its check-in by multiple days. To reach that star cluster and return would normally require a trip of weeks, all through perilous territory, and I am ashamed to say that we could be forced to consider writing off the scouts as lost. But I have heard that the visiting human, Captain <last>, is in possession of a new kind of faster-than-light drive, one that can travel without the need for starways. Tell me, is this true, question?"`
	"CN-8152" `	"Yes, it's called a jump drive."`
	"CN-8153" `	"Excitement. Then, the trip could be shortened to mere days, giving us the possibility of mounting a rescue. I will mark the location of the Twirl system on your map, though it is probable that the Silver Albedo is elsewhere in the star cluster. The highest priority is of course the safe recovery of its crew, though if you could recover any data or samples they have managed to gather, that would also be much appreciated."`
	"CN-8154" `You maneuver alongside the Silver Albedo, which is covered in scorch marks and other signs of damage. After transmitting a code given to you by Captain Kokkino, you wait for any signs of life. After a few minutes you receive a response, which you pass through your translator.`
	"CN-8155" `	"Caution. Unfamiliar vessel, how did you obtain Consonance identification codes?"`
	"CN-8156" `	"There's no time for that. I'm here to rescue you."`
	"CN-8157" `	"I'm a space alien here in my alien spaceship here to rescue you aliens."`
	"CN-8158" `	"Amusement. Very well, I suppose we have little choice but to accept your help, opportune jester. As you can see, the Albedo is in something of a predicament."`
	"CN-8159" `	"Consideration. I suppose we have little choice but to accept your help, stranger. As you can see, the Albedo is in something of a predicament."`
	"CN-8160" `	You speak with the Avgi commander about treating the wounded as you dock your ship with the Silver Albedo. Any Avgi that are able to are clutching armfuls of recordings and logs as they come aboard. After everyone is safely transferred to the <ship>, you decouple from the derelict ship.`
	"CN-8161" `You receive a warm welcome back on Peripheria Station, as the former crew of the Silver Albedo disembarks. Some of the more badly injured crew members are carried out on hammock-like stretchers, but most are able to walk or fly out of the <ship> on their own power.`
	"CN-8162" `	After a short celebration and many expressions of deep gratitude toward you, you find Darius and Sora waiting by the <ship> to speak with you.`
	"CN-8163" `	"<first>, I think we have a golden opportunity," Darius says. "I was just talking to an Assemblyman, Hriso, who's worried about the political situation in the eastern branch of the Tangled Shroud."`
	"CN-8164" `	"A bunch of selfish cowards, they are," says Sora disdainfully.`
	"CN-8165" `	"Something about the miners grumbling about price controls on nickel-iron," Darius says after a moment, "but he wants to know if you could use your jump drive to take him there for some outreach to the miners without needing to spend weeks wandering through the mess of twisted hyperlanes. It's the perfect chance to meet my friend and ask him some questions. Meet me in the spaceport in an hour and we'll get this trip sorted out."`
	"CN-8166" `	"Explanation. The Aberrant are relentless, but as a rule push only lightly into the Tangled Shroud. The recent incursion excepted, of course. But Arche holds the first lines of defense, with the Feo Platform and its cannons." He points to a trinary system just outside the Shroud.`
	"CN-8167" `	"But, if we are to reclaim our homes, we cannot merely fight on the defensive. Thus, the front lines of this war are as of late drawn in the Quintessence system, and the triangle of systems to its north, which we are still in the process of clearing."`
	"CN-8168" `	"Where do I come in?"`
	"CN-8169" `	"Consideration. Your ship is far beyond anything we can produce indigenously, at least for the moment. While you are certainly skilled in fleet combat, I am of the opinion that you would be best put to use launching independent strikes, those that a single one of our vessels could not manage on their own."`
	"CN-8170" `	He looks down at a device similar to a tablet. "With the attack on Ensemble, we were forced to pull back our main fleetgroups from the front lines in Quintessence in an attempt to contain them. While we have since reclaimed many of our initial positions, during all the maneuvering a large number of Aberrant were able to slip past us, not into the Shroud, but rather north, towards the Empyrean system. With the current situation, I do not want to divert an entire strike force from the defenses to hunt them down. Report back to the Feo Platform when the Aberrant are eliminated."`
	"CN-8171" `You receive a hero's welcome back on the Feo Platform from the Twilight Guards stationed there. After a short celebration and many expressions of praise toward you, an alien stranger, you find Darius and Sora waiting by the <ship> to speak with you.`
	"CN-8172" `	"Something about the miners grumbling about price controls on nickel-iron," Darius says after a moment, "but he wants to know if you could use your jump drive to take him there for some outreach to the miners without needing to spend weeks wandering through the mess of twisted hyperlanes. It's the perfect chance to meet my friend and ask him some questions. We'll need to head to Peripheria to pick up Hriso and get this trip sorted out."`
	"CN-8173" `As you take the <ship> in for a landing in one of the hangars, Darius says, "I'll get in contact with Hriso and have him meet us in the spaceport."`
	"CN-8174" `Hriso turns out to be a yellow-orange Avgi of middling age. "Excitement. A true pleasure to meet you, Captain <first> <last>. I look forward to your company during these negotiations."`
	"CN-8175" `	"Aren't the Avgi united under the Consonance?"`
	"CN-8176" `	"Who are you negotiating with exactly?"`
	"CN-8177" `	He thrums in laughter. "One can only wish our species was that unified. No, membership in the Consonance is purely at-will, and many polities have chosen to go it alone even with the current crisis. Regret. The initial evacuation into the Tangled Shroud was haphazard to say the least, as much of it was, and still is, unmapped. Many captains took their ships down differing paths, meeting up with each other and forming alliances just to survive. In a way, it's a miracle that the Consonance was even able to reconstitute itself at all."`
	"CN-8178" `	"Those polities not fully aligned with the Consonance are largely independent of each other, but their movement has collectively been labeled as the 'Dissonance.' Imperative. Please do understand, we are not enemies, nor would I say we bear them any ill-will. The Dissonance participates in trade with us and de-facto follows the regulations passed by the Assembly, and each and every one of them wants the Aberrant scoured from our space as much as the rest of us."`
	"CN-8179" `	He looks directly at you. "The individuals we will be negotiating with on this trip are still loyal to the Consonance, merely unhappy with the price controls in place on certain minerals. Necessary for the Twilight Guard to expand the fleet," he explains.`
	"CN-8180" `	Sora says, "I still think they're a bunch of cowards. The existence of your species is threatened, and you let someone else do the fighting? Then you complain about the price they can pay for iron? What kind of person does that?"`
	"CN-8181" `	Hriso flicks his wings. "Reproach. The kind that still has to support themselves, and pay for the precision machinery they cannot make themselves. But we can discuss this later. For now, let us set off as soon as possible."`
	"CN-8182" `Outpost Tekis is a large station built into an asteroid several kilometers across, with networks of tubes and habitats crisscrossing the surface. You pull the <ship> into a cramped hangar dug into the rock and disembark with Hriso, who immediately sets out for a prearranged meeting place. You notice many of the Avgi in the outpost stare at you, Darius, and Sora, likely their first glimpse of a human.`
	"CN-8183" `	Together, you enter a large, round conference room with walls of polished rock. Waiting there are a handful of Avgi of various ages, who immediately begin conversing with Hriso in their own language.`
	"CN-8184" `	One of them looks at you and says, "Displeasure. So, do you expect a show of support by the aliens to move us? We were under the impression you were here to reconsider your positions, not calcify them."`
	"CN-8185" `	"What are they talking about?"`
	"CN-8186" `	"Rebuke. Captain <last> is not here on 'my' side, or any other, merely as an observer curious of our ways." Hriso turns to you. "Consideration. I suppose you might be curious about what we are discussing. The local mining guild here says they cannot sustain their operations with the low price on iron mandated by the Consonance, as we are not buying enough rarer metals like titanium to make up for it."`
	"CN-8187" `	"That's stupid," says Sora. "Without cheap steel we wouldn't be able to keep expanding Peripheria or build the Aktina Cylinder."`
	"CN-8188" `	Hriso doesn't translate that, returning to conversing with the miners. Sora pulls out a translator of her own, listening intently to the conversation, but Darius pulls you aside. "I had a talk with a few people on the way here, and they say there's someone who knows more about the first days after the Incursion. Come on."`
	"CN-8189" `	"What did they say?" you ask.`
	"CN-8190" `	"Apparently it's someone we have to meet in person," he grumbles. "I don't like it, but I don't think it's anything dangerous. Just inconvenient." You excuse yourself and walk along with Darius.`
	"CN-8191" `	Before long, you find yourself in some kind of mess hall, dozens of Avgi sipping from colorful drinks. Darius freezes as he spots a short man seated on a crude stool, the only human-style seating in the room, together with a few Avgi.`
	"CN-8192" `	"Darius. I didn't expect to see you here," he says. "And, what's this, another human here in Avgi space?"`
	"CN-8193" `	Darius takes a while to respond. "Leon. It's been a while."`
	"CN-8194" `	Leon snorts. "That's to say the least. Is Sora with you, or did you crawl here by yourself?"`
	"CN-8195" `	"She's helping with some negotiations."`
	"CN-8196" `	(Let Darius do the talking.)`
	"CN-8197" `	"She's with someone from the Consonance, negotiating with the miners here," says Darius.`
	"CN-8198" `	"And who's this?" Leon says, looking at you. "How'd you end up here, of all places?"`
	"CN-8199" `	"Captain <last>. I was stranded here, just like you."`
	"CN-8200" `	"<first>. Pleased to meet you."`
	"CN-8201" `	You quickly explain how you found yourself in Avgi space, and Leon nods. "That explains the questions the good Captain was asking," he says, nodding at Darius. "I've spent years collecting this information, from hearing the official narrative to dredging the corners of Avgi space for rumors."`
	"CN-8202" `	He leans in. "So, before I tell you this, one condition. I've spent months looking for a way to get a ship to take me to... well, you'll see. But not a lot of captains are willing to take their ships out of the Tangled Shroud and through the Aberrant blockade, so if this leads anywhere, I want a bunk on your ship."`
	"CN-8203" `	You open your mouth to reply, but Darius beats you to the punch. "Of course, Leon."`
	"CN-8204" `	"Good. Well, it more or less comes down to this: the Incursion didn't come out of nowhere. Everyone says they came from beyond the furthest reaches of Avgi exploration, but that's not quite true. The first to encounter them was a scout ship, which went down within minutes against their weapons. But not before they sent out a single garbled transmission to their sister ship, which fled back to the rest of the Avgi."`
	"CN-8205" `	He pauses, taking a drink of what looks like water. "They said they had found a gateway of sorts, an ancient alien artifact built by an unknown Antecessor species. Somehow, they had activated it, and that's where the first Aberrant came from."`
	"CN-8206" `	"And you want to use this gateway as a way out?"`
	"CN-8207" `	"Where do you think this gateway leads?"`
	"CN-8208" `	"I don't know where it leads, but it'll be somewhere other than Avgi space. Maybe somewhere your jump drive can work, which would let us eventually make our way back to human space. But it's better than sitting here and twiddling our thumbs for another six years."`
	"CN-8209" `	"Where is this gateway?" Darius asks.`
	"CN-8210" `	"The Aberrant came from the East, beyond the furthest reaches of the Twilight. A place the Avgi always had trouble exploring, due to strange energy storms periodically ionizing entire systems. But it's apparently recognizable by the red nebula suffusing it, just as the Twilight is surrounded by a cluster of blue nebulae."`
	"CN-8211" `	"I've heard of that area. It's called the Ember Waste."`
	"CN-8212" `	"Can it take us back to human space?" asks Leon, to which you nod.`
	"CN-8213" `	"There's no point in waiting, then. If there's a chance, even a small one, it's worth checking on," says Darius, looking hopeful for the first time since you've met him. You just hope his hope isn't a false one, for both of your sakes.`
	"CN-8214" `Just as your jump drive reacted strangely when you first entered Avgi space, it does so again, but this time the effect is inverted. The plasma from your jump lingers unnaturally, as though energized by something outside. Your instrumentation tell you your jump drive is much warmer than it should be just after a jump, almost hot enough to be dangerous. Perhaps your jump drive's range has changed as well?`
	"CN-8215" `As the purple flames of your jump drive fade, Darius, Sora, and Leon are all speechless. For the first time in six years, they are back in human space.`
	"CN-8216" `	"Heh, told you we'd make it."`
	"CN-8217" `	"We're out. Where to now?"`
	"CN-8218" `	Leon stares for a moment, then swears. "That damn magnetar was there the entire time? I was there for years. Years!"`
	"CN-8219" `	"We all were. And you wouldn't have been able to do anything with it without <first>'s jump drive," reminds Sora.`
	"CN-8220" `	"<first>," says Darius in a shaky voice. "Take us to the Deep, please. I need to see my home. And my wife."`
	"CN-8221" `	"Drop me off on Vinci first," interjects Leon. "I need to get my life in order again, and there's someone there I need to talk to about all this. It's on the way to the Deep, anyway."`
	"CN-8222" `The group is quiet as you set the <ship> down on the landing pad. You notice Sora watching out a window as Darius looks into his hands. As for Leon, he has been ready to leave even before you've hit the atmosphere, pacing near the hatch until the moment you open it.`
	"CN-8223" `	"I'm going to get some fresh air," says Sora, stepping in front of an outraged Leon out of nowhere, a reluctant Darius dragged along with her. "We'll be in the spaceport, so try not to leave without us."`
	"CN-8224" `	Leon, consigned to being the last one out, stops just before he leaves the <ship>, turning to you. "<first>. Thank you." He is uncharacteristically somber, his usual sense of disdain for the world missing, for the moment.`
	"CN-8225" `	"No, really. I was expecting to die back there, with those Avgi. Six years... I don't know how to thank you, but if you're ever in the area and you need anything don't hesitate to give me a call." With that, he shakes your hand and sets off in the direction Sora and Darius went, toward Vinci's spaceport.`
	"CN-8226" `	Remember to meet Darius and Sora in the spaceport before you leave Vinci.`
	"CN-8227" `You find Darius and Sora sitting outside a cafe, sipping coffee. "Been a long time since we've had a good cup," explains Sora, pulling a chair out for you.`
	"CN-8228" `	"What, no coffee in Avgi space?" you joke.`
	"CN-8229" `	"Nah, but you should try their drinks sometime. Man, they're something else."`
	"CN-8230" `	"There's nothing like being back, though," Darius says, quiet as he takes in the bustling spaceport around you. "It's hard to believe I'm really here. Harder to understand why it was I that made it out of there when so many who followed me didn't."`
	"CN-8231" `	"Oh, stop that." Sora swats the back of his head. "You're not the first to make a wrong turn into a bad neighborhood. Remember that story about your wife?" Her tone is playful, but you can see the look of worry in her eyes at the evident guilt Darius feels.`
	"CN-8232" `	Darius shakes his head, then continues. "We should get you home. Your parents probably still have that farm, it's been in the family for years. It's not too far from here, right?"`
	"CN-8233" `	A pause, and then Sora says, "Memory. I haven't been there in years, but I guess my apartment is definitely gone... so I have nowhere else to go for now."`
	"CN-8234" `	"Let's get to it then. <first>, could you take us to Memory?"`
	"CN-8235" `Memory is a dry world, covered in sands and shrubland. From the spaceport, the three of you catch a shuttle bus that heads out into the countryside, passing miles of cacti and dry plants that abruptly turn into greener fields of crops, probably irrigated by aquifers. It is one of these farms you finally arrive at, the one Sora says belongs to her parents. Traffic must be rare here, because only a few minutes after the bus stops the door to the well-maintained farmhouse opens, a middle-aged couple peering out.`
	"CN-8236" `	"...Sora? Is that you?" the older woman calls out while the man gapes in silence.`
	"CN-8237" `	Eyes shining, Sora gives you and Darius a crushing hug before she leaves you. "Thank you, <first>. And Darius," she gives him a stern look, "I'll be in touch. Don't be so hard on yourself." He nods mutely as she turns and runs towards the house.`
	"CN-8238" `	You don't want to interrupt the reunion, so you and Darius take your leave together, returning to the spaceport. Back aboard the <ship>, you sit in a comfortable silence for a while.`
	"CN-8239" `	"So, where do you want me to take you?"`
	"CN-8240" `	"So, where next?"`
	"CN-8241" `	"...I don't know. My wife, Katrina... we lived on Valhalla, but it's been six years. She probably thought I was dead, hell, the whole Republic probably thought I was dead. She..." he chokes up, "she's probably moved on by now. I would have wanted her to, she knew that."`
	"CN-8242" `	"You have to find out, one way or another. Let's go to Valhalla."`
	"CN-8243" `	"I'm sure she's been waiting for you. Let's go to Valhalla."`
	"CN-8244" `	"I don't know if I can face the truth. But I also can't just go my own way without even checking on her, just in case there's a chance she didn't give up in me."`
	"CN-8245" `	Darius rubs his eyes. "Thank you, <first>. I hope I'm wrong. Let's go to Valhalla."`
	"CN-8246" `You land in Valhalla's main spaceport, and Darius practically jumps out of your ship before it can even touch down. A quick call for an automated taxi, and you soon find yourselves outside an expansive, fancy-looking apartment complex. "Our old address," he explains. "We were still renting, but were looking at buying our apartment within a few years."`
	"CN-8247" `	You knock on the door to the right apartment, but it is answered by a tall man with black hair. "Hello, can I help you?" he asks cautiously.`
	"CN-8248" `	Darius looks crushed. "Is... Is there a Katrina here?"`
	"CN-8249" `	"Katrina? Can't say I've met anyone with that name in the five years I've lived here. Is that a friend of yours?"`
	"CN-8250" `	Darius looks morose as he turns away. "Yes. I'm sorry for troubling you, we'll be on our way."`
	"CN-8251" `	"Don't give up. She probably just moved or something."`
	"CN-8252" `	"We could try looking her information up."`
	"CN-8253" `	"Of course she did. But I don't understand why, buying that apartment was our dream. It doesn't make any sense!" He stops himself. "Sorry, <first>. I'm just on edge." He sighs before continuing. "I can try looking her up, maybe..." he trails off, thinking.`
	"CN-8254" `	"Any public records on Valhalla?" you ask.`
	"CN-8255" `	"...Yes, we'll try the record books. We can check them at the library."`
	"CN-8256" `	A short trip to the library later, and you sit at a table while Darius checks the public records. He scrolls down the list of names and addresses before stopping at a single name. "Katrina... Caldwell. Our name." Hope is plainly visible on his face. "She kept our name, at least."`
	"CN-8257" `	You glance over at the address, taking note of it. It looks like it's further out of the city. "Let's try the address. We can still make it there by tonight," you say.`
	"CN-8258" `	The address appears to be out in the country, and you take in the view as the taxi smoothly glides along the roads. Unlike on Memory, the landscape here is lush and green, with rolling hills, abundant forests, and rushing streams. You find that the address belongs to a cozy-looking riverfront house, a large garden visible next to it.`
	"CN-8259" `	Darius has never looked so nervous in his life, but you give him a gentle shove towards the door. His knocking is unanswered, and his face starts to once more slip into despair, but you hear a voice from the garden.`
	"CN-8260" `	"Darius? Is that you?" A woman with greying hair steps onto the porch, eyes shining. "You're back... I knew you were alive!" she cries out, rushing to embrace him. The two begin speaking, faster than you can follow, as you hang back somewhat awkwardly.`
	"CN-8261" `	After a few minutes, you try to excuse yourself, but Darius won't have it. "No, no, I owe this all to you, <first>. You're the only reason I'm here."`
	"CN-8262" `	Katrina looks at you curiously. "Aliens, huh? You don't look like an alien."`
	"CN-8263" `	"Huh?"`
	"CN-8264" `	"That's because I'm not."`
	"CN-8265" `	"Yeah, these skinsuits are pretty good."`
	"CN-8266" `	She bursts out laughing. "I wouldn't believe it if anyone else had told me. I mean, men come up with all sorts of excuses for coming home late, but this is something else!" Her tone suddenly turns serious. "It'll be a headache, working all this out with the government. They gave me the money for this place as recompense for your supposed 'death,' no matter how much I insisted you were still alive."`
	"CN-8267" `	"We'll work it out. They owe me backpay anyway," jokes Darius, still in Katrina's arms.`
	"CN-8268" `	As the pair move to the door, you say your goodbyes, and Darius promises he will keep in touch with you about the Avgi. Neither of you have forgotten the aliens fighting to survive at the edge of the galaxy, and now that you know of a safe way in and out of their space, you can go back without fear of becoming trapped.`
	"CN-8269" `While looking for a place to grab a snack, you discover most of the restaurants are on the terrace rings above your level of the spaceport. After some asking around, you come to the realization that Avgi structures simply weren't designed with flightless humans in mind, and you're forced to ask a very confused worker to use the spaceport's freight elevator to go up a single level.`
	"CN-8270" `As a dockyard worker helps you top off the <ship>'s fuel, you hear her mutter. "Incredulation. We're directed to give the alien free fuel while the rest of us are bleeding out of the eyes for every drop of dee."`
	"CN-8271" `As you walk through the spaceport, a pair of small Avgi flit above your head - children, perhaps - waving sticks at each other as part of some kind of game. One of them manages to knock the other's stick out of their hands, who then executes some sort of dizzying barrel roll before the two fly on out of sight.`
	"CN-8272" `An Avgi flies by, a pair of Avgi children sitting on her back. Nestled between them is some kind of cocoon, spun from silk that winds its way into a rope wrapped carefully around the mother's body.`
	"CN-8273" `A cheap electronic sign, haphazardly stuck to a wall, flashes a series of colorful symbols, sharp and angular. You aren't able to understand it, but guess it's probably an advertisement or notice of some kind.`
	"CN-8274" `A cheap electronic sign, haphazardly stuck to a wall, flashes a message in the colorful written language of the Avgi. "Zapchannel Ray Energy! With over three quadrillion gamma decays per serving, one dose provides enough energy for life! Buy today!"`
	"CN-8275" `A line of angry-looking Avgi march in a wide circle around the spaceport, while others dart overhead in a similar pattern. Most of them seem to be waving colorful flags, while a few of the Avgi in the air are trailing banners with large, angular letters in bright colors written on them. All of the Avgi, which seem to be participating in some kind of protest, are wearing bright magenta ribbons around their arms, a color that seems to be likewise prominent on their flags and banners.`
	"CN-8276" `A line of angry-looking Avgi march in a wide circle around the spaceport, while others dart overhead in a similar pattern. Most of them seem to be waving colorful flags, while a few of the Avgi in the air are trailing banners with colorful slogans on them. "STOP CONSONANCE TAXES," "ABOLISH MINERAL FEUDALISM," and "STOP SENDING US TO DIE" are just a few of the messages you can make out, all in the angular Avgi script. All of the Avgi are wearing bright magenta ribbons around their arms, a color that seems to be likewise prominent on their flags and banners.`
	"CN-8277" `You find colorful, curvy symbols scrawled all across the walls, floor, and ceiling of <planet>'s spaceport terminal, and you can see a handful of Avgi with brushes and mops attempting to remove them. You aren't sure what they say, but other Avgi seems to be laughing and pointing as they stroll by. The workers scrubbing the graffiti away seem to be less than amused, however.`
	"CN-8278" `Colorful, curvy symbols are scrawled all across the walls, floor, and ceiling of <planet>'s spaceport terminal, and you can see a handful of Avgi with brushes and mops attempting to remove them. Much of the paint has run down the walls or overlaps with other symbols, and what you can see is sloppy, but you can make out words like 'taxes' and 'defenestrate' and the phrase 'Twilight Guard? More like Twilight Gourd.'`
	"CN-8279" `An Avgi passes you, head buried in something that looks remarkably like a newspaper. You hear him mutter as he strolls by, "Unbelievable. We truly live in a society, consideration."`
	"CN-8280" `An pair of Avgi walk by you, deep in conversation. "Appreciation. I'm just glad we're being realistic here," says one. The other doesn't respond, but you sense a feeling of great despair.`
	"CN-8281" `An Avgi stands by a doorway, speaking into a megaphone. "Proclamation. Take warning, denizens! Without proper balance in your life, you'll be doomed! Doomed, I say! Just like those Korath I've heard about. The end times are near!"`
	"CN-8282" `An Avgi stands at a crossroads, waving a sign and a laser rifle. "Declaration. The Aberrant are polluting our precious bodily fluids, citizens! Take action now! We must not allow a fluid gap!"`
	"CN-8283" `	Security personnel soon arrive and begin trying to talk the Avgi down, eyeing the laser rifle nervously.`
	"CN-8284" `A bright green Avgi wearing a black scarf darts above you towards one of the spaceport terminal gates, a comically oversized burlap sack dangling behind her. A trio of Avgi dressed in bright yellow force their way through a confused crowd in mid-air, waving batons. "Attention! Stop, thief!"`
	"CN-8285" `	"Taunt! You'll never catch me alive!" the thief shouts, before promptly running into a wall. You shake your head as she's led away in restraints.`
	"CN-8286" `The spaceport is lit up by flashing yellow lights as a robotic voice proclaims its message. "Command. Radiation danger, seek prompt shelter. Command. Radiation danger, seek prompt shelter."`
	"CN-8287" `	The crowd has only barely had time to panic before the voice is cut off with a squeal of static. "Abashment. Apologies, false alert. Mindaro dropped his drink on the console, there is no radiation danger."`
	"CN-8288" `While walking through the spaceport on <planet>, you spot a pair of Avgi moving toward a large building. They are holding what look like long, thin rapiers.`
	"CN-8289" `	As you walk over to the two vibrantly colored Avgi, they glance in your direction. One of them, colored a muted teal, speaks up. "Invitation. Human, are you perhaps interested in witnessing the ancient Avgi sport of fencing, question?"`
	"CN-8290" `	"Fencing? Like the human sport?"`
	"CN-8291" `	"Sure, I'm willing to watch."`
	"CN-8292" `	The other, colored a bright blue and purple sheen, chimes in. "Assurance. While we as a species are unlikely to have preceded you in a sport such as this, I still implore you to attend."`
	"CN-8293" `	The first Avgi continues, "Addendum. Considering our... differences in agility, this will surely be a spectacle to you. Compared to the human sport, that is."`
	"CN-8294" `	"Sure, sounds like fun!"`
	"CN-8295" `	"I'll pass, thanks."`
	"CN-8296" `	A short walk later, you find yourself in a large open-air room, similar to a gymnasium but much taller. Rows of rails that look like they came from a skate park make up bleachers the whole way around the cylindrical area, packed to the brim with perched Avgi. Many are holding up signs with colorful lettering that appear to be in favor of one participant or the other.`
	"CN-8297" `	A short walk later, you find yourself in a large open-air room, similar to a gymnasium but much taller. Rows of rails that look like they came from a skate park make up bleachers the whole way around the cylindrical area, packed to the brim with perched Avgi. Many are holding up signs with colorful lettering that appear to be in favor of one participant or the other. One sign in particular states "ZOMP TO STOMP THEM LIKE THE ASSEMBLY!"`
	"CN-8298" `	Soon after, the familiar muted teal and glistening purple Avgi walk out of a small door on the bottom level. The spectators in the arena erupt with a flurry of wing flapping in what seems to be a loud cheer; your translator picks up "Excitement" and "Anticipation", among other moods, dozens of times. The fencers' wings appear to be kitted out with thin copper wires, and they're carrying the same rapiers you saw them with before. They hop up onto small pedestals located on each edge of the arena.`
	"CN-8299" `	A voice booms over the many speakers present in the room. "Proclamation. Here we have our reigning champion, Razmatazz, and the upstart challenger Zomp! Are you ready to witness this enthralling battle between these two paragons of the blade, question?"`
	"CN-8300" `	The arena once more hums to life with the flutter of wings. "Anticipation. Then let the duel... begin."`
	"CN-8301" `	At the announcer's word, the duelists leap into the air with incredible speed, circling around each other and clashing blades. The two spiral upwards into the far upper areas of the arena, and quickly drop back down, darting in and out of each others' reach multiple times per second. Less than a minute later, you hear a loud ding, and one of the duelists falls to the floor with their wing collapsed. The crowd, who hadn't stopped buzzing the entire duel, erupts with even louder wing fluttering.`
	"CN-8302" `	"Astonishment. Zomp wins round one," the announcer states. "Repose. Shall we begin round two?"`
	"CN-8303" `	Once more the contestants line up and spring into the air in a duel of eye-watering speed and agility. And once more, Zomp wins to the thunderous applause of the crowd.`
	"CN-8304" `	"Bewilderment. It seems as though Zomp has defeated our reigning champion!" the announcer proclaims.`
	"CN-8305" `	"Hysteria. I knew he would win! I'm up 10 to 1 on this bet!" a nearby Avgi says with exuberance as they buzz around you wildly, holding various pink papers in their many arms.`
	"CN-8306" `	Across the arena you hear a shout from a pink Avgi, "Adoration! I love you, Zomp!"`
	"CN-8307" `	The entire arena appears to be in a chaos of cheers, boos and rumbling wing flapping for minutes after the match has ended. You can't remember a single instance of fencing back in human space having this much passion and energy within the crowd.`
	"CN-8308" `	After the hubbub and celebration die down, you find no issue leaving the crowded arena - most Avgi simply fly over your head.`
	"CN-8309" `	You let the two fly away, continuing on your own business.`
	"CN-8310" `As you attempt to land, your sensors warn you of an approaching pod of Aberrant over the horizon, intent on destroying anything that approaches or tries to launch from <origin>. It seems you'll have to fight if you want to land here.`
	"CN-8311" `"Dejection. Once this star system was our own, but now we only hold the soil beneath our wings."`
	"CN-8312" `"Rejection. The Consonance claims to speak for the Avgi, yet none of us in the occupied systems voted for their rule."`
	"CN-8313" `"Remembrance. The Aberrations tried to bombard our cities early in the war, but our defense systems were able to shoot most of their projectiles down."`
	"CN-8314" `"Remembrance. Much of my family was lost when the Aberrant destroyed our cylinder habitats. In the Anax system, only the Nisos Cylinder survived."`
	"CN-8315" `"Guilt. Twelve million Avgi lived on each of the cylinder habitats. Less than one in six made it out alive."`
	"CN-8316" `"Worry. If not for our ground-to-orbit laser batteries, the Aberrant would surely have invaded the surface by now."`
	"CN-8317" `"Sorrow. You can see the debris from our shattered skyhooks in orbit with the naked eye."`
	"CN-8318" `"Anger. Why did the Consonance have to abandon our space? The surface of our core planets could have sheltered our ships, but instead they ran to save themselves."`
	"CN-8319" `"Curiosity. I've never been to the Tangled Shroud, but I heard it is a safe place away from the Aberrant."`
	"CN-8320" `"Satisfaction. Every time an Aberration comes too close, we hit it with half a dozen surface-to-orbit nuclear missiles."`
	"CN-8321" `"Optimism. Despite the siege of our star systems, the surface of our inhabited planets remain quite safe from attack."`
	"CN-8322" `"Relief. You wouldn't believe how hard it is to run a blockade against those Aberrant!"`
	"CN-8323" `"Frustration. We'd be able to smuggle more people out to the Tangled Shroud in the south if there was room to house them all."`
	"CN-8324" `"Appeasing. We can't take all of you with us, only these names on the list the Assembly gave us."`
	"CN-8325" `"Exasperation. No one understands that we can't just take everyone with us; there simply aren't enough habitats past the Shroud. The Consonance had to set an evacuation quota for a reason!"`
	"CN-8326" `"Frustration. We're always being asked to try and retrieve advanced equipment from the homeworlds, but it's simply too difficult to get it back to the Shroud."`
	"CN-8327" `"Wonder. I heard we could once travel the stars. Do you think we'll ever return?"`
	"CN-8328" `"Confusion. How is it that there are Avgi in other star systems, but we can't launch anything from this planet without it being destroyed?"`
	"CN-8329" `"Sadness. I don't know if I'll ever be able to visit another planet."`
	"CN-8330" `"Hurt. Why do the aliens attack us? We never did anything to them."`
	"CN-8331" `"Loss. I was born on a space station, but now I am trapped on a planet, weighed down by the ground itself."`
	"CN-8332" `"Despair. My family was lost in an Aberrant attack a year ago. It will never be the same again."`
	"CN-8333" `"Dejection. Reactor fuel grows in price each and every day."`
	"CN-8334" `"Relief. My ship barely made it to this port, ahead of a swarm of Aberrations!"`
	"CN-8335" `"Secrecy. The taxes levied by the Consonance can be evaded at certain ports, if one knows where to look."`
	"CN-8336" `"Defiance. I may not have a credit to my name, but no one will take my ship from me while I still live."`
	"CN-8337" `"Doubt. If the Aberrant could reach us inside the Tangled Shroud, they would have by now. I don't see why the new taxes are necessary."`
	"CN-8338" `"Irony. The only reason every freighter isn't automated these days is piracy. Thank you, pirates!"`
	"CN-8339" `"Intrigue. Did you hear about the new trade route through the Tangled Shroud? I smell profit!"`
	"CN-8340" `"Pride. My shipping company helped over a thousand Avgi escape Stilacrest before its skyhook was broken. I still get letters of gratitude to this day!"`
	"CN-8341" `"Satisfaction. My transport business escaped the Incursion with nearly all of its ships intact. Now I'm one of the richest Avgi in the galaxy!"`
	"CN-8342" `"Sadness. It's a shame we lose a convoy to the Aberrant nearly every week."`
	"CN-8343" `"Exasperation. Everyone in the Assembly knows the taxes and quotas are unpopular, but there's no other way to fight the war against the Aberrant."`
	"CN-8344" `"Pride. Before the Incursion, there were over a thousand recognized independent polities among the Avgi. Now, the Consonance is ready to unite our species."`
	"CN-8345" `"Mocking. Why of course, I never considered before that we should simply build more ships to defeat the Aberrant. Have you considered petitioning the Assembly with your idea?"`
	"CN-8346" `"Humor. Reaching a consensus among hundreds of independent polities is more difficult than fighting an existential war for the survival of your species. And less exciting."`
	"CN-8347" `"Reservation. While those of us who understand matters of policy accept that the war economy is necessary, the people are beginning to chafe under the long economic austerity it has imposed. More needs to be done to inform the common people lest we lose the war behind the front lines."`
	"CN-8348" `"Assurance. The current debts will surely not be enforced once the war ends. And if they are, we'll be the ones collecting them."`
	"CN-8349" `"Have you any reports of Aberrations in the Shroud, question?"`
	"CN-8350" `"Pensive. Sometimes I wonder at the future of our species, and whether we are up to the task of defending it."`
	"CN-8351" `"Resolve. The Guard is the only thing standing between our people and the Aberrant, and I intend to do my duty or die trying."`
	"CN-8352" `"Pride. Once I was a mere page on a courier ship, moving stacks of memory sheets between star systems. Look at me now!"`
	"CN-8353" `"Caution. `
	"CN-8354" `"Warning. `
	"CN-8355" `"Advisement. `
	"CN-8356" `"Diligence. `
	"CN-8357" `"Alert. `
	"CN-8358" `"Vigilance. `
	"CN-8359" `Large Aberration swarm reported to have entered the Tangled Shroud."`
	"CN-8360" `Missing convoy reported; suspected stranded in the Tangled Shroud."`
	"CN-8361" `Missing convoy reported; suspected lost in the Tangled Shroud."`
	"CN-8362" `Missing fleet reported; suspected stranded in the Tangled Shroud."`
	"CN-8363" `Missing fleet reported; suspected lost in the Tangled Shroud."`
	"CN-8364" `The defensive cordon at Arche is not impenetrable. Remain vigilant."`
	"CN-8365" `Report all Aberration sightings as soon as possible."`
	"CN-8366" `.`
	"CN-8367" `"Happiness. I'm about to graduate with my mastery in physics!"`
	"CN-8368" `"Happiness. I'm about to graduate with my mastery in economics!"`
	"CN-8369" `"Happiness. I'm about to graduate with my mastery in engineering!"`
	"CN-8370" `"Happiness. I'm about to graduate with my mastery in nanotechnology!"`
	"CN-8371" `"Happiness. I'm about to graduate with my mastery in genetics!"`
	"CN-8372" `"Happiness. I'm about to graduate with my mastery in aerodynamics!"`
	"CN-8373" `"Enthusiasm. I can't wait to go into academia after I graduate! I have a position lined up and everything!"`
	"CN-8374" `"Gratitude. The appearance of those humans got me the funding I needed to complete my xenology mastery. Thank you, humanity!"`
	"CN-8375" `"Joy. Midterms are finally over!"`
	"CN-8376" `"Have you seen my homework, question?"`
	"CN-8377" `"My professor refused to believe me when I said an Aberrant ate my homework, amusement."`
	"CN-8378" `"Annoyance. The quality of education out here just isn't the same as back on Aviskir."`
	"CN-8379" `"Annoyance. The quality of education out here just isn't the same as back on Livloua."`
	"CN-8380" `"Frustration. I wanted to study political science, but all they teach out here is 'practical' subjects. And people wonder why the Assembly is filled with incompetents..."`
	"CN-8381" `"Depression. I was going to study linguistics, but the university made me go into engineering instead. We already have enough engineers, what we need out here is culture!"`
	"CN-8382" `"Anger. I wanted to study the arts, but I was ridiculed and accused of being a dead weight on society. Well, a society without art is no society at all!"`
	"CN-8383" `"Anger. I wanted to study sociology, but that apparently isn't 'useful' to the War. Fools, the lot of them!"`
	"CN-8384" `"Worry. I hope I can find a good job once I'm out of school, but I might have to just work in the shipyards for a few years."`
	"CN-8385" `"Worry. I don't think I did well on that last exam."`
	"CN-8386" `"My professor refused to believe me when I said an Aberrant ate my homework, dejection."`
	"CN-8387" `"Gratitude. It is fortunate that the sum of our knowledge has been preserved, even in the most remote depths of space."`
	"CN-8388" `"Frustation. Energy shields should not work in the way they do. They make no sense!"`
	"CN-8389" `"Frustation. Even now, decades after we invented the hyperdrive, only a small group of experts can truly claim to understand the way it works."`
	"CN-8390" `"Pride. I did my thesis on a new type of solar cell junction. Now I see them on half the ships in the sky!"`
	"CN-8391" `"Amusement. You always see bright up-and-coming students claim to have invented a new kind of faster than light drive. Eighty years ago, one of them was actually right!"`
	"CN-8392" `"Curiosity. It's a wonder that once wormholes were considered the most likely option for traveling faster than light. I wonder how the hyperdrive was invented first?"`
	"CN-8393" `"Information. Our engineers created a type of coating that can greatly reduce a ship's atmospheric drag by causing shed vortices to destructively interfere with each other."`
	"CN-8394" `"Amazement. The simulations say that a memory diamond can retain its information for millions of years, if stored in stable conditions. That might outlast our entire civilization!"`
	"CN-8395" `"Instructive. The Twilight Nebula is a reflection nebula nearly a thousand light years wide. Illuminated by relatively young neutron stars, it is the remnants of multiple supernovae that occurred millions of years ago."`
	"CN-8396" `"Inquisitive. It is notable that the star cluster southeast of Stream is mostly made up of young, hot stars. That part of the Twilight nebula was likely once a dense molecular cloud, compact enough to collapse into giant stars millions of years ago."`
	"CN-8397" `"Tutelage. The Twilight Nebula is not in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is slowly contracting as it cools, a stellar nursery on a massive scale."`
	"CN-8398" `"Frustration. The galaxy is three-dimensional, but you wouldn't know it from the way everyone draws their maps!"`
	"CN-8399" `"Annoyance. Using cardinal directions like 'North' and 'West' to describe locations in the galaxy should be a crime! Polar coordinates for 'spinward' and 'rimward' would be far better."`
	"CN-8400" `"Curiosity. To this day, there is no explanation as to why some systems are linked by starways and others are not."`
	"CN-8401" `"Fascination. You would be surprised at how many problems shields, even weak ones, solve. They aren't only good for protecting against weapons fire!"`
	"CN-8402" `"Curiosity. I am told our current materials science is within an order of magnitude of the limits of the atomic bond strength, yet the Aberrant hulls are so much stronger than our own. How is that possible?"`
	"CN-8403" `"Amusement. We once thought our materials science was at the limit of what is possible with atomic matter. Then we met the Aberrant. What else do we have yet to learn?"`
	"CN-8404" `"Appreciation. Most people don't realize just how hard interstellar travel was before the hyperdrive."`
	"CN-8405" `"Advisement. You'd be surprised at how fast a fusion torch can wear out if you don't maintain it properly. Radiation is nasty business!"`
	"CN-8406" `"Appreciation. Before humans brought us energy shields, torchships had to be a lot more careful about where they pointed their engines!"`
	"CN-8407" `"Annoyance. Everyone should work in a machine shop at least once in their lives, before claiming a nanometer tolerance on a bolt is 'reasonable!'"`
	"CN-8408" `"Pride. I completed a new piece just the other day."`
	"CN-8409" `"Frustration. No one's in the market for art these days."`
	"CN-8410" `"Don't believe people who say art is a waste, emphasis. It's not like we're taking resources away from the War effort."`
	"CN-8411" `"Pride. I performed a piece just the other day in front of the entire Assembly. I'm sure they loved it!"`
	"CN-8412" `"Pride. The Twilight Guard loves to book me to entertain the Guards coming back from the front lines. It's good to know I'm doing my part."`
	"CN-8413" `"Satisfaction. You never know when one of the people who managed to buy their way out of the siege wants entertainment, but the paycheck makes it all worth it."`
	"CN-8414" `"Appreciation. The natural lifespan of an Avgi averaged about sixty years, before genetic engineering and nanomedicine more than doubled it."`
	"CN-8415" `"Amusement. The number of people who think medicytes can cure any disease or heal any condition grows every time a new version is released. If only they really worked that easily..."`
	"CN-8416" `"Fascination. Avgi have teardrop-shaped brains made of opaque quartz. The foggy color actually comes from organic tissue embedded in the crystal!"`
	"CN-8417" `"Interest. Some people used to believe that our brains could be revived after death, since the crystal they are made of remains intact. Sadly, the organic tissue that manipulates the crystal matrix to form memories decays shortly after death."`
	"CN-8418" `"Consideration. Despite our optical nervous system, organic nervous tissue is still used to modulate the conversion of optical signals to electrochemical ones at nerve interfaces."`
	"CN-8419" `"Consideration. Due to the high amount of ultraviolet light produced by Anax, our homeworld's star, life on Aviskir evolved to be more resilient against radiation damage."`
	"CN-8420" `"Recollection. I once worked on a freighter torchship, moving luxury goods around and making rush deliveries. I got very good at dealing with radiation sickness!"`
	"CN-8421" `"Recollection. I once worked at an asteroid manufactory, spinning asteroid nickelsteel out into cylinder habitats. We didn't have a serious industrial accident once in four years!"`

	"CN-8428" `As you explore the spaceport of <origin>, you come across a small grassy park, the greenspace a welcome contrast to the otherwise mechanical facilities. As the centerpiece of the park, where you'd expect a fountain or a statue in a human park, is a curious hanging windchime, made of pieces of colorful glass and various metals. It's more than a little mesmerizing, and you stop to listen as it rustles in the gentle circulation of the station's air.`
	"CN-8429" `	"Is this one of the humans I have heard so much about, question?" The translator tucked behind your ear suddenly speaks, responding to an Avgi voice. You turn and see an Avgi perched on a park bench behind you, his purple coloring faded with age. A board of colorful stones sits on the table in front of him, a game of some kind. He gives you an odd sort of salute with a forelimb, probably an Avgi greeting of some kind.`
	"CN-8430" `	"Hi, I'm Captain <first> <last>."`
	"CN-8431" `	"Courteous introduction. I am called Wisteria. Would you grace me with your own name?"`
	"CN-8432" `	"I'm Captain <first> <last>," you say.`
	"CN-8433" `	"Appreciated meeting. A pleasure to meet you, Captain <last>. Would you like to join old Wisteria at a game of Trefoil, question? I would be happy to teach you how to play, of course."`
	"CN-8434" `	"No thank you."`
	"CN-8435" `	"Delight. The youth these days have little appreciation for the art of Trefoil, you know." He taps one eye knowingly, an odd gesture. "Or at least my mother would say. That was sixty years ago, hmm. Please, sit, sit!" He points to the other side of his bench, with nothing more than a horizontal rail for a seat.`
	"CN-8436" `	"That sure looks comfortable."`
	"CN-8437" `	"I'll stand, I think."`
	"CN-8438" `	"Amusement. The other humans had chairs made to suit your forms, they did. Folded them up and carried them everywhere."`
	"CN-8439" `	"Did you meet them?" you ask.`
	"CN-8440" `	"Yes, yes. Several times. Only the angry one was any good at Trefoil, sadly. Speaking of which-" He deftly rearranges the colored stones, arranging them into a neat pattern: three triangles, one of each color, angled with their topmost points touching at the center of a six-sided board.`
	"CN-8441" `	"Respectful deference. Which color would you like to play as, question? There is no real difference between them, as far as the game plays."`
	"CN-8442" `	"Red."`
	"CN-8443" `	"Blue."`
	"CN-8444" `	"Acknowledgment. Excellent. Explanation. The objective is to remove all of your pieces from the board by moving them to the opposite edge to your own triangle." Demonstrating with a stone, he shows you how to skip it over connected chains of other pieces, moving to their endpoint. "You must balance your moves between freeing your own pieces and blocking the other colors from their own escape."`
	"CN-8445" `	You delicately take a seat on the rail. It's at least only a little worse than a park bench, and you're thankful for the lower gravity on Peripheria.`
	"CN-8446" `	"But there's three sides and only two of us."`
	"CN-8447" `	"Approving. An astute observation. The third color can be played by a third person, in some variations, but in our case we take turns moving for it. It - the Foil - is an external actor, under our influence yet outside our absolute control, often used as a pawn to block the other player's moves when opportune. Now, would you like to make the first move, question? Players generally either focus on either evacuating their own pieces or moving to block their opponent's path to escape."`
	"CN-8448" `	(Focus on getting my stones out. Move a stone towards my color's escape.)`
	"CN-8449" `	(Focus on blocking Wisteria. Move a stone towards his triangle.)`
	"CN-8450" `	(Focus on blocking the Foil. Move a stone towards its triangle.)`
	"CN-8451" `	"Approving. A good approach. That is the classical move to make at the start of the game, especially for a beginner."`
	"CN-8452" `	"Amusement. Ah, already moving to block me, I see. That is often an approach taken by more advanced players, but I must warn you, executing it successfully is difficult."`
	"CN-8453" `	"Interest. I do not often see players prioritize blocking the Foil, especially as their first move. But perhaps you will surprise me."`
	"CN-8454" `	Slightly adjusting his position on the bench, the Avgi continues. "Now, after each of our turns, we shall move one of the Foil's pieces. You should focus on moving them to your advantage, whether that be by blocking my pieces or keeping them out of the way of your own."`
	"CN-8455" `	(Move one of the Foil's stones towards my own side, to start building a link.)`
	"CN-8456" `	(Move one of the Foil's stones towards Wisteria's side, to block him in the future.)`
	"CN-8457" `	(Move one of the Foil's stones towards its own exit. Why not?)`
	"CN-8458" `	"Approving. A wise approach, to prepare to build bridges in the future. It is more complex, and can be difficult, but is often well-rewarded in the end. Of course, you must take care not to accidentally box yourself in, and create a chain that lacks endpoints closer to your exit."`
	"CN-8459" `	"Interest. It is a good move, to try and build a wall I cannot jump over, but you must take care not to accidentally create a chain with an endpoint placed to my advantage."`
	"CN-8460" `	"Surprise. I have not seen that done before. The Foil cannot win, of course, so you have nothing to gain by removing its pieces from the board aside from denying them to the opposing player."`
	"CN-8461" `	Wisteria studies the board for a brief moment before moving one of his pieces towards his exit, then quickly moving a Foil piece towards his triangle. "Curiosity. I must confess, I wonder what our civilization looks like to an outsider, in the state it is in."`
	"CN-8462" `	"It's impressive that you've been able to keep on fighting, even out here."`
	"CN-8463" `	"It seems like everyone lives a hard life out here."`
	"CN-8464" `	"I don't think I've seen enough of it to say anything, to be honest."`
	"CN-8465" `	"Contemplation. Yes. Fighting. A vice we have never quite been able to escape, and yet some would say we should be grateful for that now. For without the long millennia to sharpen the spear of war, how much worse would we have fared against the Aberrant, question? And yet my old bones grow weary with every failed expedition to reclaim Aviskir, and I hear the voices crying out that enough is enough, and to give up on our old worlds and build a new life out here."`
	"CN-8466" `	"Agreement. Yes, we do, and it grows harder the longer our war with the Aberrant goes on. We build our defenses up and they knock them down, we send armadas to retake Aviskir and they are routed or never return. It seems that all of our energies must go into this war, and little of our wealth is spent elsewhere. It is little wonder that some say we should seek to truly build a new life here, rather than waste our lives and efforts on reclaiming the old."`
	"CN-8467" `	"Amusement. Fair to say, as I suppose the perspective of an outsider must be more confused than enlightened, when confronted with a new species, a new civilization, for the first time. And I suppose you have seen little of our true civilization, the planets we left to the Aberrant."`
	"CN-8468" `	"Regardless, I wonder what you would think of us, had you arrived before the Aberrant threw us from our homes. Conflict. It is almost a shame to me that you have to see us in our current state, but then I think of the unity and selflessness that we have found in each other, and that fills me with pride."`
	"CN-8469" `	You play a few more rounds back and forth, each of you advancing towards your respective exits. It is once more your turn.`
	"CN-8470" `	(Move a stone towards my escape.)`
	"CN-8471" `	(Move a new stone towards my escape.)`
	"CN-8472" `	(Move my stone further towards my escape.)`
	"CN-8473" `	(Prepare to block Wisteria. Move a stone towards his triangle.)`
	"CN-8474" `	(Further block Wisteria. Move a new stone towards his side)`
	"CN-8475" `	(Move my blocking stone further towards Wisteria's side)`
	"CN-8476" `	(Move a stone towards the Foil triangle. Why not?)`
	"CN-8477" `	"Approving. Balancing your movements between hindering me and evacuating your own pieces is the key to victory, and keeping multiple pieces in play is critical to achieving that balance."`
	"CN-8478" `	"Consideration. You are focused on escape, with no inclination towards hindering me. A good strategy for the first few moves, but winning almost always requires some form of interference with the other side, even if it means entangling your pieces in defensive formations."`
	"CN-8479" `	"Consideration. You are focused on fleeing with that single piece, without having moved your other pieces. A good strategy for the first few moves if your goal is to set up a formation for use later, but you must be careful to avoid leaving the rest of your pieces behind."`
	"CN-8480" `	"Approving. Balancing your movements between hindering me and evacuating your own pieces is the key to victory, and keeping multiple pieces in play is critical to achieving that balance, especially as you may use your pieces to skip towards me."`
	"CN-8481" `	"Approving. Your efforts thus far are focused on reacting to me, but you are making good use of multiple pieces that may later be arranged into a wall."`
	"CN-8482" `	"Consideration. Your efforts thus far are focused on reacting to me, but you should keep in mind that a single stone will not do much to block me, and may in fact be exploited to form a chain for my own use, should you not use your own pieces to constrain its endpoint."`
	"CN-8483" `	"Bemusement. I am not sure if you are tricking me with some plan, but that is certainly an unusual move."`
	"CN-8484" `	Wisteria quickly completes his own move, as well as his movement of the Foil. Now he seems to be moving a piece in your direction, perhaps to block you. After a few more back-and-forth moves between the two of you, he asks you another question.`
	"CN-8485" `	"So, Captain <last>. I am curious. If you found yourself in our place, an invincible enemy placed between yourself, armed with the last dregs of your people's spacefaring strength, and the bulk of your people held hostage on their very planets but otherwise unharmed, what would you do, question? Would you abandon them to their fate to build a new life out amongst the stars, or gamble your remaining strength on a bet to liberate them?"`
	"CN-8486" `	"You can't just abandon everyone on your planets. Surely there's a way to win against the Aberrant, even if it takes sacrifice."`
	"CN-8487" `	"If the Aberrant aren't attacking the surfaces of the Avgi worlds, maybe you should focus on making life better out here first. After all, you have people out here to take care of too."`
	"CN-8488" `	"I would find another way. Communicating with the Aberrant maybe, or finding a way to both fight the war and help the people out here."`
	"CN-8489" `	"Appreciation. Such is the opinion of most of us, those who feel lucky to have escaped in the first place and feel a certain obligation to help the rest of our people. But the way forward is unclear. If we build our strength, our military might, perhaps we will have a chance in the future to truly drive the Aberrant from our homes, but just how far we can drive the free Avgi of the Consonance, I do not know. Perhaps it will break us, and leave us with no victory at all."`
	"CN-8490" `	"Contemplation. That view would have been anathema to us only a short few years ago, but it is one that is steadily gaining ground. With each defeat and failed expedition back to the Twilight, the calls grow to focus on preserving what we have, not reaching to reclaim the old. And many say that those on the old worlds are safe, for now, and may even be able to build a fleet to liberate themselves, if they can but reclaim their orbital shipyards and asteroid mines. If that truly is the case, they say, then we should build ourselves up as a bastion first, with the living space and abundance to support our population."`
	"CN-8491" `	"Amusement. Always in search of another way, everyone is. Perhaps because the choice we are left with is so abhorrent, that seeking another way provides a means of relieving them of it. We have attempted communication with the Aberrant, to no avail, and it seems likely they are not an intelligent species to begin with. They do not appear to coordinate with each other, and examining their debris in the rare instances we have managed to destroy one reveals no crew, just a strange mixture of machine and flesh. Perhaps they are some forgotten living weapon, engineered by a race long gone, or the mere servants of some ancient race far beyond us in power, the equivalents of our mining drones and service robots."`
	"CN-8492" `	He splays his arms. "But no, a choice must be made in the end, even if it is only one of degree. Even should we attempt to both build new homes in the Outer Limits and protract our conflict with the Aberrant, the resources allocated to each still remain to be divided up. And there, the conflict between the Consonance and Dissonance lies."`
	"CN-8493" `	You play a few more rounds with Wisteria, and he shows you how to set up chains of pieces that can be used to skip ahead, while also denying their use to the enemy. After a particularly interesting set of moves, where he demonstrates how to break a chain and add your own endpoints to it, the conversation once more turns to politics.`
	"CN-8494" `	"Curiosity. I am reminded, Captain <last>, that you likely do not know much of our system of government in the first place. Am I right in this, question?"`
	"CN-8495" `	"I think I know a little."`
	"CN-8496" `	"Yeah, I don't know much aside from there being an Assembly that you vote in."`
	"CN-8497" `	"Consideration. I see. It is something that should be rectified, then, to make your time among us less confusing. The first thing that you should know is that the Avgi are not, nor have ever been, united under a single government."`
	"CN-8498" `	"Explanation. The Assembly of Polities, as it is formally named, is a rather complicated institution. As its name suggests, it is, well, an assembly of polities. Polities being... associations, or identities. I have read of your human histories, and you could perhaps consider them an analog of nations, but with two key differences."`
	"CN-8499" `	Wisteria raises a sharp finger. "One, they are not geographically bounded. Oh, many will perhaps have ownership over various pieces of land and space stations, but that is in constant flux, and they are rarely joined into a contiguous whole. And two, an individual Avgi can belong to any number of polities at the same time. Citizenship, you may think of it, is shared - and diluted - between as many polities as an Avgi wishes to belong to. Religion, ethnic heritage, economic sector, and even common interests are the most common lines by which polities might base themselves around, but there is one for almost any group imaginable. Even major corporations, or industries that have banded together."`
	"CN-8500" `	He spreads his arms out as if presenting a great circle. "The Assembly was an attempt at securing harmony between these polities, to prevent conflicts, and when that became impossible, to set the rules and limits of war. One representative, an Elector, per polity, with a vote weighted by the number of Avgi belonging to it, and by how those Avgi had chosen to dilute their own membership among the various polities. And from they select three Speakers, a Trirumvirate to lead the leaders."`
	"CN-8501" `	"Do the Avgi in a polity elect their Elector?"`
	"CN-8502" `	"Corporations are part of the government? I've seen that one before."`
	"CN-8503" `	He shrugs, an oddly human gesture. "It depends. Many polities do not even elect their own leadership, and they are free to select their representative however they wish. For some it is an elected position, for others it is one appointed by their leadership. A few even have their head of government serve as their Elector, though that is quite the time commitment to make."`
	"CN-8504" `	Wisteria looks up. "But yes, most of the polities use some form of democracy. An Avgi might find themselves voting in several elections, one for each polity they claim membership to, with their vote diluted by how many polities they belong to."`
	"CN-8505" `	Wisteria thrums in laughter. "Amusement. Yes, I've heard of your Syndicate. It was strange to me, to hear of a corporation that wished for the burden of true governance, instead of leaving that to your Republic. It seems to me that the industrial polities here try their best to avoid any responsibility, while still reaping the benefits of representation."`
	"CN-8506" `	"Amusement. And of course there are internal factions within the Assembly, as likeminded polities work together to advance their agendas, then just as quickly abandon each other. A harsh world, the Assembly is."`
	"CN-8507" `	"What factions are there in the Assembly?"`
	"CN-8508" `	"They're all that ruthless, even now?"`
	"CN-8509" `	Wisteria laughs. "Of course they are. Oh, most of them have the same goal in the end, defeating the Aberrant, but there are many who are convinced that their methods are best suited for achieving that goal."`
	"CN-8510" `	He ticks them off on his pointed fingers, three on each hand. "There are the Centralists, those from the smaller polities who wish to see the Consonance grow in authority and power. The war against the Aberrant demands strong leaders, they say, and many agree with them." He tilts his head to the left.`
	"CN-8511" `	"The Technocrats, they disdain that, and place their hopes in a qualitative solution to defeat the Aberrant. Build better ships and give them better weapons, and the Aberrant can be swept from the Twilight without the need to demand ever more resources from our people. They draw from many of the industrialist polities, but their loyalties are often divided," he says as he makes a move.`
	"CN-8512" `	"The Financiers, the old money types with their fingers in everything, they represented many of the more urbanized regions of the core worlds, and their influence has come with them. Disdained by everyone in public, and beloved by all who would seek to benefit from their influence, I would credit them for being half the reason for the present unity between polities that would normally refuse to cooperate with each other," he says with an amused flick of his wings.`
	"CN-8513" `	"There are more, of course, with lesser influence. The Nationalists, who resent the decline of their polities' power, and especially the subsumption of their militaries into the Twilight Guard, are an ever-present thorn in the side of the Centralists, but they at least are quick to point out authoritarianism when they see it. The Ecologists want but a single thing, the complete settlement of Weledos, and the refocusing of resources on colonization and construction rather than shipbuilding. And there is a loose coalition, the Freelancers, who agree on nothing except that taxes and price controls should be relaxed."`
	"CN-8514" `	He sits back. "And of course the Twilight Guard is its own faction, as much as they will emphasize their neutrality. They have their supporters and detractors, but none can oppose them entirely, for they are all that stands between us and the Aberrant."`
	"CN-8515" `	With that, he deftly moves a Foil piece, trapping a cluster of your stones behind a wall.`
	"CN-8516" `	(Try to break the wall and turn it into a chain.)`
	"CN-8517" `	(Evacuate my other stones.)`
	"CN-8518" `	(Retaliate by trapping the rest of Wisteria's stones.)`
	"CN-8519" `	"Approving. Excellent, you have broken my blockade and turned it to your advantage instead. A good skill for an experienced player to have."`
	"CN-8520" `	"Instructing. Ah, you see how you were unable to break the blockade, question? Your formation was not organized well enough for it with the stones you have available, and you would have been better served by ignoring those pieces and making moves elsewhere."`
	"CN-8521" `	"Interest. You seem to be abandoning the pieces I have trapped in order to move the rest while I am distracted. A clever strategy, and one that is non-obvious."`
	"CN-8522" `	"Approving. Instead of trying to break my blockade, which would be difficult, you choose to instead take the opportunity to block in my own pieces, which forces me to respond."`
	"CN-8523" `	You play a few more rounds, each of you managing to take a few of your pieces off the board.`
	"CN-8524" `	"So, what was it like before the Aberrant came?"`
	"CN-8525" `	"What about the Dissonance? I've heard of them."`
	"CN-8526" `	"Contemplation. Perhaps a better question would be, 'what it was like before the hyperdrive?' For our society was not placed into turmoil first by the Aberrant, but rather by the discovery of a means to travel faster than light. Inside a handful of years an outlandish physics experiment went from theory to reality, and stars that had been decades or centuries away instead became reachable in first months, then weeks, then days as the hyperdrive continued to improve."`
	"CN-8527" `	He leans in. "You must understand, emphasis, just how economically separated the various pockets of Avgi civilization were. Aviskir of course was dominant within the Anax system, but beyond interplanetary politics practically every system was independent in both a political and economic sense. There was no Consonance to organize the various powers, and everyone largely kept to themselves by sheer virtue of the distance and expense involved in interstellar travel."`
	"CN-8528" `	Wisteria spreads his arms as if to encompass the entire station. "Then, almost overnight, the situation went from one of extreme separation to one of interconnection. The fleets of vast starships, powered by stores of antimatter or immense lasers, became obsolete, and it suddenly became possible for even moderately well-off individuals to travel between the stars."`
	"CN-8529" `	"Were there wars?"`
	"CN-8530" `	"Did you colonize new planets?"`
	"CN-8531" `	"Remembrance. Oh, but of course. Only three or four systems, depending on how you count it, were truly colonized before the hyperdrive. There were expeditions sent to more, but they all either failed or remained insignificant up until hyperdrive-equipped ships joined them. We colonized an additional trio of systems, and explored dozens more."`
	"CN-8532" `	"Remembrance. Some, yes, though not as many as you might expect of us. A few powers on Aviskir tried to seize weaker colonies once they gained access to hyperdrives, but they overestimated their ability to wage war between the stars. It was years before the first truly capable interstellar warships were built, and by then the situation had stabilized enough that there were few polities interested in starting a new war."`
	"CN-8533" `	"But the true consequence was the creation of the Consonance. With Avgi civilization once more connected, there was a vision of a grand forum of each and every polity, a united Avgi civilization, at least in name."`
	"CN-8534" `	"Caution. Ah. Our wayward cousins. As much as some fearmongers would have you believe, the Dissonance is neither a rival government nor a subversive movement. Rather, they are a collection of those dissatisfied with the Consonance and the Assembly. Their reasons and motivations vary, but their most significant common grievance is the control over prices enforced by the Consonance as they appropriate resources for use by the Twilight Guard. That, and the taxes the Assembly attempts to levy without much success, has turned many against the Consonance, and those polities who fly Dissonance colors reject any allegiance to the Consonance."`
	"CN-8535" `	"But don't they know the Twilight Guard is needed to fight the Aberrant? Without them, they'd all be killed."`
	"CN-8536" `	"That seems too simple. That can't be their only reason for leaving the Consonance, not in an existential war."`
	"CN-8537" `	"Approving. That is an astute observation, and one you are correct in. It is of course more complicated than a simple disdain for taxation and price controls. There is the matter of sovereignty, the continued decline of the power of the polities as the Consonance takes on additional responsibilities. Many of the polities that created the Consonance no longer exist, and even more are nothing more than a collection of refugees, the bulk of which sleep in cryogenic storage, waiting for us to build the habitable space needed to awaken them. Many resent this, remembering the days of freedom and true independence, and the rejection of Consonance authority is one way to revisit those days."`
	"CN-8538" `	He turns his head to the side. "Sadness. I cannot say I blame them. They are correct in that the Assembly does grow ever more overbearing, and the fear of more polities leaving the Consonance has served as a check on the tendency for the Assembly to grant itself ever more powers."`
	"CN-8539" `	"Ah, but is that really the case, question? Many of them would argue that we may simply hide within the Tangled Shroud, or instead dedicate our efforts to fortifying a single system at their entrance. Others oppose not the existence of the Twilight Guard, but rather their continued failed forays back into the Twilight, which they see as a waste of both resources and lives."`
	"CN-8540" `	"But I see we approach the end of our game. I can spot a path to victory for myself, but can you, question? I assure you that one exists."`
	"CN-8541" `(Focus on getting the rest of my stones out as quickly as possible.)`
	"CN-8542" `(Evacuate the stones I have blocking Wisteria.)`
	"CN-8543" `(Try to completely block Wisteria in with my remaining stones before extracting them.)`
	"CN-8544" `(Try to completely block Wisteria in with the Foil's stones.)`
	"CN-8545" `(Try to undo the blockades Wisteria has created for me with the Foil's stones.)`
	"CN-8546" `	"Approving. An excellent prioritization of your own pieces."`
	"CN-8547" `	"Approving. An excellent blocking action, one that has delayed me."`
	"CN-8548" `	"Approving. An excellent blocking action, one that has delayed me without costing you anything."`
	"CN-8549" `	In the end Wisteria is able to pull ahead and get the last of his pieces off the board before you, and you suspect it was only as close as it was due to him humoring you.`
	"CN-8550" `	You play with bated breath as your pieces slowly inch off the board, until at last victory is yours, a scant single move before Wisteria would have evacuated his final piece. You suspect that while he has given you a fair game, he has perhaps gone easy on you to give you a chance to win.`
	"CN-8551" `	"Satisfaction. A fine game, Captain <first>," he says, congratulating you. "You are a talented player, and I much enjoyed our conversation during the game." You realize that hours have gone by since you started, with the station's lights simulating a ruddy sunset.`
	"CN-8552" `	"Appreciation. Allow me to gift you this Trefoil board, so that you might enjoy the game in your own time. I look forward to meeting you in the future, and perhaps we may even have the chance to play again."`
	"CN-8553" `	He gently hands you the Trefoil board, bows in respect, then climbs off his rail to depart. "Should you ever wish to speak to me again, ask for the office of former Speaker Wisteria and I will be more than pleased to host you."`
	"CN-8554" `	"Thank you," you say, and it is only after he has left that you realize Wisteria must have been not just an Elector, but one of the First Speakers at some point in the past.`
	"CN-8555" `You are on your way back to the <ship> after a stroll through the spaceport when a bright yellow Avgi lands in front of you. "Hey, you! Enthusiasm! I am Nikkio, famed medician and traveling salesman. Do you, alien sojourner, care for your health?"`
	"CN-8556" `	"I guess so."`
	"CN-8557" `	"Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested."`
	"CN-8558" `	You try to step around him and continue on your way, but he mirrors you, dancing backwards to remain in your face. "Sincerity! You are making a terrible mistake! I have something that could help with your energy, yes?"`
	"CN-8559" `	"Alright, alright. What is it?"`
	"CN-8560" `	"Not interested. Now move before I call the authorities."`
	"CN-8561" `	"Excitement! Wonderful! I have just the thing, certified by the Consonance Health Committee itself, surely!" he says animatedly, arms and wings waving as he dances in front of you. "But, reservation. Hmm. Only the most enterprising of captains could benefit from what I am about to bestow upon you. Are you certain you have what it takes to try Zapchannel Ray Energy?"`
	"CN-8562" `	"Yes, I'm very experienced, seen the galaxy and all. Now show me what you're talking about."`
	"CN-8563" `	"Alright, that's it. Get out of here before I call the authorities."`
	"CN-8564" `	"Excitement, excellent! I can see you are clearly a very intelligent and discerning captain. Anticipation. This serum was invented by yours truly, capable of resolving all of your worldly woes! Only 3,000 credits!" He proudly holds out a vial of cloudy white liquid, glowing a bright, intense pale blue.`
	"CN-8565" `	"Uh, what is this?"`
	"CN-8566" `	"Is this radioactive?"`
	"CN-8567" `	"I'm not drinking that."`
	"CN-8568" `	"Dismissal. Nonsense, this formula is perfectly safe! A serum for the health, proven to kill over three thousand forms of cancer, you should know." As if on cue, the glow pulses menacingly.`
	"CN-8569" `	"Yeah, that doesn't look safe. I'm calling the authorities."`
	"CN-8570" `	"Alright, I'll give it a shot."`
	"CN-8571" `	You take the vial, warm to the touch, and uncork it. Nikkio gives you an expectant look, and gestures at you before you carefully tip the drink back. You feel a little tingly as the drink trickles down your throat, tasting vaguely of lemon and metal. This quickly intensifies into pins and needles in your chest, spreading as your body starts to go numb. As your vision darkens, punctuated by flashes of light in the corners of your eyes, your last thought is that perhaps you shouldn't have drunk a mysterious glowing liquid given to you by a seedy alien you just met in the spaceport.`
	"CN-8572" `	You take the vial, warm to the touch, and uncork it before carefully tipping it back. You feel a little tingly as the drink trickles down your throat, tasting vaguely of lemon and metal. This quickly intensifies into pins and needles in your chest, spreading as you start to feel somehow revitalized. After a brief, sharp pain, a suspiciously dragonfly-shaped patch of skin in the center of your chest begins to glow a vibrant blue.`
	"CN-8573" `	"Surprise. You surely are, ah, a worthy captain!" says Nikkio, shock evident on his face. He begins to sidle away, glancing in all directions as though he isn't sure what's going on. "Hurry. I must be on my way, goodbye for now, captain!"`
	"CN-8574" `	"Alarm. There's no need for that, apologies, apologies! Be on your way, Captain!"`
	"CN-8575" `You are struck by just how massive this space station is, even in its incomplete state. At three kilometers in diameter, it is only a small fraction of the size of the cylinders back in the Twilight, but even so it overshadows any human orbital construction. The site is an active construction zone, based on what you've heard, though you see little evidence of activity. A few Avgi lounge about in the small, temporary living quarters for the construction workers, but all of the Akoustiki Excursion Vehicles with their welding arms and nanofilament spinners are docked and powered down.`
	"CN-8576" `	Would you like to ask what's going on?`
	"CN-8577" `	You find a deep yellow Avgi, dressed in metallic blue-colored bangles around his limbs and forward body, perched in a makeshift office behind a pile of boxes. "Hey, do you mind if I ask some questions about this station?" you say.`
	"CN-8578" `	"Curiosity. Of course, alien traveler," he says, waving an arm at you. "My name is Gamboge, and I direct the construction effort on the Aktina Cylinder. What would you like to know?"`
	"CN-8579" `	"How long until the cylinder is done?"`
	"CN-8580" `	"What kind of station design is this?"`
	"CN-8581" `	"What are you building this station for?"`
	"CN-8582" `	"That's all the questions I have, thank you."`
	"CN-8583" `	He thrums with laughter. "The trillion credit question, is it not, amusement? The answer I give the Assembly is that it will be finished when they supply us with the requisite materials and workforce to do so. But the War takes precedence, as it must, and so the steel and nanofibers and ceramics that we must have before we can fill this cylinder with atmosphere are instead used to build warships, and the engineers and workers with any shred of experience are sent to the Navigeo Yards instead of here."`
	"CN-8584" `	"Well, it makes sense that fighting the Aberrant would take priority."`
	"CN-8585" `	"Is building this station as important as fighting the Aberrant?"`
	"CN-8586" `	"Clarification. By no means do I begrudge the Assembly's decision. Without the Twilight Guard I would not be alive to complain about being paid to sit around all day, though that burden truly does pain me. But when I am asked by important delegates and electors why there is not yet an abundance of space with which to house their people, I am obliged to tell them that the decision rests with them, not with me."`
	"CN-8587" `	"A Class Two rotating cylinder habitat. Unless you use the Hekkedian classification system, in which case it is a Type One orbital habitat station. Of course, the Freosi would call it a Lieno-Drareg Cylinder, but that name hasn't been fashionable in quite some time."`
	"CN-8588" `	"I was more asking about what it'll look like when it's done," you say.`
	"CN-8589" `	"Amusement. I know, I know, I was just messing with you." He gestures out the window towards the steel skeleton of the unfinished station. "Six kilometers wide and twelve long, with two-hundred-sixty-six ribs of nickel-iron roidsteel and ninety spinal columns of carbon nanofilament. Once the base frame is complete, and it very nearly is, we will begin plating it with sheets of aerogel and graphene, with a fluorinated polymer layer coating the inside. After that my job is done, and we hand the project over to the ecosystem engineers."`
	"CN-8590" `	"What do they do?"`
	"CN-8591" `	"That sounds like a lot."`
	"CN-8592" `	"Appreciation. Oh, it is. Over seven hundred megatons of raw material, scraped off moons and torn from asteroids. But it will be worth it, in the end.`
	"CN-8593" `	"Of course, the entire purpose of this is to provide enough living space for the Avgi who escaped the Aberrant. And everyone would rather live in an open environment, instead of pretending a garden in a smaller station is sufficient. Thus, the ecosystem engineers come in with their millions of tons of soil to dirty up our nice shiny metal and nanofilaments, and grow grass and trees and fungus to make this place a little less dreary. I suppose we'll make most of the soil in bulk from crushed carbonaceous asteroids, and seed it with whatever samples we have from Aviskir."`
	"CN-8594" `	"Consideration. A place to live, with enough space to be a real home, not just a temporary outpost with a few houseplants. You should know, we had thousands of cylinders far larger than this one back in Anax and around our other colonies. Billions of Avgi, housed not on planets but in space. This is but a pale imitation of what we once had, but it is needed all the same. Do you know the most pressing question faced by the Assembly?"`
	"CN-8595" `	"What would that be?"`
	"CN-8596" `	"Mild surprise. It is oft spoken of. The Assembly must decide the fate of the millions of Avgi in cryogenic storage, frozen during our evacuation to facilitate their transportation. A scarce few thousand are thawed every year, the best and brightest we can find among them woken to fight the Aberrant, all because we lack the food and living space to support the rest. This cylinder here, Aktina, could support them."`
	"CN-8597" `	"Appreciation. I was happy to answer them. Though, if I might ask a favor?"`
	"CN-8598" `	"I don't have time for anything, sorry."`
	"CN-8599" `	"I hope I have impressed the importance of this project upon you. But, despite the scale of the resources required to truly complete it, we do not need an unreasonable amount to continue construction on the most essential elements. As a starship captain, independent of the requisitions and allocations of the Consonance, would you be willing to assist us in gathering the materials we need?"`
	"CN-8600" `	"For the right pay."`
	"CN-8601" `	"Sorry, no."`
	"CN-8602" `	"Gratitude. I will ensure there are items posted on nearby job boards that you might gather and transport here."`
	"CN-8603" `While admiring the ships in <origin>'s spaceport, you notice a Polari painted in civilian Avgi colors, rather than usual deep blue of the Twilight Guard. All of the scouts you've seen before have been commissioned ships of the Guard, but it seems like this one might be privately owned.`
	"CN-8604" `	(Ask around about who the Polari belongs to.)`
	"CN-8605" `	(It's not that interesting. I have better things to do.)`
	"CN-8606" `	You ask a few passing Avgi, and eventually one is able to answer your question.`
	"CN-8607" `	"Probably an infocourier ship, hauling information and databases instead of cargo. The Guard sometimes sends ships to market if they've taken a beating and aren't worth fixing up to combat standards, which is probably what happened there."`
	"CN-8608" `	You thank the Avgi for their time, and are about to leave when you spot a pale yellow Avgi climbing on board the exact ship you've been talking about. You might as well see if he's willing to chat.`
	"CN-8609" `	"Hey, do you have a moment?" you ask as you jog over.`
	"CN-8610" `	The Avgi looks down from atop the Polari. "Invitation, I do. The name's Hansa, and you are?"`
	"CN-8611" `	"Captain <first> <last>," you say. "Are you one of the infocouriers?"`
	"CN-8612" `	Hansa clicks his arms together. "Mild surprise. Indeed I am, but I'm surprised you've heard of us. Not a lot of people talk about the courier system these days."`
	"CN-8613" `	"Why is that?"`
	"CN-8614" `	"What do couriers do?"`
	"CN-8615" `	"Hmm. Consideration. Decades ago, before the hyperdrive, the arrival of an interstellar courier ship would be a cause for celeberation. Entire planets would rejoice to receive news of the sciences and arts of other stars, which were cherished. You see, interstellar visits were rare during those days, only a few times a year at most. There was remote communication, of course, with bright x-ray lasers and telescopes to receive them, but the transfer rates were too slow for information to be shared in bulk."`
	"CN-8616" `	Hansa flicks his wings. "A good courier ship might have been less than half as fast as a laser operating at the speed of light, but it could move a thousandfold more information in the same time nonetheless. And a courier ship could carry all the information produced by an entire system's worth of people in a decade, and share it with the neighboring systems so they could update their own databases. Those were the days," he says wistfully.`
	"CN-8617" `	"What changed?"`
	"CN-8618" `	Hansa sighs, making an odd whistling sound. "Nostalgia. Interstellar travel is much easier these days. Gone are the kilometer-long starships, the petawatt beam-pushers. I'm not complaining about it, of course - it is impossible to overstate just how incredible the hyperdrive has been. Now that interstellar journeys take days instead of decades, the courier system has adapted, and now it is just that - a system. Regular. Predictable. And ultimately unexciting." He looks a bit dejected.`
	"CN-8619" `	"Today, we make the rounds in ships that are fast, but have the room for enough storage media to update a planet's entire network. In our heyday, before the Incursion, a courier ship would visit a world every day to upload its database, but since then we've struggled to keep each system controlled by the Consonance updated once per week."`
	"CN-8620" `	"Why use a Polari? Aren't those scout ships?"`
	"CN-8621" `	"How can you update an entire planetary network with one courier ship?"`
	"CN-8622" `	"Sounds like an interesting job. Is there any way I could take infocourier missions?"`
	"CN-8623" `	"Consideration. Many reasons, some of which are even good ones. Mostly because what makes them excellent research and scout vessels also makes them excellent courier ships - fast, while also having large integrated memory banks and a reasonable amount of space for cargo. It helps that the Twilight Guard has been decommissioning so many Polari lately, with how fragile they are against the Aberrant. Anticipation. It wouldn't surprise me if they designed a successor to them, if you ask me."`
	"CN-8624" `	"Explanation. Incredibly dense storage media, of course: memory diamond, we call it. You can find it under a dozen trade names, each claiming to be better than the last, but they're really all the same stuff, more or less. Chains of alternating carbon-12 and carbon-13, printed out as a diamond by specialized nanofabricators. The stuff is incredibly resilient, chemically stable, and will keep information archived practically forever. Just keep it away from radiation and high heat, which diamond doesn't stand up to well."`
	"CN-8625" `	He twitches his wings. "Amusement. Of course, don't be expecting data crystals or glowing gemstones like you see in science fiction. Most of the time it comes in matte black bricks or slabs, nothing flashy."`
	"CN-8626" `	"Consideration. With a fast ship, anyone trusted enough to haul a few dozen tons of memory diamond can do the job. In fact, I can make a few calls and see about expediting the process for you, if you'd like."`
	"CN-8627" `	"Yes, I'd like that."`
	"CN-8628" `	"How much are you normally paid for ferrying information?"`
	"CN-8629" `	Hansa laughs. "Too much, if you ask anyone else. The Assembly recognizes how critical it is to maintain lines of communication, especially now, with the War, so we haven't suffered nearly as much as most. Amusement. It would be rare indeed to find a captain that would turn down a courier job, but a ship has to be fast and willing to drop everything to rush to a particular system as often as possible, with little time for breaks. Does that sound like the kind of job for you?"`
	"CN-8630" `	"I think I'm interested."`
	"CN-8631" `	"Not really."`
	"CN-8632" `	"Sympathy. I understand, it's not the easiest work around, nor the most exciting for someone with their own starship, which is why it can be so hard to find enough couriers to keep the system running."`
	"CN-8633" `	"Enthusiasm. I'm glad to hear that, there aren't nearly enough couriers plying the starways. I'll have your name passed along, and you should see offers to begin hauling media on the job board within a few days."`
	"CN-8634" `You find yourself wandering into what looks like the Avgi version of a spaceport bar. A circular ampitheatre provides seating and tables around the dance floor, with drinks served at a long raised bar that curves around the rim of the room. Curious, you get in line, attracting more than a few interested stares from the aliens, until you reach the bar.`
	"CN-8635" `	"Hey you, want a drink, question?" the bartender asks with a wave, your translator receiving the musical tone. You look behind him, expecting shelves of bottles or barrels, but instead the space behind the bar looks more like a greenhouse, with rows of colorful flowers and plants growing in troughs under blue-violet lights.`
	"CN-8636" `	"Is this stuff safe for humans?" you ask.`
	"CN-8637" `	The bartender splays his arms in what might be a shrug. "Nonchalance. Who knows? Anyway, you want a drink or not?"`
	"CN-8638" `"I'll pass."`
	"CN-8639" `"Sure. What would you recommend?"`
	"CN-8640" `	He gives you a look. "Amusement. You're no regular so I'll start you off with a Quis Nectar. On the house." He turns around, deftly snatching up something close to a cocktail glass, and pulls out a big, dangerous-looking glass pipette from somewhere under the bar. Smoothly dipping it into something that looks like a large pitcher plant, he draws out a clear, slightly pink-tinged liquid before depositing it in the glass. "Enjoy, amusement."`
	"CN-8641" `	(Gulp it down.) "Bottoms up."`
	"CN-8642" `	(Take a sip.) "Thanks."`
	"CN-8643" `	The liquid is pleasantly light and sweet, with a bit of bitterness behind it. It doesn't taste anything like alcohol, but you can feel the lights in the room become a little sharper and brighter.`
	"CN-8644" `	You toss back your glass in a swift movement, swallowing the alien liquid in one smooth gulp. It's pleasantly light, and quite sweet. You can't taste any alcohol, but the room seems to light up as every detail becomes crisp and defined.`
	"CN-8645" `	Another bar patron sidles up next to you. "Hey, you must be one of those aliens, right, question?" The Avgi is a warm, wine-red color, matching the color of her drink.`
	"CN-8646" `	"Yep, that's me. How'd you know?"`
	"CN-8647" `	"No, you must have had a bit too much to drink."`
	"CN-8648" `	"Unamused. Very funny, but I'm not quite that wired."`
	"CN-8649" `	"Amusement. That was rhetorical." She takes a sip from her own drink.`
	"CN-8650" `	"The name's Claret." She extends an arm, which you reach out to shake, but she instead taps her forearm to yours. "You're a hot topic among the Guard, you know?" She peers at you with inscrutable compound eyes.`
	"CN-8651" `	"The Guard?"`
	"CN-8652" `	Claret flares her wings out and raises her arms in an exaggerated pose. "Inflated boast. The Twilight Guard. You know, us brave warriors that are the last line of defense between the murderous Aberrant and the last bastion of Avgi civilization. Well, except for the people stuck back on Aviskir, but we don't talk about that, heh." She waves an arm. "But back to you, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-8653" `	She points at you dramatically. "You're an alien, and you fought the Aberrant. Even though we've seen a few of you people around, none of them have flown a starship quite like yours. Of course we've been talking about you. Wouldn't surprise me if half the Consonance was, really."`
	"CN-8654" `	"Well, what do they say about me?`
	"CN-8655" `	"All good things, I hope."`
	"CN-8656" `	"Dismissive. Of course, everyone is singing your praises. Except for the ones who claim you aren't one of those 'humans' at all, and are secretly an Aberrant in the shape of one waiting for the perfect moment to strike and eat our children." Claret gives you a serious look. "You aren't, right?"`
	"CN-8657" `	"Not last I checked."`
	"CN-8658" `	"Nope."`
	"CN-8659" `	"Well, you've caught me."`
	"CN-8660" `	"Oh no." she says in a completely flat voice. "I am absolutely terrified." She takes a deep drink before sighing contentedly.`
	"CN-8661" `	"Some say that the humans will soon arrive to save us with their superior technology. Others say you'll be the next aliens to invade us, and finish the job the Aberrant started."`
	"CN-8662" `	"And which do you believe?"`
	"CN-8663" `	"Very contradictory rumors."`
	"CN-8664" `	She gives you an incredulous look. "Scorn. When are they not? I don't know about you humans, but ask three Avgi the same question and you'll get six different answers. We are a fractious lot, us Avgi, and that will be true until the stars burn out and the moons fall from the sky.`
	"CN-8665" `	"Amusement. Neither. Either one would be too easy, and that of course can't be allowed, not in this universe. I expect your Republic would spend years and years debating whether to even acknowledge our existence, let alone take any kind of action."`
	"CN-8666" `	"You don't give the Republic enough credit. Parliament can be decisive when it needs to be."`
	"CN-8667" `	"Parliament might be slow, but the Navy is full of good people who would help if they could."`
	"CN-8668" `	"That's a surprisingly accurate estimation of the Republic."`
	"CN-8669" `	"Maybe, but there are others that would try to exploit you. That's just human nature."`
	"CN-8670" `	"Well, the Republic isn't the only government in human space these days. The Free Worlds might try to help you."`
	"CN-8671" `	"Perhaps. I wouldn't hold out hope, though. Like I said, it would be too easy, either if you were out to get us or in to save us. And I don't know how you would fare against the Aberrant either - they might even invade you too, if they could. Your technology may be better than ours, but I've heard quiet rumors it's not that much better, certainly not as good as what the Aberrant use.`
	"CN-8672" `	"Perhaps. But I don't think so, not from what I've seen of you. Your stranded fellows, they dedicated themselves to helping us as soon as they realized they couldn't go home. I didn't like that short fellow though, all he did was complain." She smirks. "Reminded me of an ensign back in school.`
	"CN-8673" `	"You humans aren't too different from us then." She looks thoughtful. "Maybe that would help us get along, your Republic and our Consonance bonding over shared bureaucratic torment. Might even be able to work together and invent something even worse." Claret shudders.`
	"CN-8674" `	"But aside from that, you humans are a true delight. I met your Captain Darius and he regaled me with many stories of your own Navy. Your Carriers sound especially fearsome."`
	"CN-8675" `	"Yes, they are."`
	"CN-8676" `	"Eh, they're not so strong. I've faced a few."`
	"CN-8677" `	"Modest, aren't we, amusement." she says. "Captain Darius told me much about the weapons technology you use, which I was quite fascinated by. But even more interesting is your Navy's doctrine, in my opinion."`
	"CN-8678" `	"What's so interesting about that?"`
	"CN-8679" `	"What do you think of human weapons?"`
	"CN-8680" `	"Amusement. Everyone always cares more about how big the guns are, rather than how they're used. Your particle cannons, for example, seem much like the light ion accelerators that are common on orbital fortifications, only in the form of linear accelerators instead of the synchrotrons we use. And your beam weapons are particularly puzzling, with their abrupt range limit, yet constant beam intensity along that range. And well, as for those 'blaster cannons,' I have no idea how those are even supposed to work. Firing a projectile with the same properties as a shield, perhaps."`
	"CN-8681" `	"What do you mean, 'how they're used?' Isn't that obvious?"`
	"CN-8682" `	Claret looks incredulous, standing up animately. "Disbelief. Doctrine is everything. Both in how we design our weapons and how we actually employ them. Everything is built for a specific purpose, from the largest nuclear missile to the humblest coilgun. You must know your objective, your reason for being, and then you must look at the enemy and see the tools they have to stop you, and then develop your own to counter them. Everything your fleet carries must have a specific purpose, a way to fit into the engagement you have planned, or it is simply dead weight."`
	"CN-8683" `	"What if you don't know what the enemy has?"`
	"CN-8684" `	"Impatience. That's why you gather information, assess their capabilities, and train against a wide variety of threats, even ones well beyond what you think an enemy might really have. All of that informs the way you choose to fight."`
	"CN-8685" `	"How did the Avgi fight, then?"`
	"CN-8686" `	"So what went wrong against the Aberrant, then? Were they just too powerful?"`
	"CN-8687" `	She looks a little happier at your question. "Explanation. Quickly and decisively. High intensity battles, to knock out the enemy as quickly as possible while expending as few resources as possible. You spend days, maybe even weeks, just watching to try and pin down your enemy, and then you launch everything you have. Missiles loosed from extreme range, and then long ranged beams to defend yourself as you close with the enemy fleet. Each ship would have a dedicated role, designed to support each other and the overall fleet with specific capabilities while countering those same capabilities held by the enemy."`
	"CN-8688" `	Claret seems to deflate. "Embarrassment. Yes. Well. That wasn't the core of the problem we had against the Aberrant, I think. The admirals will tell you it was because we weren't united enough, that there was too much disagreement between the fleets sent to stop them, or that the Aberrant simply had stronger ships, but the truth is that our fleets were designed to fight other Avgi, not an unknown race of aliens that simply didn't fit into our doctrine. We built them to fight ourselves so well they weren't equipped to fight someone who didn't play by our rules."`
	"CN-8689" `	"What happened in those first battles?"`
	"CN-8690" `	"So how has your doctrine changed since then?"`
	"CN-8691" `	"We used to have years to look into the capabilities of our likely opponents, and try and figure out what they could do and how well they could do it. We had missiles designed to track enemy torches, and ships filled with enough of them to kill half a dozen peers before needing resupply. And that worked, because it wasn't like a giant fleet of nigh-invincible enemies was going to appear out of nowhere, right?"`
	"CN-8692" `	She clicks her fingers. "Despair. All of that failed against the Aberrant. We weren't well equipped to track them at range, with how dim their engines are compared to us, and letting them get close was a death sentence for ships that mostly carried long range nuclear missiles. The first encounters with them were one-sided slaughters, until engineers slapped bigger radar arrays on our ships to try and spot the Aberrant before they could tear through us."`
	"CN-8693" `	"Did that work?"`
	"CN-8694" `	"That stopped the bloodletting, for a while. Apprehension. Until the front lines began to run low on missiles. When it takes a ship's entire magazine to kill an Aberrant before it has to retreat and resupply, it simply isn't sustainable. And the particle beams wielded by some of our ships, the ones that could fight at long range, were simply absorbed by the Aberrant's shields, something we're still trying to overcome. But for a while it seemed like nothing was working."`
	"CN-8695" `	"Praise. We had to completely throw out everything we thought we knew and start over. We ended up bringing back coilguns and kinetic kill vehicles - ridiculously short range weapons compared to a serious beam or missile. But it's what we could field at short notice, and build in the numbers needed to at least hold the Aberrant at bay. What we fly these days would probably be slaughtered by a pre-Incursion fleet, but the Aberrant fight at a much shorter range anyway, and our modern fleets have much better endurance when it comes to ammunition."`
	"CN-8696" `	Claret thrums with laughter. "If you had told a planner that we'd be fighting with coilguns and kinetic kill vehicles, before the Incursion you'd have been laughed out of the room. But we're lucky that the Aberrant's weapons are short ranged, such that we can actually hit them at the range of a dumb projectile from a coilgun without being instantly swatted out of the sky."`
	"CN-8697" `	"Don't the Aberrant still have superior technology?"`
	"CN-8698" `	"And now you're able to hold your own against them?"`
	"CN-8699" `	"Discomfort. Maybe at first, when we could count on having a numerical advantage, but the Aberrant continue to reproduce at a faster rate than we can build ships. And these new weapons, well, they were considered obsolete for a reason. We need something that can dish out more damage, and at a longer range, without being as expensive and resource-intensive as a missile."`
	"CN-8700" `	"Oh, yes, appreciation. But they don't use it to its full extent, probably because they aren't intelligent beings in their own right. They just make more of each other, without any changes other than occasional mistakes. And their weapons don't seem like they were meant to be weapons, if that makes sense. More of a cutting beam than a true weaponized laser."`
	"CN-8701" `	"That's why things really were desperate, until you humans came around. That changed everything, knowing there was a non-hostile, if not outright friendly, alien power nearby. Even though it sounds like your government isn't able to help directly, given the lack of connecting starways, technological support from a more advanced species could be enough for us to win. Shields, shared by your people, were already a game changer by themselves."`
	"CN-8702" `	"I'm not sure humanity would be able to help all that much, with our technology."`
	"CN-8703" `	"Wait, you got shields from us?"`
	"CN-8704" `	"From the humans that were stranded here, yes, gratitude. They let us dismantle their ship's shield generator and explained the rough concept to us, and we've been able to produce our own imitation, though I hear it isn't nearly as good."`
	"CN-8705" `	"Dismissal. I've seen the <ship>, and the ship your friends arrived on. That's the kind of firepower we need to take on the Aberrant and win."`
	"CN-8706" `	"If you say so."`
	"CN-8707" `	"I hope you're right."`
	"CN-8708" `	With that, you turn to lighter topics, as Claret finishes her drink. You learn about the new traditions the Twilight Guard is trying to promote to ensure unity and cohesion within its ranks, trying to bind together former members of dozens of independent militaries into a united whole. This apparently involves a lot of travel to promote inter-unit bonding, as well as frequent cycling between the front lines and the Outer Limits.`
	"CN-8709" `	Eventually, Claret is ready to leave. "Anyway, I'll see you around. And, a word of advice. If you're ever on a Twilight Guard station, look out for officers or Guardsmen who are looking for a ride. We often have people trying to make an impromptu trip, and our logistics have been so overstretched lately they're willing to contract with outside captains, if they're trustworthy."`
	"CN-8710" `	"I'll keep that in mind," you say.`
	"CN-8711" `Ergastirio Station is quiet as you disembark from the <ship>. Everyone you see seems purposeful and deliberate, moving as if they all know exactly where they need to be. Wandering about as you are, you can't help but feel that you stand out, a feeling that proves warranted when a female Avgi stops you, a vibrant red tinged with purple.`
	"CN-8712" `	"Curiosity, hello. Who are you?"`
	"CN-8713" `	"Sorry, I was just looking around."`
	"CN-8714" `	"Sorry, am I not supposed to be here?"`
	"CN-8715" `	"Oh. Amusement," she thrums in laughter for a moment, "it isn't that, I've just never met an alien before."`
	"CN-8716" `"Oh. That makes sense," you say, feeling a bit stupid.`
	"CN-8717" `	"I'm Alizarin, but you can call me Aliza. I'm a senior research fellow here at Ergastirio," she says with a touch of pride.`
	"CN-8718" `	"What kind of stuff do you do here?"`
	"CN-8719" `	"What do you research?"`
	"CN-8720" `	"Well, I'm a shockwave dynamics specialist, though I dabble in accelerator testing occasionally. My work with both of those is in nuclear weapons design, mostly in implosion and ablation modeling. We do all sorts of stuff here though, but it's all weapons related. Not much of a choice with the War, you know."`
	"CN-8721" `	"Nuclear weapons? Fascinating."`
	"CN-8722" `	"Nuclear weapons? That's... interesting, I guess."`
	"CN-8723" `	"Nuclear weapons? I'm not a fan honestly."`
	"CN-8724" `	"Ah, well. Not everyone can appreciate art. But you'll see the light, heh heh, when the Aberrant come knocking. Nothing else hits 'em the same way, appreciation."`
	"CN-8725" `	"Enthusiasm. They are! I wish there was time to explain the fine art of weapons design, but alas, I have an appointment in less than an hour... Consideration. Actually, I've just had an idea," she says, looking thoughtful.`
	"CN-8726" `	"Hey, you've been vetted by the Assembly itself, right? You wanna see an atomics test? We've got one scheduled for today, and I heard you aliens are scared of nukes, so you've probably never seen one before."`
	"CN-8727" `	"Sure, why not?"`
	"CN-8728" `	"Actually, I have. It wasn't pretty."`
	"CN-8729" `	"Surprise. I thought you had some kind of taboo around them, no?"`
	"CN-8730" `	"Some people decided to break that taboo."`
	"CN-8731" `	"Things in human space have changed since then."`
	"CN-8732" `	"Ah, that's good to hear. From what I've heard you humans are rather silly about atomics, as though the average hyperdrive wasn't handling energies of the same order. Anyway, do you want to see an atomics test?"`
	"CN-8733" `	"I'll pass. Nothing I haven't seen before."`
	"CN-8734" `	"Disappointment. You're missing out, but oh well. Anyway, I gotta go, catch ya later!" Aliza scampers off towards a few Avgi waving at her by a door.`
	"CN-8735" `	"Joy. Excellent! We do our testing on the dwarf planet below, at the Dokimi Range. A good place for testing the more exciting projects, far from anything valuable of course."`
	"CN-8736" `	You're interrupted by another Avgi, who lands right in front of you. With his wings still fanned out from his faded blue body, he ignores you to point at Aliza accusingly.`
	"CN-8737" `	"Impatience. Ah, Alizarin, just who I was looking for." He waves his arms frantically as he dances around. "I was hoping you would have sent the new beam-target interaction results along my way by now, but your office claimed you were busy with a more important project, which I simply cannot believe is the case."`
	"CN-8738" `	Aliza folds her arms. "Annoyance. I don't know what to tell you, Trypan, we're working our way through the backlog as fast as we can. I can't get you your accelerator time any faster, you know that's just not how it works."`
	"CN-8739" `	"Disgust. You do know what's at stake, do you not? We need that data, it is utterly critical to our work! This new armor will be impenetrable, a shield that could win the War!" Trypan tries to look stern and disappointed, an effect that is not helped by the fact that he keeps prancing around you.`
	"CN-8740" `	"Who was that?"`
	"CN-8741" `	"What did he mean by 'impenetrable armor?'"`
	"CN-8742" `	"Annoyance. That was Trypan. My point of contact with a group of wealthy individuals with far too much influence and not enough sense. For years they've been convinced we just need 'one more prototype, just one more experiment' to produce a breakthrough to win the War. She sighs. "No one really takes them seriously anymore, not after all the failed projects they've sponsored, but they do shell out the equipment we need for free, so we have to at least act like we're listening to their 'new ideas.' That they have a few seats in the Consonance between them doesn't hurt either, when we need more resources or funding."`
	"CN-8743" `	"Trypan and his technocrat friends are convinced they're on the verge of a breakthrough to 'win the War,' as they love to claim. For a while they were obsessed with absurd superweapons - had us actually try again to develop a hyperspace weapon, despite everyone trying that for decades. There's basically no theory behind the idea anyway, trust me," she assures you. "Now they're convinced we can cook up a supermaterial of some kind that will be invulnerable to the Aberrant beams, when we still don't even really know how they work."`
	"CN-8744" `	She shakes her head animatedly, looking rather put off. "He and the group backing him have been having us run their 'prototype' samples through our linear accelerator - this big 'ol electron beam in the Third Wing of the station. We use it for all sorts of research, and we do conduct material testing with it, but it's gotten ridiculous lately. They keep acting surprised when we burn through their plates of whatever alloy they've cooked up in a fraction of a second." She gives you an amused look. "At least that makes each beam run short, but cleaning out the accelerator is more annoying than you'd think."`
	"CN-8745" `	She looks past you, towards a door. "Ah, my colleagues. We were going to catch an Akoustiki down to the surface, but you have a ship, right? Want to be our ride?"`
	"CN-8746" `	"I don't have time, sorry."`
	"CN-8747" `The descent to Dokimi is uneventful, but you get a good look at the planetoid's icy surface, stained red with organic tholins. The ice is smooth and pristine under most of your flight path, but eventually something new comes into view: austere buildings, crude roads, and overshadowing all else, the flat expanse of a field pockmarked with craters.`
	"CN-8748" `	"A little dreary, isn't it, amusement?" comments Aliza.`
	"CN-8749" `	"Yeah. Why do testing out here instead of in empty space?"`
	"CN-8750" `	"Do you just test nukes here?"`
	"CN-8751" `	"It's nice to have a big mass to brace experiments against and bury sensors in, explanation. Plus we get to see the effects of weapons on bulk mass, like all this ice and the occasional rock outcropping. It makes quite the blast plume," she adds happily.`
	"CN-8752" `	"We used to use some big asteroids for this, but we kept blowing through them, amusement. Relocating our lab after every big test was getting annoying, so we picked this planetoid out and stuck an outpost on it."`
	"CN-8753" `	"Why this planet in particular?"`
	"CN-8754" `	"Blowing through asteroids? Just how big are these nukes?"`
	"CN-8755" `	"Consideration." She looks thoughtful. "Well, the lab managers told us to go somewhere far enough from the Navigeo Yards to be out of the way of anything important, so that they don't have to worry about getting flashed with radiation every week. But really I think it's because they wanted their own little planetoid as a personal fief where no one could tell them what to do, and Dokimi is so utterly unremarkable that no one else wanted it for anything else."`
	"CN-8756" `	"Heh, we can make them as big as we want to. 'Just add more lithium deuteride,' as they say, amusement. Once you get a proper two-stage device, you can pretty much just add more stages to boost the yield. Two or three hundred megatons is easy, if a bit impractical to fit in the sizes of missile we field. But we sometimes test at that range, to validate other ideas and designs."`
	"CN-8757" `	"Nah, we run all sorts of fun stuff that we can't test on Ergastirio, appreciation. The really big particle beams, for example, and reactor pumped lasers that would be annoying to shield on the station."`
	"CN-8758" `	She gestures out the window, towards some stony mountains. "You can find a valley out that way with all sorts of tracks carved in the ice. I wrote my name in a patch of stone, actually."`
	"CN-8759" `	At Aliza's direction, you set the <ship> down on an icy pad by one of the small buildings. A few Avgi come out to greet you, wearing silver-colored spacesuits with comically large bubble helmets.`
	"CN-8760" `	"How long until the test?"`
	"CN-8761" `	Aliza checks a clock. "We've got most of the day. Want to help us set up, question?"`
	"CN-8762" `	"Sure, I've got nothing better to do," you say.`
	"CN-8763" `	What follows is a surprisingly mundane day of helping the crew set up various sensors and instruments at carefully marked distances from ground zero. As you're helping drill a borehole through the ice, through which yet another probe will be dropped, you see a sled in the distance drive by, an innocent-looking teardrop object strapped to its bed. It can't be any bigger than you yourself are, yet this must be the device that will be tested in only a few hours, raised on top of a slim steel tower that has already been erected.`
	"CN-8764" `	"So that's an Avgi atomic."`
	"CN-8765" `	(Continue working.)`
	"CN-8766" `	"Yep. This is a mid-sized device, only sixty megatons. Weighs a bit under three tons, so it's a bit large for the tiny little missiles we've been stuck with since the Incursion drove us out here, but I've heard there's a team working on spooling up a production line for a more capable missile bus so that we can get these deployed."`
	"CN-8767" `	She looks suddenly embarrassed. "Worry. But you didn't hear that from me, of course. Information security is a lot more relaxed now that we're all mostly on the same side, but still... can't hurt to be safe."`
	"CN-8768" `	A few hours later, and a quick skim over Dokimi's surface in an Akoustiki Excursion Vehicle, you find yourself in a bunker dug into the ice a few dozen kilometers away. Up in the mountains, you have direct line of sight to the range, which sits just on the horizon.`
	"CN-8769" `	You stand in silence, hunched over in a bunker not designed to accommodate one of your stature. A few Avgi shuffle awkwardly and try to make small talk, but it invariably trails away into the silence. Someone near the back coughs, an odd whistling sound, as you all stare at the room's sole window, tinted dark enough so as to be black. Finally, over the hum of electric lights, a nameless technician begins counting down together with the clock. "Twelve, eleven, ten, nine..."`
	"CN-8770" `	You find yourself holding your breath as the countdown inches to zero. "Three, two, one...`
	"CN-8771" `	"...Zero."`
	"CN-8772" `	For a moment, silence. And then, light. Light. Nothing but light, a light that consumes your whole world even as the tinted glass shields your eyes from all but the barest glimpse of its edges. For a handful of seconds, a time that stretches into a lifetime, your whole world is light. Then it dims by a bare margin, merely blinding instead of consuming, and you can tell there is something outside the window other than infinite light, the border where the bunker ends and the landscape begins. And the landscape is illuminated, lit by a sun crafted by mortal hands. A sphere of brilliance rests in the distance, utterly still as it only just touches the planetoid's surface. As it dims with each passing moment, within the new sun you swear you can see something opaque and hard-edged, almost as if it were solid, a shape that burns with primordial fire.`
	"CN-8773" `	And then the light intensifies again as the brief moment of clarity is unmade, the ball of atomic fire expanding and burning brighter as the plasma cools and becomes transparent once more. Your glimpse into its heart is broken as the planet's ice, flashed into incandescent vapor, shrouds it in a column of mundane fire.`
	"CN-8774" `	In the space of a breath the chained heart of a star fades to a mere city-sized ball of flame.`
	"CN-8775" `	"Incredible."`
	"CN-8776" `	"Terrifying."`
	"CN-8777" `	"Contemplation. Indeed it is." You turn and see Aliza watching the fireball with you, along with a few others. The rest are dutifully staring at instrument readouts and sensor logs, collecting whatever esoteric knowledge they sought to gain from this test.`
	"CN-8778" `	"So, how did it go?"`
	"CN-8779" `	"What were you trying to learn from this?"`
	"CN-8780" `	"Enthusiasm. The point of this wasn't in the actual bomb - it's an old, reliable design with plenty of heritage, so we know how it works. Rather, we used it essentially as a giant x-ray source to drive a dozen other experiments. That's pretty common in nuclear testing, actually, since experiments that could benefit from a nuke are far more common than new designs that need to be tested. Most of the experiments we ran today were nuclear-driven accelerator tests, using the energy of the explosion to drive a particle beam. Just the laboratory scale for now, but we hope to scale it up into a proper weapon at some point," she says, looking proud.`
	"CN-8781" `	"That's impressive."`
	"CN-8782" `	"I didn't know you could use nuclear weapons that way."`
	"CN-8783" `	"Oh, that's just scratching the surface. Just using them as a simple bomb is a bit of a waste really, you can use them to drive all sorts of lasers and particle beams, and even kinetics if you know what you're doing. You can push their effective range way up there with the right methods."`
	"CN-8784" `	"Making nuclear weapons more dangerous is almost scary to think about."`
	"CN-8785" `	"That all sounds very interesting. And useful against the Aberrant, too."`
	"CN-8786" `	"Yes, yes it is," she says. "Now, would you mind giving me a ride back up to Ergastirio, question?"`
	"CN-8787" `	You drop off Aliza near the same place you met her, in the main concourse. It's rather more full than last time, with a veritable crowd moving through the room, probably fresh off a transport ship. Aliza seems to spot someone she recognizes. Waving, she drags you over to a dark blue Avgi in dark, steel gray clothing.`
	"CN-8788" `	"This is my colleague, Yinmn," she says. "And this is Captain <first> <last>."`
	"CN-8789" `	"Greetings. Hey there. I work in the accounting section for Ergastirio. And you're of course Captain <last>, the alien everyone's been talking about."`
	"CN-8790" `	"Huh, what do you do there?"`
	"CN-8791" `	"Accounting? That's an odd job for a lab."`
	"CN-8792" `	Yinmn hums with laughter. "Amusement, not that kind of accounting. I account for nuclear materials, not credits. We have to make sure every last drop of fissiles that could be used to make a bomb is kept secure. Not only for security reasons, but because it's extremely valuable out here in the Outer Limits. Not many of the heavier elements out here, sadly, and we've been having issues with shortages lately. It only takes a few kilos to make a bomb, but we do go through a lot of them..."`
	"CN-8793" `	"Explanation. I account for nuclear materials, not credits. We have to make sure every last drop of fissiles that could be used to make a bomb is kept secure. Not only for security reasons, but because it's extremely valuable out here in the Outer Limits. Not many of the heavier elements out here, sadly, and we've been having issues with shortages lately. It only takes a few kilos to make a bomb, but we do go through a lot of them..."`
	"CN-8794" `	Aliza chimes in. "And a lot of people, especially certain elements in the Dissonance, would like to get their hands on some of our stockpile of fissile materials. We do quite a bit of mining, and have an impressive amount of breeder reactors running on fusion neutrons, so the amount of material being circulated at any given moment is quite high. Yinmn could tell you a lot of stories about the piracy that goes on with that supply chain."`
	"CN-8795" `	Yinmn taps his arms together. "Heh, but we'd be here for days, amusement. I'll just leave it at this: our convoys are often trailed by 'merchants' apparently making supply runs to secure facilities. Those are the worst, not the members of the Dissonance themselves, but the ones who hide their sympathies and feign loyalty to the Consonance."`
	"CN-8796" `	"Wait, so do they have nukes too?"`
	"CN-8797" `	"Have you ever lost any nuclear material to them?"`
	"CN-8798" `	"Pride. Not under my watch. But, well, I'm not exactly the only Accountant in the Consonance. So yes, material has gone missing before. Rarely through overt piracy, but usually because someone 'forgot' to record the true amount in a shipment, or because it was allocated to a captain that didn't really exist."`
	"CN-8799" `	"Oh, of course they do. Even if they weren't stealing from us, which is risky but has an enormous potential payout, they have all the tools you'd need to breed or enrich fissile materials on their own, so no doubt do they have a stockpile of weapons themselves."`
	"CN-8800" `	"Sounds like you could use some help with security."`
	"CN-8801" `	"Is there a way I could help escort those shipments?"`
	"CN-8802" `	Yinmn thinks for a moment. "Consideration. Well, we usually have the Twilight Guard escort them, but with how thin they've been stretched lately, with those latest Aberrant incursions into the Tangled Shroud, any kind of relief would go a long way. I could look into whether you could be eligible to help with escort duties - as one of only a few aliens we've ever met, you could ironically be more trustworthy than just another random Avgi captain. Be on the lookout for opportunities on the job board, if I can make this work out."`
	"CN-8803" `	"I will."`
	"CN-8804" `	"Appreciation. Well, it was a pleasure to meet you, <first>, but I've got to go start analyzing the data from the test," Aliza says. "If you're ever around Ergastirio or Dokimi, feel free to stop by and chat. I'm sure we'll see more of each other in the future."`
	"CN-8805" `When you depart your ship, you're startled by a small alien ship uncloaking right in front of you. Two elegant mantis-like creatures step off it, each holding a strange looking weapon pointed directly at you. They have four long insectoid legs and two arms. Although their arms end in what look like hands, they also have strange claw-like features that partially enclose them, extending outward from their forearms to grasp their weapons. You look around to see if there's anyone else witnessing this, but you've landed at <origin>'s main spaceport in the middle of the night, leaving you as the only human in sight.`
	"CN-8806" `	The aliens begin speaking to you in a language you don't understand, their words interspersed with clicking noises. As one of them speaks, they sound almost robotic, as if they are speaking through a synthesizer. Taking a closer look, you spot what you can only guess are cybernetic modifications to parts of the alien's body; the alien's throat and one of its eyes look non-organic, as well as the joints of its legs. The other one has no such visible modifications, though.`
	"CN-8807" `	"Do you come in peace?"`
	"CN-8808" `	"I don't understand a word you're saying."`
	"CN-8809" `	"Don't shoot! I'll take you to my leader."`
	"CN-8810" `	The aliens look at each other and say a few words. One of them grabs a small device from a belt and throws it on the ground in front of you.`
	"CN-8811" `	(Pick it up.)`
	"CN-8812" `	(Dodge for cover.)`
	"CN-8813" `	You pick up the device and look at it. It springs open in your hand, causing you to drop it. After it falls to the ground, it begins projecting a holographic star map. You recognize some of the systems on the map as those where you fought an alien fleet, made up of ships similar to the one in front of you. A single system within that region is highlighted. The aliens return to their ship, which becomes invisible again, and although you can't see it, you hear it take off and fly away.`
	"CN-8814" `	You dodge for cover behind your ship. After a few seconds, you hear a springing sound. When you look back out from behind your ship, the aliens are gone, and the device they threw at you is now projecting a holographic star map. You recognize some of the systems on the map as those where you fought an alien fleet, made up of ships similar to the one in front of you. A single system within that region is highlighted. The alien ship becomes invisible once again, and although you can't see it, you hear it take off and fly away.`
	"CN-8815" `As you enter the atmosphere, you're flanked by two large alien ships which guide you to the surface, leading you to a particular landing zone. When you leave your ship, you're met by two aliens that look similar to the ones that startled you on <origin>, including having the same weaponry.`
	"CN-8816" `	As you take a moment to look around, you find yourself in the middle of a massive metropolis. Skyscrapers taller than anything you've ever seen in human space cover the horizon, although most of the buildings around you appear far more elegant in architecture. Directly ahead is a large palace-like building with a considerable number of steps leading up to the front doors.`
	"CN-8817" `	You take a step forward, but one of the aliens says something while waving its weapon around, and you take the hint that you shouldn't be moving right now. The other says something into a communication device, then sits down on the ground and gestures for you to do the same. You suspect that you might be waiting here for a while.`
	"CN-8818" `	(Sit down.)`
	"CN-8819" `	(Turn around and re-enter my ship.)`
	"CN-8820" `	You re-enter your ship, and the aliens don't move to stop you. You decide to turn your ship back on and attempt to take off, but just as you try to activate the repulsor engines, you hear a loud buzzing sound coming from outside. You look out the nearest window, and see that the aliens have moved some sort of vehicle near your ship, buzzing with energy. You attempt to take off, but your ship's repulsor engines aren't moving you anywhere. The vehicle seems like it is deactivating any nearby repulsors.`
	"CN-8821" `	(Blast the vehicle with a turret.)`
	"CN-8822" `	(Leave my ship and sit down with the aliens.)`
	"CN-8823" `	You turn one of your turrets toward the vehicle and fire, then immediately try to pull up. It looks like your shot either destroyed the vehicle or disrupted it enough for you to escape its influence as your ship rapidly rises into the atmosphere. It looks like the aliens didn't take too kindly to your action, though, as you begin seeing ships targeting you on your radar.`
	"CN-8824" `	You exit your ship and sit down on the boarding ramp. The aliens that are watching you don't seem to care that you just tried to leave.`
	"CN-8825" `	You sit down on the boarding ramp of your ship and gaze at the scenery while you wait.`
	"CN-8826" `	After some time, you look up to the palace steps and notice a six-limbed creature unlike the mantis-like aliens watching over you. As it slowly makes its way downward and gets to the last few steps, the aliens guarding you stand to attention. You wonder if this entire time you've just been waiting for this alien to reach the bottom of the stairs.`
	"CN-8827" `	The creature approaches you on all six limbs, but stands up on its hind two legs once it is only a few paces away from you. It is rather small, hardly reaching your chin while it stands at full height, with big round eyes and a large, bulbous nose. It extends its four arms outward, revealing the palms of its hands. Except for its face and palms, it is covered in a thin layer of golden brown fur. It begins speaking. You can't understand what it's saying, but it seems to be cycling through various different languages and pausing after each line, as each sentence sounds wildly different from the last. You're suddenly startled when it says perfectly, "Hello."`
	"CN-8828" `	"Hello?"`
	"CN-8829" `	"Wait, say that again."`
	"CN-8830" `	"Hello," the creature repeats itself. "Hello. Hello. Hello," it continues to say.`
	"CN-8831" `	"Can you say anything else?"`
	"CN-8832" `	"Can you say anything else?" it repeats back to you.`
	"CN-8833" `	"How do you know my language?" it repeats back to you.`
	"CN-8834" `	"Human?" it asks.`
	"CN-8835" `	"Yes, I am a human."`
	"CN-8836" `	"What even are you?"`
	"CN-8837" `	"Human," it says to itself confidently. "Human. Human. Human," it repeats, looking around as if it is searching for something in its mind. "One... hundred years ago. Human," it says.`
	"CN-8838" `	"I'm not the first human here?"`
	"CN-8839" `	"What do you mean one hundred years ago?"`
	"CN-8840" `	"Human visitors, many years ago," it says. "Not important. The Queen desires your presence." It then says something in a language that the mantis-like aliens understand, and they motion for you to follow as the small alien begins making its way back to the steps of the palace. You have a feeling you're going to dread the next half hour.`
	"CN-8841" `	You finally reach the top of the palace stairs completely exhausted, although the aliens with you look entirely unphased.`
	"CN-8842" `	The aliens lead you into the palace and through various elegant hallways. The walls are lined with marble statues and paintings that seem to be depicting historical figures and events for this alien race, although you're not allowed to linger long enough to get a good look at any of them.`
	"CN-8843" `	You eventually approach a large ornate doorway that the aliens push open, revealing what must be the Queen's throne room. It is a long, narrow room lined with stained glass windows with what you guess is a throne chair where the alien Queen sits. The Queen is part of the mantis-like species and considerably larger in appearance than the ones guarding you.`
	"CN-8844" `	The small creature says something to the Queen as you approach, and the Queen responds. The creature turns to you to translate.`
	"CN-8845" `	"I hear that you have attacked one of my Megasa."`
	"CN-8846" `	"Your what?"`
	"CN-8847" `	"I was only defending myself."`
	"CN-8848" `	"I have, and for that I apologize."`
	"CN-8849" `	"Okay, and?"`
	"CN-8850" `	"I hear that you have attacked one of my civilians."`
	"CN-8851" `	"I hear that you have fought a member of my guard."`
	"CN-8852" `	"Hey, they deserved it. They attacked me first."`
	"CN-8853" `	"I hear that you have attacked one of my Erabu."`
	"CN-8854" `	As the small creature translates for you, the Queen seems to laugh in a strange chittering way. "The Erabu are the aristocrats of my land. Attacking them is a grave offense," the creature translates for the Queen. "What do you say for yourself?"`
	"CN-8855" `	As the small creature translates for you, the Queen seems to laugh in a strange chittering way. "The Megasa are the lowest of my people, but still my people to defend," the creature translates for the Queen. "What do you say for yourself?"`
	"CN-8856" `	"Whoever I attacked, I was only defending myself."`
	"CN-8857" `	"Well, then for that I apologize."`
	"CN-8858" `	As the small creature translates for you, the Queen seems to laugh in a strange chittering way. "Yes, my royal guards are rather... eager to defend, and for that I apologize," the creature translates as the Queen speaks. "But would my royal guard truly be doing its duty if it were not defending my lands from unknown threats? Although, perhaps they could be more patient in assessing true threats. I might punish those responsible, but it would seem that you have already dealt with those who have slighted you."`
	"CN-8859" `	As the small creature translates for you, the Queen seems to laugh in a strange chittering way. "Deserved, you say?" the creature translates as the Queen speaks. "Would my royal guard truly be doing its duty if it were not defending my lands from unknown threats? Although, perhaps they could be more patient in assessing true threats. I might punish those responsible, but it would seem that you have already dealt with those who have slighted you."`
	"CN-8860" `	As the small creature translates for you, the Queen steps off of her throne and approaches you. She extends her legs so that she towers over you to at least twice your height. She speaks, and the creature translates. "How flippant you are, to lie like that in front of the highest royalty. You're either extremely brave, or extremely stupid." The Queen turns around and returns to her throne. "I will show mercy, just this once. But you will not be so fortunate the next time."`
	"CN-8861" `	As the small creature translates for you, the Queen steps off of her throne and approaches you. She extends her legs so that she towers over you to at least twice your height. She speaks, and the creature translates. "How flippant you are, to speak like that in front of the highest royalty. You're either extremely brave, or extremely stupid." The Queen turns around and returns to her throne. "I will show mercy, just this once. But you will not be so fortunate the next time."`
	"CN-8862" `	As the small creature translates for you, the Queen looks as if she is smiling. "An apology. Such an... unexpected response," the creature continues to translate for the Queen. "Normally, those who have offended the Queen attempt to make excuses for themselves. Your apology is accepted."`
	"CN-8863" `	The Queen motions to one of the guards and says something to them that the creature does not translate. She then speaks to you, and the creature translates: "Since you have apologized, you will be allowed to live. My guards have been ordered to leave you be, and you may come and go on a small number of our worlds. But this is only so that you do not cause further trouble, and to allow you to refuel if you are passing through my systems. Your presence will only be tolerated, not welcomed. Now please leave my court."`
	"CN-8864" `	The Queen motions to one of the guards and says something to them that the creature does not translate. She then speaks to you, and the creature translates: "Since I have shown you mercy, you will be allowed to live. My guards have been ordered to leave you be, and you may come and go on a small number of our worlds. But this is only so that you do not cause further trouble, and to allow you to refuel if you are passing through my systems. Your presence will only be tolerated, not welcomed. Now please leave my court."`
	"CN-8865" `	The Queen motions to one of the guards and says something to them that the creature does not translate. She then speaks to you, and the creature translates: "Since it is my guards that have shown you disrespect, you will be allowed to live. My guards have been ordered to leave you be, and you may come and go on a small number of our worlds. But this is only so that you do not cause further trouble, and to allow you to refuel if you are passing through my systems. Your presence will only be tolerated, not welcomed. Now please leave my court."`
	"CN-8866" `	You're escorted out of the throne room and told by the small creature to leave as soon as you reach your ship. You exit the palace, and realize that you must once again face the stairs. You take a deep breath, and prepare yourself for the long journey down.`
	"CN-8867" `Walking through the spaceport, you're approached by a Saryd in unusually traditional clothing, even by Saryd standards. Silk robes not too different from human kimonos cover most of his body, and thin ropes tightly wrap around the fabric near his hoofs.`
	"CN-8868" `	"Greetings, Captain. Interested in participating in a cultural celebration, would you be?" he asks.`
	"CN-8869" `	"What sort of celebration?"`
	"CN-8870" `	"A celebration of Saryd folklore, it is," he explains. "Though for a long time among the stars we've lived, timeless classics from before our spacefaring age, we still celebrate. A set of theatrical plays about some of them, today we are hosting. Watch them for free, anyone can."`
	"CN-8871" `	"I've always got time for a story. Lead the way."`
	"CN-8872" `	"I'm not really up for a story now. I'll pass."`
	"CN-8873" `	You follow him outside the spaceport city and deep into a nearby forest. On the way there, several other Saryds in similar ancient garbs are guiding others who were also intrigued by the offer.`
	"CN-8874" `	You arrive at a clearing with three different paths to take, and you can make out a faint light from deep within each of them. After a few minutes, it seems as if all the Saryds involved in the celebration have arrived. They grab three caskets from behind a bush and lay them before you and the others they brought here.`
	"CN-8875" `	"Now friends, choose your path, you must," one of the Saryds says, and many from the crowd grab small objects from the caskets, seemingly already familiar with this. You move forward to look into the caskets and see that each one has different things inside: the left one is full of seeds, the middle one full of seashells, and the right one full of feathers.`
	"CN-8876" `	(Grab a seed.)`
	"CN-8877" `	(Grab a seashell.)`
	"CN-8878" `	(Grab a feather.)`
	"CN-8879" `	Once you have the feather in your hands, the organizers tell you to go through the path on the right.`
	"CN-8880" `	The light you had seen turns out to be a bonfire near a wooden stage, about a third of the size of human opera stages, and you find a spot to sit on one of the logs positioned near the fire. Several lights shine onto the stage, and as you look up, you can only barely see some spotlights hidden high up in the trees. After the audience is all gathered, the curtains of the stage open to reveal many small figures made out of what looks like paper in a style that loosely resembles origami. They are supported either by thin wooden poles from below or strings from above. There are figures close to where the curtains were and others further away on the stage, the various layers granting depth to the scenery. After a brief moment, the show begins:`
	"CN-8881" `	Entering a clearing, a Saryd huntress with gray hair stalks a large bird resting on a rock. She moves on the borders of the clearing, hiding behind bushes and small trees. She looks for the best spot from which to snipe at the bird, her bow and arrow ready in her hands. It's only when she is nearing a large entrance to the clearing, on the opposite side of where she entered, that she finds the spot, and takes aim.`
	"CN-8882" `	She is disrupted when she hears a loud roar and jumps to the ground, narrowly avoiding the beast that had come from behind her. You're unsure how accurate the paper's depiction of the creature is, but you can only describe it as a "hedge-lion": slightly larger than lions from Earth, with various quills where its mane should be. The quills continue in a line on its back, reaching the tip of the tail.`
	"CN-8883" `	Having dodged the pounce, the huntress runs past the bird, looking for cover, but the forest isn't dense enough to block the beast's advance. It attacks again, and wounds the top of one of her frontal legs. She kicks it with another leg and readies an arrow, but only manages to scratch its face. The animal gets on its hind legs to swipe down at her but is stunned; the bird has attacked its eyes, blinding it! The huntress is swift to take aim in the opening granted, and an arrow pierces the creature's torso. Once the hedge-lion has fallen, the bird flies away, and the curtains close.`
	"CN-8884" `	Once you have the seed in your hands, the organizers tell you to go through the path on the left.`
	"CN-8885" `	The central figure is a young Saryd boy, galloping through a dense forest. Sound effects of thunder begin and grow increasingly frequent, echoing around you as if in a real thunderstorm. A white piece of paper, shaped like a lightning bolt, comes down swiftly and strikes one of the trees in the boy's way. Flame-shaped folds rain down from the top of the stage and stick to the tree as it falls, blocking the boy's path. He turns to run elsewhere. Another lightning bolt, and another tree falls. After a few more repetitions, the boy is too tired to run anymore. Hurt by some of the flames, he is now limping through the forest.`
	"CN-8886" `	Whimpering as the thunder grows closer once more, he spots a tree unlike the others, a great oak with branches thicker than the other trees around him. He goes to it and lays down at its base, and soon he falls asleep as the curtain closes.`
	"CN-8887" `	It opens once again after a few moments, with the boy waking up in darkness. When he gets up, rumbling sounds are accompanied by rays of light reaching the ground, and he realizes the great oak had lowered its branches around him. As it lifts them up, the several smaller trees that had fallen on the mighty oak's branches during the storm are scattered away. The sun as his guide, the boy manages to leave the forest, and the curtains close again.`
	"CN-8888" `	Once you have the seashell in your hands, the organizers tell you to go through the path in the middle.`
	"CN-8889" `	A Saryd is on top of some sort of long, wooden platform, with a deep blue background under it. Only when you see the fishing rod do you realize that he is on a boat, fishing at sea. He feels a bite, but when he reels it in, there is nothing on the hook. He feels another bite and again finds nothing. Time and again, he looks at the hook to find the bait still there, intact, yet he continues to feel bites, some so powerful even the boat moves a little. The day moves by quickly, with a piece of paper representing the sun moving swiftly from one side of the "sky" to the other.`
	"CN-8890" `	Once it is night, the waves grow increasingly stronger, and the Saryd stops fishing altogether. He puts the rod on the boat and tries to steer it back to shore, but he can't find his way. A huge wave that goes beyond the stage's top approaches, and engulfs the boat.`
	"CN-8891" `	The fisherman kicks and struggles for air, having lost his boat and still at the mercy of the great waves. The view on the stage starts going down, following the kicks, and something starts rising up to meet the Saryd's legs. As it raises the view back with it, a creature reminiscent of a whale, only with much larger, longer flippers that almost link to its tail, comes to the surface. It rises gently and with care, as if trying to serve as ground for the sailor. Another wave is approaching, large enough to engulf them both, but the whale keeps on going up until it is out of the water.`
	"CN-8892" `	As it flies through the night sky, the whale is careful to not drop the Saryd, always waiting for him to find stable footing before turning. For the rest of the night, the whale slowly dances in the sky, and when morning comes and the waves subside, it goes back to the sea and swims close to shore. Once the Saryd is at the beach, he turns back to see the whale's tail hitting the water as it dives deep once again, and the curtains close.`
	"CN-8893" `	People in the audience start getting up and performing a short bow toward the stage, with both hands clenched together close to their chests, as if silently applauding the performance. Once most of them are done, they prepare to leave, and you follow them. Once you're back at the clearing, you return the small object back to its casket after seeing others do the same, and the organizers guide everyone back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-8894" `	Once there, the Saryd who first approached you says, "That you enjoyed the spectacle, I hope," and bids you farewell.`
	"CN-8895" `Shortly after entering the spaceport, you observe an Arach in what you guess is a formal "dress," a delicate silk wrap covering most of her body with each leg covered by its own embroidered skirt. She exclaims something loudly into a personal communication device before putting it away with a shove. Like everyone else who has momentarily been witness to this, you go to look away, but the Arach has cast their gaze around, seen you, and immediately begun to approach. "Our honorable human visitor, I salute," she says loudly as she closes the gap. "Say, Captain, appreciate the fine arts, do you? To a cultural soiree, I'm headed, but busy with work, dearest Papa is, so vacant, his reserved seat is. Accompany me, would you?"`
	"CN-8896" `	"Is that some sort of event?"`
	"CN-8897" `	"I'm busy right now, so I'll pass."`
	"CN-8898" `	"No simple gathering, but a collection of plays by esteemed professionals, completed by a dedicated orchestra, the soiree is," she explains. "A celebration of Arach folklore, it is, which in our finest outfits, us local patrons attend. Streamed live for others, the show also is, but compare to the live performance, it cannot."`
	"CN-8899" `	"Alright, I'm interested. Where is this 'soiree' taking place?"`
	"CN-8900" `	"I'm not a fan of plays, sorry."`
	"CN-8901" `	You follow her around the central portion of the city to a building which from the outside looks like some form of auditorium; there, some Arachi in uniform are seeing to the entries of the "patrons" of the event. "A human? Quite an exotic guest you've brought, lady Matlub," one of them says to your guide as she shows him a touchpad displaying two tickets. He verifies them and allows the two of you to enter. The inside reminds you of an opera house, with a large stage in front of dozens of rows of seats, and six levels of balconies on both sides. Matlub leads you to two excellent seats in one of the first few rows, and she helps you "adjust" the chair so that you're more comfortably seated. Just before the stage is an area a few steps below the level of the seats, with a few Arach musicians fine-tuning a variety of instruments. Up on the ceiling, and on all of the balconies, you see small cameras pointed at the stage to broadcast the event for those who didn't have the chance to attend it live.`
	"CN-8902" `	As the rows and balconies fill up with more guests, you notice a few Kimek and Saryds amidst the masses of Arachi, most of them accompanying an Arach patron; a few are seemingly patrons themselves, coming in on their own. A great many of them seem to take notice of you as you look around, but your patron studiously ignores the attention.`
	"CN-8903" `	"I can see why you were speaking so highly about this, looks like a really organized event."`
	"CN-8904" `	"Not every day that they see a human in one of these, I take it?"`
	"CN-8905" `	She nods. "A prestigious event, this is. Bring friends from all around the Coalition to watch, the patrons do. The most unique guest we've had, you are."`
	"CN-8906" `	Once all seats are filled, the doors are closed, and an Arach comes to the stage. "Welcome you, esteemed guests, to this celebration of saga and song, our theater does," he says. "Make you wait any longer, I shall not, so for our first play, a timeless classic dear to all, I present: Moonstruck."`
	"CN-8907" `	He quickly leaves the stage as the curtains open to reveal a rocky wall with two tunnels leading to the sides. The orchestra begins to play a slow, soft theme on accordion-like instruments, and a young Arach comes into the scene from the tunnel on the left. He hangs onto the rocky wall, a small lantern hanging from his abdomen and a large sack strapped to his back. The Arach then picks rocks from the corners of the wall, throwing most to the ground but placing a few inside the sack he carries. Once the sack is full, he enters the tunnel on the right, and the rocky wall is rotated to show the other side; there, the young miner is shown under the night sky smelting the ore he collected. As he looks to the top of the stage with his back facing the audience, the accordions grow quieter, a slow harp starts to play, and a full moon comes into view at the top of the background sky.`
	"CN-8908" `	The curtains close as the scene changes, opening again with the accordions picking up the pace. The Arach is now on a larger wall with only one tunnel from above. He claws away at the rocky corners, the accordions following his rhythm. Once he's dug out most of the ore, the wall starts shaking, as if the mine were collapsing. The accordions become erratic as he rushes for the escape tunnel. With a hectic clamor, the rock wall appears to disassemble on stage with great boulders descending gracefully from the fly tower, caving in the mine. The accordions stop, but after a long pause they, along with the harp, slowly pick up again. The young Arach then climbs into view and pushes first one boulder away, and then another, and another. This goes on until the Arach stands atop a mountain of metal carved out of the rock, reaching for the moon. As he nearly touches it, the curtains close and the music stops.`
	"CN-8909" `	The Arachi in the audience rub two of their legs together, as if clapping at the end of the performance. Shortly after, some get up, heading to the exit as the doors open up once again. At the same time, more patrons are coming in to fill the vacant seats. "Interested in only some of the plays, some patrons are, so only for those they wish to see, they stay," Matlub explains. "Leave after any of the performances, you may, if someplace else, you must be, but remain for the rest of the show, I will."`
	"CN-8910" `	(Stay for the next play.)`
	"CN-8911" `	Once everyone is seated, the same Arach from before goes to the stage again. "A surprise for you, tonight we have. A brand new play, an anonymous group of patrons commissioned. As a critique of one of the issues that persist in our society, described it is. For our second play: Babbling Bebliss."`
	"CN-8912" `	As he leaves, the curtains open to a set of an Arach street, where a child is purchasing some form of candy. From behind a building in the set, an Arach wearing tall, blue and white "socks" emerges as trumpets and tubas start playing an obnoxious track. He runs for the child and knocks the candy to the ground as he makes some gargling sound. Matlub sighs, saying, "Gibberish, it is. Nonsense, and words best left untranslated." The Arach actor goes on to cling to the walls of the building and grab things from inside the candy shop, throwing them wildly. By now, many well-dressed patrons, most likely members of House Bebliss, are getting up and leaving the theater. Meanwhile, a group of Arachi on one of the balconies doesn't even try to muffle their laughter.`
	"CN-8913" `	The scene continues as a couple comes to the set, walking down the street. As they're about to lean in for what looks like a kiss, the Arach leaps from the building, landing on the bachelor with a thud. He steals the kiss, as the tubas and trumpets blast as loudly as they can. After a while, the authorities show up, only for the Arach to make a run for it down the street. The orchestra plays a tune that is as uncoordinated as his movements, and the curtains close. Not many in the audience manifest themselves, most sighing or getting ready to leave, save for the group that was laughing earlier who are now very vocal in announcing their appreciation for the play. "Know of subtlety, House Chamgar does not," Matlub says. "A shame it is, that tainted the soiree with this rivalry, they have."`
	"CN-8914" `	The doors open once again as new patrons cycle in to watch the third play.`
	"CN-8915" `	Everyone takes their seats, and the Arach announcer heads to the stage again. "A cathartic tragedy, our third play of this evening is. For our next performance: 'Til Death."`
	"CN-8916" `	The stage lights go dark as the curtains open to a single spotlight. It illuminates an old Arach getting dressed inside a small shack on the right side of the stage. He coughs, and something akin to an organ begins to play a melancholic melody. Once he leaves, the shack is left in the dark as the spotlight follows him to the middle of the stage, where he makes his way carefully down an empty street. He is allowed to pass beyond the spotlight, which goes dark as the perspective shifts and a second spotlight renews the focus. The left side of the stage is finally lit up, where the Arach starts tending to a garden by the entrance of a manor. The organ stops its weeping every once in a while, right when the Arach is coughing, only to resume once he's done. Leaving the manor, a richly dressed Arach points to one of the flowers in the garden, showing it to be shriveled and dead. He plucks it and throws it to the ground before leaving. The gardener picks up the flower, sticks it inside his clothes, and continues his work.`
	"CN-8917" `	Once his work is done, he heads back to his shack, the spotlights following him as he moves around the stage. Once inside, he looks inside a small box, taking a simple vase and placing the flower inside it. The stage goes dark as he goes to sleep and the piano stops, with only the occasional cough echoing throughout the theater. When the light comes to the shack again, the Arach slowly gets up and again leaves for his job, pausing for a moment on the street part of the stage during a heavy coughing fit. Once he's done with the work and begins going back home, he starts coughing again, not letting up for more than a second at a time. During this the spotlights transition to the next section of the stage, and the piano plays a brief note. Once inside his shack, he collapses, knocking down the flower vase in the process. The piano plays a few slow chords, and the last spotlight goes out during the final note.`
	"CN-8918" `	You hear the curtains closing, and the lights of the theater turn back on again as the audience is taken by a round of applause. Once they've settled, the announcer goes up to the stage again. "And with that, concluded, our soiree is. Thank you all for gracing us with your presence, I, in name of the theater, do." He lowers his head in a bow and leaves the stage again as nearly all of the patrons in the audience get up and head for the exit, this time with nobody else coming in to take their seats. At the same time, the orchestra starts packing up their instruments. There are, however, a few who remain in their seats, including Matlub.`
	"CN-8919" `	(Stay.)`
	"CN-8920" `	You thank Matlub for inviting you here, and while she doesn't seem to pay you much mind, you can feel the gazes of other Arach patrons on you, whispering among themselves as you leave.`
	"CN-8921" `	The theater workers leave one after the other, leaving you and the other guests with an empty stage. After a while, the lights are turned off. A couple minutes later, however, you hear the curtains open, as some violins start to play in unison. Their music doesn't come from where the orchestra was seated, but as if they were all over the theater, behind you and even up on the balconies. A strong light comes from the stage, most of it blocked by a tall, dark figure. It isn't an actor, however, instead seeming to be made out of wooden parts kept up by thin wires you can barely spot when looking at the top of the stage. The violins' song is disrupted by dull, successive drum hits, at which point the figure moves, with its "arms" opening to the sides; it becomes even taller as it stands up. It is a humanoid creature, and it begins to slowly move around the stage, as if dancing in a pendulum. Cellos join in with the violin screams, and are followed by a choir, though you cannot understand their words. You do recognize, however, that it isn't being sung in any language of the Coalition.`
	"CN-8922" `	The creature appears to get closer to the audience, growing in size, and as the choir and instruments become more intense, it swings one of its arms upward and removes the wires. Despite this, it stays upright and continues to move. It brings both arms close and strikes its own head to form two small holes which the background light shines through. Then, it falls to its knees, with one arm reaching for the audience, as the light behind it turns off and the choir and music subside.`
	"CN-8923" `	The lights turn back on, revealing curtains still open, but nothing on the stage. A few workers come in to tidy up the place, and the remaining guests now get up to leave. "Enjoyed the soiree, have you, Captain?" Matlub asks, as she herself gets up to leave. "Come now, actually over, the show now is."`
	"CN-8924" `	"What the hell was that thing?"`
	"CN-8925" `	"If it only ended now, why did that announcer come up after the third play to dismiss the guests?"`
	"CN-8926" `	She doesn't answer, heading straight for the exit. You follow her outside, and she guides you back to your ship. "Thankful for you accompanying me, I am, Captain. Safe travels, may you have."`
	"CN-8927" `A Kimek flags you down when you enter the spaceport. "Busy are you, Captain?" he asks. "Taking place today, a cultural festival is, and participate in it, anyone can. A reenactment of the old 'Spring Siege' folk tale, it is. Play the part of one of the characters, anyone can."`
	"CN-8928" `	"That sounds like fun. Where is it being held?"`
	"CN-8929" `	"Sorry, I'm too busy right now for that."`
	"CN-8930" `	He asks you to follow him, and the two of you board a train leading to another section of the city, where you exit the train at the edge of a large park. There, you see that many sets of camps dot the savanna plains, and an equal number of wooden forts stare down from the top of a long hill. Each "set" of fort and camp is separated from the others by many patches of vegetation that go up the hill.`
	"CN-8931" `	You follow the Kimek for a while longer until he finds you a pairing of camp and fort that have a vacant spot in either side. "Well Captain, choose a side to play as, you must. The hang of it, you will get, once started, the event has, but as a quick summary, take the 'crops' inside the fort before time runs out, the attacking team must. Prevent them from doing that, the defenders must. At the end, rewarded, the victors are."`
	"CN-8932" `	"I'll join the attackers."`
	"CN-8933" `	"I'll join the defenders."`
	"CN-8934" `	"Hang on, if this is a folk tale, how come you're reenacting it as if any side could win?"`
	"CN-8935" `	He chitters, as if expecting the question. "Witnessed by a minstrel, the battle was. Traveling on fields like these, he was, before the fort and the raider camp, he spotted in the distance. Hid himself in foliage close to the scene, he had, and writing and painting it as it happened, he was. When reached its climax, the battle had, swept up by the wind, many flowers were, and block his vision they did. Once settled down the wind had, over, the battle was. Spring it was, so 'Spring Siege' became the story's title."`
	"CN-8936" `	Seeing you have more questions now, he continues. "Silly and nonsensical at times, the story is. Know that, we do, and that simply looking to entertain a crowd, the minstrel was, but with all forms of classic tales, is that not the case?" He chitters some more, and looks at the group up on the hill and the other in the camp, before continuing. "Foreign as it might seem, participate in it, will you not? Perhaps like it, you might."`
	"CN-8937" `	"Alright, I'll join the attackers."`
	"CN-8938" `	"Alright, I'll join the defenders."`
	"CN-8939" `	He brings you to the small fort up the hill. Its gates open as those inside (mostly Kimek as expected, but also a couple Arachi and a lone Saryd) are still getting ready. A small "farm" sits in the middle, with plastic replicas serving as the crops. The walls of the fort are made of various tall logs, densely covered by tufts of vicious, reddish thorns nearly as long as your arm. Inside, you can see that a higher level with battlements is accessible via staircases on either side of the courtyard; you also notice that the defenders are all wearing a green strip of cloth over their clothing. Another Kimek organizer, wearing a rugged leather vest that you assume is the Kimek equivalent of medieval armor, comes to meet you both at the gate. He greets his colleague, who introduces you and says that you have chosen to join the defenders, before heading back down the hill.`
	"CN-8940" `	"Glad to have you as part of the garrison, our fort is," the armored Kimek begins. "Told about the enemy's objective, I assume you have been. Protect our farm, we must, so allow the produce to be stolen, we cannot." He tells you to follow him to the "keep," a shack too small for any non-Kimek, and gives you a long piece of green cloth. He then informs you that it is meant to be worn, so that others can tell what team you are on. As you wrap it around you like a scarf, you notice that, behind the shack, there is a smaller gate that grants entry to the fort. Once you're done, he gives you a brief tour of the rest of the fort, taking you up the battlements and above the main gate, where you see buckets of what at first appears to be water. Your guide informs you that the liquid inside is actually quite slick, and during the re-enactment, it is poured downhill to slow the attackers.`
	"CN-8941" `	Once he's done, he tells you to wait in the courtyard, as the "battle" will begin soon. A few minutes pass before a loud whistle blows, and the Kimek in charge of the fort tells everyone that the other side has begun their attack. The front gate is closed, and some of the defenders begin placing heavy objects behind to barricade it; others are already up by the battlements, waiting for the right time to use the buckets of slippery liquid.`
	"CN-8942" `	(Help reinforce the main gate.)`
	"CN-8943" `	(Go help slow down the attackers.)`
	"CN-8944" `	You join the others in gathering and moving heavy objects, and quickly find some crates behind the small shack, which a couple of Arachi help bring to the gate. Some Kimek take logs they find stashed under a staircase and bring them as well, burying one end in the ground with the other end against the door. The liquid poured on the attackers does slow them down for some minutes, but once you're done, they're already banging at the gate. Most of those inside the fort, particularly the Saryd that has joined in, head to the main gate to try and keep it closed, but a few Kimek head around the back to check on the smaller gate.`
	"CN-8945" `	(Help keep the main gate closed.)`
	"CN-8946" `	(Go with the others and check the back gate.)`
	"CN-8947" `	Once you get to the back gate, you and the Kimek there stay quiet and try to listen for anyone approaching this side of the fort. Sure enough, you hear scuttling Kimek legs swishing through the grass as the attackers come circling around. Fortunately, not many came to this gate, so, with your help, your Kimek teammates don't have much trouble keeping the gate closed. Thanks to the main gate having been reinforced, the group there holds well enough that some more come to the back to help, and after some minutes of struggling with the attackers on the gate, another whistle is sounded. It marks that time has run out and that the defenders have won.`
	"CN-8948" `	With the fortifications from earlier helping keep it shut, holding the main gate proves easy enough. After a few minutes pass, however, you hear a commotion from behind the shack. As you and others go there to check, you arrive to see the small gate open, the attackers, wearing blue sashes in place of your team's green, having already made their way inside. The whistle sounds again, marking the end of the battle and the victory of the attackers.`
	"CN-8949" `	You go up the stairs and are given one of the buckets with the slippery substance. You notice that the others up here are all Kimek and Arachi, however, and they are only pouring the liquid down directly in front of the gate. When you see some of the blue sash wearing attackers advancing from the sides, where the liquid hasn't been poured, you chuck a bucket their way. This leaves a line of the liquid on that side, and those attacking from there lose their footing, tripping and falling again and again. Once your teammates realize what you've done, they begin to egg you on, encouraging you to throw more buckets to cover the sides while they continue to drench the middle. Despite your efforts, however, the attackers do eventually make it up the hill and start banging at the gate. Most of those inside the fort, including the Saryd, head to the main gate to try and keep it closed, but some Kimek instead head around the back to check on the smaller gate.`
	"CN-8950" `	Once you get to the back gate, you and the Kimek there stay quiet and try to listen for anyone approaching this side of the fort. Sure enough, you hear scuttling Kimek legs swishing through the grass as the attackers come circling around. Fortunately, not many came to this gate, so, with your help, your Kimek teammates don't have much trouble keeping the gate closed. The group at the front gate isn't so lucky, however, and after a brief minute, the whistle sounds again. Your group comes back to the courtyard to find that the gate has been busted open and that the attackers with their blue sashes have won.`
	"CN-8951" `	At first, holding the gate isn't too troublesome, but after a few minutes pass, it starts being pounded by some form of battering ram, and before long the group there can't hold it closed. At the same time, you hear a commotion from behind the shack, and as you and others go there to check, you arrive to see the small gate open. The attackers having made their way inside via both gates, the whistle sounds again, marking the end of the battle and the victory of the other side.`
	"CN-8952" `	He brings you to the nearby camp, where many Kimek, Arachi, and even a few Saryds are gathered for the event. Most of them are waiting in anticipation inside one of the tents, or looking up at the fort; all of them have long, blue strips of cloth over their own clothing. Once she notices you two, another Kimek organizer, donning what looks like a thin gambeson, comes to say hello. She greets her colleague, who then introduces you and tells her you have chosen to join the attackers, before leaving the camp to welcome a family who has come to watch the event.`
	"CN-8953" `	"Honored to have you fight alongside us, our company is," the armored Kimek begins. "Told about our objective, I assume you have been. Break into the fort, we must, before up the time is. Ten minutes, we have, once started, the battle has." She tells you to follow her to the "war tent," one that's slightly larger than the others around it. There she gives you a long piece of blue cloth and informs you that it is meant to be worn so that others can tell what team you are on. Wrapping it around your neck like a scarf while you look around the main tent, you see that there is a stumpy log reinforced with metal bits stored here, which the Kimek tells you will be used as a battering ram to force open the gates. She then has you follow her to the edge of the camp to show you the limits of this "set," which is marked by patches of vegetation meant to indicate the boundaries of the game. "Also, discourage anyone from trying it, the thorns should, but against the rules, it is, to crawl up the walls of the fort, so-" She pauses, looking at you as if just realizing that such a thing is impossible for you. "Sorry, out of habit, I said it. Participate in this event, not many groundlocked people do; few Saryds here I've met. Even fewer humans, as imagine, you can."`
	"CN-8954" `	Once she's done, she says you're free to roam the camp as you wait for the "battle" to begin. A few minutes pass before a loud whistle blows, and the Kimek in charge of the camp tells everyone that the time has come. She leads the charge up the hill, with most of those from the camp following her. Others split into smaller groups and instead move up along the trees that separate the sets, trying to approach the fort from the sides.`
	"CN-8955" `	(Charge with the main group.)`
	"CN-8956" `	(Take the longer side route.)`
	"CN-8957" `	You follow the lead of the Kimek and start to run straight up the hill, directly at the fort. Once you get closer, however, you see the defenders, garbed in strips of green cloth as opposed to your blue, pouring out buckets of what looks like water. As it flows down the hill to meet your steps, though, you immediately lose your balance and your feet slip out from under you, and you slide a short distance back down the hill. You get up, but, try it as you may, you cannot find stable footing in the wet grass, instead having to step on the few tufts that have grown too high for the liquid to cover them. Even with all their legs, the Kimek and Saryds fare no better, and find themselves in similar trouble, losing their balance again and again. Only the Arachi can press onward, digging down into the dirt beneath the grass with half their legs at each step. They slowly but surely help you and the others move up, and eventually you reach the gate, only to find that the groups that came from the sides are already working on busting it open. You can also see what the Kimek meant when she spoke of "thorns;" tufts of vicious, reddish barbs nearly as long as your arm cover the logs that make up the walls.`
	"CN-8958" `	(Try and find another way in.)`
	"CN-8959" `	(Help the others bust the gate open.)`
	"CN-8960" `	You start pushing along with the others, the Saryds joining you from below, and the Kimek and Arachi crawling up to push at the top of the gate. They take turns with each others when one gets tired so that someone is always pushing, even though their attempts aren't the most effective. After a while, you hear a cracking noise, and the gate finally begins budging slightly, as if something barricading it had broken off. As the latecomers of the main force come up, bringing with them the battering ram, everyone makes way for them to begin hammering it against the gate. The gate shudders with each hit and gradually begins to give even more, but even the battering ram team cannot break through fast enough as the whistle from the start of the event sounds again. Evidently this means that time has run out, and the defenders have won.`
	"CN-8961" `	You and a part of the group stick close to the walls and follow along them to the other side, careful not to scratch yourself on the thorns along the fort. You soon find another, smaller gate, and begin pushing. Unlike what you can see of the efforts you left at the main gate, you can feel this one budging immediately, and there is no slick ground to worry about. Once they realize the vulnerability of this gate, the Saryds in the group ask others to move out of the way. You are a bit startled as they suddenly charge it in unison, almost forcing it open with a single concerted effort. More defenders come to hold it, though, and the gate becomes increasingly difficult to move any further. One Arach heads back to the main group to call for more help, but when they arrive, so do more defenders. The struggle continues for many minutes, with the attackers alongside you unable to make a final breakthrough. The whistle sounds again, marking the end of the battle, announcing that the defenders have won.`
	"CN-8962" `	You follow a group to the edges of this set, losing some time before beginning your run up the hill. Once you finally start making your way up, you turn to see the main group repeatedly tripping and falling back. It seems the defenders, who are wearing green identifiers instead of blue, are pouring some slippery liquid down from the battlements above the gate, slowing those that are coming along a direct path. You reach the top while the main force still struggles, and your group makes its way to the gate. On your way, you see what the Kimek meant when she spoke of "thorns," with closely-spaced tufts of vicious, reddish barbs nearly as long as your arm covering the logs that make up the walls. You reach the gate, but as you push and push, it refuses to budge even the slightest bit, clearly having been barricaded from the inside. The main group eventually catches up to you, but even with many more people pushing now, the gate still holds firm and unmoving.`
	"CN-8963" `	(Continue trying to bust the gate open.)`
	"CN-8964" `	You and a part of the group stick close to the walls and follow along them to the other side, careful not to scratch yourself on the thorns along the fort. You soon find another, smaller gate, and begin pushing. Unlike what you can see of the efforts you left at the main gate, you can feel this one budging immediately, and there is no slick ground to worry about. Once they realize the vulnerability of this gate, the Saryds in the group ask others to move out of the way. You are a bit startled as they suddenly charge it in unison, almost forcing it open with a single concerted effort. More defenders come to hold it, though, and the gate becomes increasingly difficult to move any further. One Arach heads back to the main group to call for more help, but when they arrive, so do more defenders. The struggle continues for a while, before you hear loud bangs from the other side of the fort. The Kimek organizer comes around the back to tell everyone to return to the main entrance. As you come to the main gate, you see the battering ram has forced the main gate open, something that must've been made easier with so many leaving it unguarded to instead defend the back gate. With that, the whistle sounds again, marking the end of the battle, announcing that the attackers have won.`
	"CN-8965" `	The Kimek organizer in charge of your side starts a cheer, which quickly spreads to the others. After the leaders of both teams meet to greet each other, everyone is asked to return the colored cloth they were given and make their way down the hill. Your group is pointed to a nearby building to wash off any dirt, if needed. Once you're all cleaned up, you head back to the camp, where the Kimek who brought you here is waiting to guide your group to many short tables with plates on them; apparently, the reward for winning is a feast. As most of those who participate are Kimek, almost all of the food comes the way they prefer it: a soupy, half-digested mess. Thankfully there are a few meals prepared the way the other species like them, meaning you can pick one prepared for Saryds; their meals are the closest you can get to human cuisine here.`
	"CN-8966" `	The Saryd first course offered consists of many cooked vegetables, arranged in a little mound on the plate, with a thin trail of steam still coming from them. Talking with the organizers, you learn that the meals are meant to represent the produce of the fort's "farm," and that those who win earn the right to the banquet. Once you're done eating, you return to where the train dropped you off and get on the next one heading back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-8967" `	The Kimek organizer of the other side starts a cheer, which quickly spreads to the others. After the leaders of both teams meet to greet each other, everyone is asked to return the colored cloth they were given and make their way down the hill. Your group is pointed to a nearby building to wash off any dirt, if needed. Once you're all cleaned up, the Kimek who brought you here is waiting by the camp to guide your opponents to many short tables with plates on them; apparently, the reward for winning is a feast. "A shame it is, that lost the battle your team has," he says. "But hopefully, still fun with the event you had."`
	"CN-8968" `	Before he leaves with the victors, he explains a bit more about the event, telling you that the meals that will be served at the banquet are meant to represent the produce of the fort's "farm," and that those who win earn the right to it. Finally, he thanks you for participating, and goes with the winners to the tables. You return to where the train dropped you off and get on the next one heading back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-8969" `Your ship narrowly avoids a few small Coalition vessels as you exit <origin>'s atmosphere. Not a second later, while you're still stunned by the near-crash, once again the <ship> is almost hit by incoming ships, this time Heliarch warships, in what looks like an intense chase after the ships from before.`
	"CN-8970" `	After they've all passed, you check your comms and radar, finding some other civilian ships nearby that seem to have experienced a similar shock of their own. Some of the ships linger over <origin> for a while, as if unsure of what to do. Others bolt away with engines at full power, leaving the system in a blink, and some eventually decide to land again, either too curious about the situation, or perhaps wanting to avoid any trouble.`
	"CN-8971" `	Some more minutes later, you see a select few of the Heliarch ships that passed close to you departing the planet. They pay you no mind, and much to your relief steer a safe distance from your ship this time.`
	"CN-8972" `	Some more minutes later, you see a select few of the Heliarch ships that passed close to you departing the planet, steering a safe distance from your ship this time. The captain of one of the ships, a Heliarch Interdictor, hails you, apologizing for the earlier distress, briefly mentioning they've gotten the situation back under control. They wish you a good day, and prepare to leave the system.`
	"CN-8973" `	Some more minutes later, you see a select few of the Heliarch ships that passed close to you departing the planet. They pay you no mind, and much to your relief steer a safe distance away from your ship this time. You cannot help but wonder whether the ships they were chasing held any Lunarium members, or if they were simply more unfortunate civilians.`
	"CN-8974" `Once you're a good distance from <origin>, your sensors alert you to danger in the system: several explosions and a torrent of projectiles are flying nearby. You swiftly ready yourself and prepare for the threat, only to find Coalition civilian ships blowing up near the middle of the system. Some Heliarch warships are in their midst, moving from one to the other, unbothered by the ship debris as vessels explode around them.`
	"CN-8975" `	They appear to be boarding the few ships that weren't damaged enough to have their hulls ruptured. After a few short minutes, they seem to have seized control of the vessels, and are having them follow the warships out of the system.`
	"CN-8976" `	One of the ships hails you briefly, apparently in a cheery mood as they celebrate having captured the criminals. They wish you a good day and good luck on your duties, and cut the comms as they prepare to leave.`
	"CN-8977" `	As you glance at the wreckage of the civilian ships, you feel uneasy. Worse still is the thought that hits you soon after, of whether any of the Lunarium leaders you met were aboard any of the ships.`
	"CN-8978" `You depart to find something like a screen of Heliarch warships around <origin>, circling it and approaching all departing civilian ships. It's no different with your <ship>, and soon enough you're hailed by a Heliarch Punisher approaching your position.`
	"CN-8979" `	"Salutations, Captain <last>. Performing a routine inspection, we are. Board you momentarily we shall, to verify the safety of your vessel, then leave you to your business we shall."`
	"CN-8980" `	They sign off before you can respond, and the Punisher readies to board the <ship>, as more warships gather around the scene. Dozens of armed Heliarch agents march into your ship silently, diligently going about checking the bunks, cockpit, engine room...`
	"CN-8981" `	Within a few minutes, they appear satisfied with turning your ship upside down, and all march back to the Punisher. They thank you for "cooperating," and the ships clear the way for you to move out.`
	"CN-8982" `	They sign off before you can respond, and the Punisher readies to board the <ship> as more warships gather around the scene. Although you're not currently performing any tasks for the Lunarium, you still grow increasingly worried as the Punisher approaches and connects to your ship. You do your best to keep a calm profile as dozens of armed Heliarch agents march into your ship silently, diligently going about checking the bunks, cockpit, engine room...`
	"CN-8983" `	Within a few minutes, they appear satisfied with turning your ship upside down, and all march back to the Punisher. They thank you for "cooperating", and the ships clear the way for you to move out. Once they're well enough away from the <ship>, you take to scouring it for anything they might've left behind to keep tabs within your ship. Much later on in the day, after you've confirmed to have found nothing of the sort, you breathe a sigh of relief.`
	"CN-8984" `You see an Arach captain hurrying around the spaceport, speaking with anyone who will listen. He converses with each one briefly, showing something in a small monitor, and then moving on to the next shortly after. After a while, he gets to you.`
	"CN-8985" `	"Captain? A moment if free you are?" He asks, scrambling his legs to light up the monitor. It displays a picture of a young Kimek. "A passenger of mine. Stopped by here to drop a few Saryd pilgrims, we had, but after seen them off I had, find this Kimek back in my ship, I couldn't!" He exclaims, pointing to an Arach Transport parked just before the edge of where <origin>'s dense fog cuts off your view. "Seen him anywhere, have you?"`
	"CN-8986" `	"Sorry, I haven't. Did you try getting in touch with the local Heliarchs?"`
	"CN-8987" `	"Sorry, but I haven't seen him either."`
	"CN-8988" `	He nods. "Contacted them a few hours ago, I had. Look for my passenger in the restricted sections, I wished to, but allowed there I am not, so figured that ask them for aid, I could." He sighs. "Filed a report and sent a few agents off to look for him, they did, but so far received any word from them, I have not."`
	"CN-8989" `	He thanks you all the same for listening to him, and moves on to the next person in the spaceport to inquire about the missing Kimek.`
	"CN-8990" `The spaceport here on <origin> is in something of an uproar. Thousands of Kimek are seemingly organized in what, strangely enough for a world in the Coalition, resembles a protest. Some carry devices repeatedly displaying a message in the Kimek language. Others hold signs depicting the usual Kimek diet, with their many crops sharing space with a few fish. Strangest of all, however, is how the local Heliarchs are handling the situation: they appear almost hesitant, defensively speaking to the civilians in attempts to calm them down, sometimes apologizing or simply being forced to listen to the complaints as several Kimek pile up around them.`
	"CN-8991" `	When you finally manage to find a Heliarch who isn't occupied trying to keep the area in order, a Saryd, he explains the situation. "Missed its delivery, a food convoy has. Still investigating the issue, we are; know only that, somehow, gone missing, the entire fleet has..." He sighs, shaking his head. "Keep the locals calm we must." He goes on to help the other Heliarchs, without another word.`
	"CN-8992" `	Within a few minutes that must've felt like hours for the stationed Heliarch agents, battalions of drones start making their way from the tallest building in the city - the hunger tower. Ferrying around several meals each, with impressive precision, the drones fly throughout the civilian mass, distributing the meals. Hundreds of larger ones head to the residential areas of the city, presumably to provide the necessary supplies for the citizens until the next food convoy arrives. Seemingly satisfied, for the moment at least, the Kimek gradually dissipate out of the spaceport and back to their homes, leaving the spaceport to the now exhausted Heliarch agents.`
	"CN-8993" `A Heliarch patrol seems to be discussing with an Arach shop worker in front of a large, prestigious looking Arach clothing store in the spaceport. Other agents prevent you and other bystanders from approaching the scene, but you can still make out some context from their gesturing. It seems the Heliarchs are there to confiscate some pieces from the shop that you guess don't abide by their laws, while the shop worker keeps worryingly attempting to answer what questions they pose him.`
	"CN-8994" `	Eventually, the shop owner arrives. Judging by her fine clothes, and from the reactions of the local Arachi, you figure she must either be really famous here on <origin>, or possibly belong to one of the Arach Houses, though nothing on her attire seems to indicate any specific house. She helps the worker calm down, and then she engages in conversation with the Heliarch agents as he heads back inside.`
	"CN-8995" `	She tries to diffuse the situation, speaking calmly and attempting to take the items back into the shop, but the Heliarch agents do not budge. Running out of patience, the Heliarch in charge of the patrol cuts the Arach lady off as she's speaking, forcibly taking all the items in question, and having the agents rip apart what you guess must've been the offending parts of the cloth pieces. Stunned, the Arach simply watches as they render most of the items into unusable rags, keeping the bits they hacked away, and handing her back the other tattered remains. Without another word, they leave the scene. The Arach heads inside, and you can hear the door slam from where you're standing.`
	"CN-8996" `A few minutes into your walk around the spaceport of the <origin>, the lighting suddenly shifts from the usual, comfortable tones to a cacophony of flashing warnings. Diagnostic warning messages display on all sorts of screens, and siren blasts are interrupted only by alarm messages in all three Coalition languages on repeat. You notice that not only are the civilians in the ring as alarmed as you, but every Heliarch agent you can see begins moving in a hurried, albeit organized pace, towards restricted sections, Heliarch-only rooms and warehouses.`
	"CN-8997" `	It doesn't take long before hundreds of other Heliarchs come pouring in from other sections of the ring. When the stream finally stops, you see them take control of the machinery near the edge of the ring section, activating a huge retractable barrier that seals this section off from the rest of the ring. Ship traffic is also cut off entirely, with Heliarch squadrons keeping any ship from departing, and warships visibly walling off the hangar entrances. The Heliarchs organize the civilians swiftly, moving them away from an area where most of the agents are gathering.`
	"CN-8998" `	As you too are herded away by the agents, you manage to get some context out of one of them - a Heliarch team that was exploring one of the ring's unknown sections had some sort of accident, and one of the members is expected to return at the area where most of the agents are gathering. The Heliarchs stand armed and ready, pointing their weapons toward a door leading to the restricted sections, and as if rendered mute by anticipation, all in the quarantined ring section appear to hold their breath, waiting.`
	"CN-8999" `	Sure enough, the many minutes of silence are disrupted by echoing, increasingly louder screaming - one scream, incessant, coming from the shut passageway watched over by the sights of what must be a hundred Heliarch guns. A thud at the shut door briefly peaks out amidst the continuous shout. It opens to a lone, frantic Saryd, with a deeply perturbed look in his eyes. He doesn't stop at the sight of the several gun barrels pointed at him, instead drawing his own weapon, only to point it back to where he came from, firing wildly at the dark passage.`
	"CN-9000" `	Then it stops. The screaming, and the gunshots, both stop abruptly, and the Saryd drops the gun, then collapses to the ground. He lays there, unresponsive, catatonic, as the Heliarch agents head closer to inspect him, eventually blocking him out entirely from view. A few seconds later, some of the Heliarchs back up, then bolt to a restricted room. Others stand firmly on guard, with their guns pointed either at the Saryd, or at the passageway from which he came.`
	"CN-9001" `	Eventually, a team comes with what vaguely resembles a very large gurney, and some sort of large sack. The Heliarch agents surrounding the Saryd shuffle out of the way for those carrying the equipment to pass, and within a few minutes they're taking the Saryd away, encased in the sack as if in a body bag, carried on the gurney. Halfway to the shut down section doors, they stop as the Saryd moves erratically inside the sack, kicking and flailing wildly. It stops within a few seconds, and they resume their way out of the quarantined ring portion.`
	"CN-9002" `	Several minutes pass before the Heliarch agents deem the passageway from where the Saryd ran from to be secure, sending some squads inside while others move to resume the ring section to normal. Once the quarantine is lifted, nearly all civilians rush to their ships, departing immediately.`
	"CN-9003" `The Heliarchs thank you profusely when they see you've taken them up on their offer, and soon enough several of their ships have landed near your own. Apparently they've learned of your change of mind and are excited to see the exchange, leaving their ships and surrounding yours. Soon enough, they make space for an army of engineers to come and remove the spare jump drive from your ship. Still watching the scene, only now in formations, the Heliarch agents whisper among themselves, rarely shifting their eyes, as if looking at a spectacle.`
	"CN-9004" `	Once the drive is out of your ship, it is secured in an excessively reinforced container and transported to a restricted section of the ring, under the guard of hundreds of armed soldiers. One of the Heliarchs who seem to be in charge of the procedure, an Arach, personally comes to you, thanking you again and handing you <payment>. "Honor us you do with such generosity, Captain. Though made great progress in studying jump drives and their mechanisms, we have, still incapable of creating our own, we are, and means of acquiring new copies we have not. Tremendously valuable, each and every drive you could bring us is. If interested in selling any more jump drives, you are, continue to offer you such jobs, we will."`
	"CN-9005" `	She thanks you yet again, salutes, and leaves to follow the entourage guarding the newly purchased jump drive.`
	"CN-9006" `	She thanks you yet again, salutes, and leaves to follow the entourage guarding the newly purchased jump drive. Not a minute after she has left, three more Heliarchs arrive at your ship, a delegation consisting of a member of each of the three Coalition species, all wearing golden circlets denoting their rank and authority. "A most unexpected, but greatly value contribution this is," the Saryd says, "to think that so eager would our visitor be to prove their diligence and commitment."`
	"CN-9007" `	The Kimek says, "As aided you have our society in breaking free of the Quarg's cages, with our society's technology may you be trusted."`
	"CN-9008" `	"But," says the Arach, "like all civilians, even citizens, to you our weapons and warships we still cannot sell."`
	"CN-9009" `	"Why don't you allow civilians to purchase weapons or warships?"`
	"CN-9010" `	"For the sake of peace it is," says the Saryd. "The Heliarch military, well-trained to use weapons only for defense and only for justice, they are. And to place the needs of the Coalition over the ambitions of their own native species, each one committed is. No such discipline do civilians have, even you. But as a respectful guest you are, to maintain your weapons we shall allow."`
	"CN-9011" `	Apparently nothing is for sale here, but they assure you that many Coalition worlds will now grant you access to their shipyards and outfitters. The three Heliarchs all express their deep gratitude for your generosity with providing them a fresh jump drive, and wish you well.`
	"CN-9012" `This planet seems to be inhabited by at least three different sentient species. First are giant beetles, about a meter tall, who scurry quickly toward your ship and swarm around it, gawking at you, as soon as you land. The second species, even more disturbing than the beetles, are giant spiders. And the third species are centaurs. Not just something vaguely resembling centaurs; they look like they could have stepped right off the page of a story book from ancient Earth.`
	"CN-9013" `	One of the spiders walks up to you, stretching its legs to raise its face and many eyes to the level of your own face, and says something to you in a gloopy sort of burbling language that you don't understand. The beetles, meanwhile, are talking to each other in a different language, all clicks and chittering. And the centaur stands quietly at a distance and keeps glancing back toward the spaceport as if waiting for someone.`
	"CN-9014" `	And eventually, someone does arrive: a beetle, a spider, and a centaur all wearing yellow armbands, small, triangle-shaped metal headpieces, and some sort of electric box hanging on a chain around each of their necks. They walk up to you, and the centaur speaks. After a brief delay, the box around its neck says, "In the name of the Heliarchs, who drove out the oppressors, who maintain peace, we the human visitor greet."`
	"CN-9015" `	The spider speaks, and the box around its neck translates. "Our nearest and most recent neighbor you are. The Heliarchs in their great wisdom, all things that come to pass in our region of space, they are aware of."`
	"CN-9016" `	Speaking through its own translation box, the beetle says, "To the seat of the Heliarch government must you go. Once to the Heliarchs you have become known, in many ways to our society, contribute you may."`
	"CN-9017" `	The centaur pulls out a map printed on a thin sheet of plastic. You recognize it as a star map of this region. Lines mark out three different territories, and where they meet are three star systems colored yellow. The centaur points to the southernmost of the three. "Where you must go, here it is," they say.`
	"CN-9018" `	"Thank you. I will go there."`
	"CN-9019" `	"Can you tell me more about yourselves, first?"`
	"CN-9020" `	The spider says, "The wise Heliarchs, all your questions they will answer."`
	"CN-9021" `	Eventually the crowd disperses and allows you to visit the spaceport, although no one offers you any jobs or the opportunity to buy anything but basic commodities. Perhaps you need to register with the "Heliarchs" first.`
	"CN-9022" `Your first view of the landing area confirms beyond a doubt that this is a Quarg ringworld, not just an imitation of one. The interior architecture is unmistakable. But no Quarg are present here, only the three species of the Coalition. Soon after you land, a delegation approaches your ship: again, one of each species, but these are wearing golden circlets around their heads. The circlets are not merely decorative, but seem to contain some electronics as well.`
	"CN-9023" `	Again, the centaur speaks first. "To our territory, to welcome you we are glad," they say.`
	"CN-9024" `	The beetle says, "With our people you may mingle. The beauty of our culture, you may experience."`
	"CN-9025" `	The spider adds, "Our people and yours perhaps one day may trade. Perhaps one day the humans our great and free Coalition may join."`
	"CN-9026" `	"Tell me more about your Coalition."`
	"CN-9027" `	"Is this a Quarg ringworld? Where are the Quarg?"`
	"CN-9028" `	The centaur says, "Like you, our three species once, by the Quarg were ruled. But with each other, connections we made. An alliance we formed, and the oppressors we drove away. For six thousand Earth years now, in prosperity and freedom from Quarg constraint and in friendship with each other we have lived."`
	"CN-9029" `	"The Quarg don't seem that oppressive to me."`
	"CN-9030" `	"How did you defeat the Quarg?"`
	"CN-9031" `	The spider says, "Alone, no species all skills or all knowledge possesses. But when our abilities we combine, powerful we may become. That, the reason is, that the Quarg all species in isolation keep."`
	"CN-9032" `	The spider says, "In separate boxes, they each species keep. And in subtle ways, your development and discoveries they limit. And on your technology, restrictions they place."`
	"CN-9033" `	The beetle says, "Or, wrong are we? And the jump drive that brought you here, a gift from the Quarg it is? They its secret no longer hoard?" You tell them that the Quarg do indeed refuse to give jump drives to humans, and they say, "Then, prisoners indeed you are."`
	"CN-9034" `	"I suppose you may be right about the Quarg."`
	"CN-9035" `	"Perhaps the Quarg will change their minds in the future."`
	"CN-9036" `	The giant beetle considers you gravely. "Hope, we can only," they say.`
	"CN-9037" `	"But, the Quarg do let the humans and the Hai make contact with each other."`
	"CN-9038" `	This, apparently, is news to them. You explain to them who the Hai are, and that some humans have made contact with them and are living in their territory. "A second Coalition you are forming!" says the centaur, tapping their hooves on the floor in excitement. "Once again, foiled the Quarg are. A secret way for species to work together, they have overlooked. Great things, from this may come."`
	"CN-9039" `	You talk with them for a while longer, and learn that the centaurs are called "Saryds," and are the oldest of the three species. The beetles are the "Kimek," and come next, and the spiders are called "Arachi," and were the last of the three to discover spaceflight.`
	"CN-9040" `	They tell you that the best way to learn more about them is to visit their worlds, and to see for yourself how the three species live in friendship and equality. They also offer to give you jobs to do in their territory, so that you may become a "valuable contributor" to their society.`
	"CN-9041" `A Heliarch agent contacts you soon after you land, and says, "In many useful ways, among us you have been working. The Heliarchs you should petition, and your rights and status among us they may elevate." The agent instructs you to return to the <planet> and petition the Heliarch rulers there.`
	"CN-9042" `Once again, when you exit your ship you are met by a member of each of the three Coalition species, wearing the golden circlets that mark them as Heliarchs. "Told we have been," says the Saryd, "that among us with great diligence and commitment, small tasks you have performed."`
	"CN-9043" `	The Kimek says, "Those who in our society's prosperity have invested, with our society's technology may be trusted."`
	"CN-9044" `	"For the sake of peace it is," says the Saryd. "The Heliarch military, well trained to use weapons only for defense and only for justice, they are. And to place the needs of the Coalition over the ambitions of their own native species, each one committed is. No such discipline do civilians have, even you. But as a respectful guest you are, to maintain your weapons we shall allow."`
	"CN-9045" `	Apparently nothing is for sale here, but they assure you that many Coalition worlds will now grant you access to their shipyards and outfitters.`
	"CN-9046" `You're approached by a Heliarch delegation shortly after you leave your ship.`
	"CN-9047" `	"Cautiously observed during the past few weeks, scans of your ship have been, Captain <last>," the Saryd begins.`
	"CN-9048" `	"Unlike previous scans, a jump drive in your ship, our scanners found not," the Kimek continues.`
	"CN-9049" `	"Though appreciate the work you here perform, we do, for you to be cut-off from the galaxy, we wish not," the Arach says. "Discussed much, our consuls have, and to help you, they decided. To the <destination> you must go, there discussed, the terms will be."`
	"CN-9050" `	"By that you mean you'll get me another jump drive? That's pretty generous of you."`
	"CN-9051" `	"What? I lost my jump drive? You've gotta be kidding!"`
	"CN-9052" `	"Generous we are indeed. Lucky you are, that under our jurisdiction this happened. Were it the Quarg's, stranded you would remain," the Saryd responds.`
	"CN-9053" `	"A good thing that a watchful eye we keep, if noticed you had not," the Kimek says. "But even still, more careful with your outfits you should be."`
	"CN-9054" `	You thank them for bringing you this information, and go back to your ship to prepare a route to the <destination>.`
	"CN-9055" `The Heliarchs are waiting for you when you land. You see no civilians as you look around, but there are enough armed guards to man several of their Punishers. Said Punishers are all parked near your own ship.`
	"CN-9056" `	The Saryd starts speaking, "As to be trusted, you have been deemed, provide you with a jump drive, so that stranded you are not, we will."`
	"CN-9057" `	"Mind you, not a gift this is, but a loan, Captain," the Kimek continues. "Another one to replace this one, you must bring us, so that losing a copy of such valuable equipment, we are not."`
	"CN-9058" `	"By <date>, brought here the replacement jump drive must be. If any longer you take, assume that betrayed our trust you have, we will, and an enemy, considered you will be," the Arach finishes explaining. "Agree with those terms, do you, Captain?"`
	"CN-9059" `	"Yes, I promise I'll return with a second jump drive."`
	"CN-9060" `	"Sorry, I need more time to think on this."`
	"CN-9061" `	Their engineers proceed to install the jump drive in your ship. A couple of the guards come a bit closer during the process. When it's all done, you're reminded that you need to bring another jump drive here by <date>.`
	"CN-9062" `Some Coalition citizens, most of which are Arachi, start surrounding your ship after you land, talking among themselves while also glancing at a Heliarch Neutralizer that followed you as you prepared to land on <origin>. The Heliarch agents step off their ship and speak with an Arach of the civilian group. They head back inside their ship after a while and hail you: it seems they've noticed you're carrying samples of the exotic yottrite, and would like to know if you're willing to sell it to them.`
	"CN-9063" `	When you approach them, the Arach explains that he is one of the people that oversee the mining operations on <planet> and that he would like to bring the yottrite there so that they can attempt to study it with their most advanced equipment.`
	"CN-9064" `	"Few entries on yottrite, my predecessors managed to catalog," he says. "Naturally occur in our territory, it does not. Few opportunities to study it, we've had."`
	"CN-9065" `	After discussing with his colleagues for a bit, he announces that he is willing to pay you 350,000 credits for the mineral sample.`
	"CN-9066" `	"Sounds like a fair deal to me. Sold."`
	"CN-9067" `	"Sorry, but I think I'll hold on to it. It was very hard to get it in the first place."`
	"CN-9068" `	He thanks you and transfers the yottrite from your ship to his own, an Arach Spindle, with the help of some spaceport workers. Right before departing he hands you the credits and says that you should bring a few more samples to <destination>. "Three more, you should bring, if interested you are."`
	"CN-9069" `As you land on <origin>, you're contacted by the Arach you sold some yottrite to. He asks if you have any more samples to sell him.`
	"CN-9070" `	"Not right now, sorry."`
	"CN-9071" `	"I have some, yeah. Where should I bring them to?"`
	"CN-9072" `	He tells you to land as usual. Once your ship is brought to the underground area, some workers help unload the yottrite, and ask you to follow them into a restricted section of the complex to get your payment. The guards at the entrance watch closely as your group passes by.`
	"CN-9073" `	You walk along extremely wide industrial catwalks overlooking endless smelters and forges of various sizes. Though the heat of the place may be influencing your perception, you're almost certain the largest smelters must be around the size of a light warship.`
	"CN-9074" `	After walking for too long in the uncomfortably hot and stuffy interiors of the underground compound, you and the several tons of yottrite are finally brought to a large area similar to a warehouse. Several workers are operating machinery and making sure ore pieces are brought to specific conveyor belts.`
	"CN-9075" `	As the workers leave you to bring the yottrite to a separate section of the facility, you're greeted by the Arach who contacted you. "In your debt, we are, Captain <last>," he says, handing you 1,050,000 credits. "Much will be achieved, if significant progress with the samples we make."`
	"CN-9076" `	"What sort of progress?"`
	"CN-9077" `	"What are you hoping to achieve?"`
	"CN-9078" `	"Non-standard thermodynamic properties, yottrite has. Absorb heat around them, the crystals do. Difficult to mix it into a compound, it is," he explains. "If how to overcome this obstacle, we learn, many applications, the element could have."`
	"CN-9079" `	"Run several tests on the Quarg equipment, for centuries, our Coalition has. React similarly to yottrite, some of their equipment does. A material involved in the making of their outfits, it is," he explains. "If how to do such a thing ourselves, we learn, maybe replicate their technology, or resume construction of the ringworlds, we could."`
	"CN-9080" `	A worker by the yottrite crates shouts something, and the Arach signals he will be heading there shortly.`
	"CN-9081" `	"Once again, if any more yottrite, you acquire, bring it here, you may," he says before leaving. "Tirelessly researching it, we are. If in a larger batch, you could bring them, progress quicker, we might."`
	"CN-9082" `	He says that about seven samples of the mineral should do for next time and finally leaves. Some workers come shortly after to escort you back to your ship through the maze of smelters.`
	"CN-9083" `Once again, you arrive at <origin> with a supply of yottrite and are contacted by the Arachi here. They ask if you're ready to sell what samples you've brought them.`
	"CN-9084" `	"Maybe some other time."`
	"CN-9085" `	"Sure am. Have some people wait by the docking area to help me unload the samples."`
	"CN-9086" `	As the workers get the ore samples out of your ship, you realize that this time the Arach that asked for your help wasn't the one to contact you, nor was he waiting for you on the ground.`
	"CN-9087" `	The workers say they will bring the yottrite to the warehouse on their own, and you're told to wait. When they return, they're accompanied by other workers with different crates. They hand you 2,450,000 credits, and ask for permission to load the crates onto your ship.`
	"CN-9088" `	"Roughly 5 tons, they weigh. To <destination>, this planet's neighboring world, you must bring them. Requested it so, the overseer has," they say.`
	"CN-9089" `	"What's in the crates?"`
	"CN-9090" `	"That's gotta be the shortest courier mission I've ever heard of. Can't some other ship do the trip?"`
	"CN-9091" `	"Older samples that you've brought to us, they contain. Experimented with, the yottrite was. Unsure of the details, I am."`
	"CN-9092" `	"For you to carry them, the overseer asked. Why you in particular, unsure I am."`
	"CN-9093" `	You figure that since it's so little cargo and to a planet in this very system, there's no harm in delivering the crates. They place them in your ship.`
	"CN-9094" `Though on <origin> you weren't greeted by him, the same Arach from the other trips now contacts you as you prepare to land on <planet>.`
	"CN-9095" `	"Captain <last>! Forgive me for my absence in our latest deal, you must. Sort out some business here, I had to," he says.`
	"CN-9096" `	He directs you to land on a separate area of the planet, and halfway there little by little a Heliarch fleet starts tailing your ship. You spend a few minutes hovering over the area until they finally give you permission to land. Some of the ships land along with you while others remain in flight, as you come to a massive warehouse complex on a large valley. The facility is walled with some odd kind of barbed wire on top of the walls and fences, and several armed Heliarch agents are patrolling the area.`
	"CN-9097" `	As you leave your ship, the Arach is waiting for you alongside some Heliarch officers. They have the cargo removed from your ship without saying much.`
	"CN-9098" `	Right before the Heliarch ships prepare to escort you back to the standard docking area, he says, "In the spaceport, meet you I will."`
	"CN-9099" `You wait around the spaceport for some minutes before finally spotting the Arach. He invites you to his office.`
	"CN-9100" `	"Responsible for overseeing deliveries of such exotic materials to the warehouses here, I also am. For the inconvenience and bureaucracy, I apologize," he says. "Forget to properly introduce myself, I often do. Lugglop, I am called."`
	"CN-9101" `	"Nice to meet you, I suppose."`
	"CN-9102" `	"Do you need more samples? Is that why you called me here?"`
	"CN-9103" `	"Harder to keep track of them, it becomes, the more samples there are," he says. "Notified by the Heliarchs, I was. No more samples, for now, I can request. Risk letting them be stolen, they cannot." He then shows you a map of the Coalition, pointing to a system in Saryd space. "Use more delicate procedures and research, to study the samples we must. For that, friends of mine on <destination>, will be waiting," he says. "Bring them here, would you, Captain?"`
	"CN-9104" `	"Of course, they'll be here soon."`
	"CN-9105" `	"Sorry, I'm not one to take passenger jobs."`
	"CN-9106" `A Saryd wearing their version of a lab coat is waiting for you when you enter the spaceport.`
	"CN-9107" `	"Working with Lugglop, you are?" He asks, and you nod. "Nasilor, my name is. Packing up our belongings, my sister is. Bring you to our laboratory, I shall."`
	"CN-9108" `	You follow him deep into the underground spaceport to the "residential" section, which, to you, is indistinguishable from a research compound. The endless doors to your left and right occasionally give space for large glass panels, giving you a nice view of the massive crystal formations here.`
	"CN-9109" `	Nasilor stops by a door immediately after one of these "viewing sites" and opens it. He introduces you to his sister, Alituri, and you two start helping her pack what remains. Most of what they're bringing are several research papers, though you can't figure out what's written on them.`
	"CN-9110" `	Finally, you start heading back to your ship. Noticing your interest in the beauty of the gypsum caves, the two Saryd researchers slow down their pace and start to tell you more about themselves. They are twins, both born on Saros, but have been working here for decades. Though you don't understand much of the technical jargon, you figure out that Nasilor specializes in cryptocrystalline compounds, while Alituri focuses her studies on planetary and cosmic conditions that lead to the formation of the gypsum caves here.`
	"CN-9111" `	With the little "tour" over, when you three reach your ship, you show them to their bunks and prepare to head back to <planet>.`
	"CN-9112" `Lugglop is waiting for you when you land and greets the two researchers as you help them get their things out of the ship.`
	"CN-9113" `	He points them to a hotel where he had a room prepared for them, and asks you to follow him to his office again.`
	"CN-9114" `	"Filled to the brim with cutting edge equipment, our facilities here and on the neighbor planet are. Alas, venture much into the theoretical field needed to study such rare elements, our personnel here does not."`
	"CN-9115" `	He shows you to his map again, this time pointing to a nearby Arach world. "Once cracked some aspects of yottrite, the twins have, an expert in ship making, we will need," he says. "On <destination>, prepared one of their representatives, House Mallob has. Bring them here, you must."`
	"CN-9116" `	You're about to head back to your ship when he hands you 200,000 credits. "Nearly forgot to pay you for this last service, I did."`
	"CN-9117" `You're immediately hailed by House Mallob when your ship is entering the atmosphere of <origin>. They guide you through the planet, bringing you to what looks like a massive, castle-like structure, which appears to be made out of a similar material to that of Arach ships, sitting at the base of a mountain.`
	"CN-9118" `	You land on a large docking area, where some other ships are also conducting business. Stepping off of your ship you're greeted by what is unmistakably an outfitter, and as you look around you spot some other large buildings dotting the surrounding area, with members of the Coalition going to and from them. The atmosphere feels like that of a small village turned into an outdoor shopping mall.`
	"CN-9119" `	Shortly after landing you're greeted by an Arach wearing what you judge to be some sort of uniform. He takes a translation device out of his pocket and formally greets you. "Honored to have you as a guest, the great House Mallob is, Captain <first> <last>."`
	"CN-9120" `	"Are you the shipwright I'll be taking to Lugglop?"`
	"CN-9121" `	"What's with this place? Why are there so many buildings all over?"`
	"CN-9122" `	"Mountains, no! But a servant of House Mallob, I am. Mostly as a chauffeur, I work."`
	"CN-9123" `	"No mere mansion, the private property of House Mallob is," he says as he starts pointing to different areas. "A museum, there we have, detailing the history of Arach ships. To the left, a marketplace is. To the right, House Mallob's private university is, where study the advanced methods of ship making, honor students from all over the Coalition do."`
	"CN-9124" `	He then asks that you follow him, saying, "Assist Lugglop in his research, my mistress will. Meet her in the mansion, you must." You follow him along the path, and he gives a bit more detail on some of the buildings as you walk near them. What really piques your interest though is that one of the buildings, which he seemed to willingly ignore, had armed guards at the door, with no indication of being members of the Heliarch.`
	"CN-9125" `	Reaching the entrance of the mansion, it isn't as castle-like as the walls, but it all still looks strangely pompous. Up close it almost looks like all the several parts and pods of an Arach Hulk or two were crumpled together into one single building.`
	"CN-9126" `	He guides you through the mansion. You pass by several other servants, notice rooms where he mentions that members of House Mallob are having meetings, and even meet a group of Saryd and Kimek students who came here to study with the shipwrights of House Mallob.`
	"CN-9127" `	Finally, he brings you to a room on the third floor, claiming that your passenger is waiting inside. You enter, only to see a Kimek glancing out the window.`
	"CN-9128" `	"I take it that's the shipwright?"`
	"CN-9129" `	"So, is my passenger crawling around somewhere? In some corner hidden in a web?"`
	"CN-9130" `	"A Kimek? I thought this was an Arach House."`
	"CN-9131" `	The butler ignores what you said and introduces you to the Kimek in question. "Marry into House Mallob at a young age, miss Pichiie did. A former student at the university here, she was."`
	"CN-9132" `	"Correct you are, Captain," he says. "Proud to introduce you to miss Pichiie, I am. A former student at the university here, she was, before marry into House Mallob, she did."`
	"CN-9133" `	Finally, the reason why you had to come all the way to this part of <origin> becomes clear; Pichiie mentions she would like to hear your stories about where you got the yottrite in the first place before boarding your ship to head to <planet>. You tell her all samples you've come across were found in systems where the star had gone supernova. It's a short explanation, but she appears to be satisfied, and after saying her goodbyes to other members of the House, you're both brought to your ship.`
	"CN-9134" `As with the Saryd twins, Lugglop greets Pichiie and tells her of a hotel he prepared for her time here.`
	"CN-9135" `	"Ready, my team is now, Captain," he says, after Pichiie leaves with her luggage. "Enrich and research samples as needed, for the next few months we will. Contact you again, I will, should the need for your services arise once again."`
	"CN-9136" `	He hands you <payment>, and walks away.`
	"CN-9137" `When you land, you receive a message from Lugglop, the Arach to whom you brought several yottrite samples.`
	"CN-9138" `	"Captain, some major findings, we have. Preparing a presentation about our research, to present in Ring of Wisdom, we are," he says. "Only, run out of pure samples, we have. Bring us one once more, would you? Willing to pay slightly more for the inconvenience, we are. <payment>."`
	"CN-9139" `	"Okay, I'll bring you a piece of yottrite once again."`
	"CN-9140" `	"Sorry, but I'm not mining that any more."`
	"CN-9141" `	He thanks you and says he and the rest of the team will be waiting in <destination>. "Moved here about halfway through the project, we did, to make use of the station's facilities."`
	"CN-9142" `You meet Lugglop in the spaceport and follow him to meet with Nasilor, Alituri, and Pichiie, who are overseeing some workers place a few sealed metal crates inside a container and the yottrite sample you just brought here into another. They detail how they have prepared all the material they needed and now just need a transport to the <destination>.`
	"CN-9143" `	"If with us, you come, Captain, perhaps a better detailed description of the systems where the yottrite was found, you could provide," Nasilor says.`
	"CN-9144" `	"<payment>, I would pay you," Lugglop says.`
	"CN-9145" `	"Of course I'll take you there. Have the containers loaded into my ship."`
	"CN-9146" `	"What discoveries have you made about it?"`
	"CN-9147" `	"To share our findings with you, allowed we are not," Pichiie says.`
	"CN-9148" `	"Forgive us you must, Captain, but told to keep everything a secret, we were," Lugglop continues. "Perhaps after our presentation, public our findings could be made."`
	"CN-9149" `	They all follow you to your ship after the containers are ready to be loaded.`
	"CN-9150" `	After they are put into your cargo, Nasilor, Alituri and Pichiie head to their bunks, but as Lugglop is coming on board, you see that two Heliarch agents, both Kimek, are accompanying him. "Here to ensure the secrecy of our discoveries, they are," he says. Seeing as they are only two more passengers, you agree to carry them to <planet>, and they all board your ship.`
	"CN-9151" `Immediately when you land, Lugglop gives you your payment of <payment>. You and the four researchers then follow some Heliarch agents that were waiting for you at the docks. You five are brought to an area akin to a theater with some type of podium on the stage. The seats are all taken by Heliarch agents.`
	"CN-9152" `	Lugglop's team apparently will wait until the contents of the two containers are brought here, so you're asked to describe the systems with supernovae where you encountered yottrite asteroids. This only lasts a few minutes, as the audience doesn't seem too keen on inquiring about details, though one particular Saryd did puzzle you when they asked about the state of the supernovas you visited. You tell them you don't know what they mean, and they press the topic no further.`
	"CN-9153" `	After you finish, and right as the materials for Lugglop's presentation arrive, you're escorted back to your ship by some agents. Several hours later, you're contacted by Lugglop, who says the presentation is finished, and his group is coming back to your ship. When they arrive, they each thank you for providing the means to perform their experiments. "Officially commended for our efforts, we were!" he says.`
	"CN-9154" `	"Though allowed to publicly share our findings, we are not still, invited to be part of the team here that will continue the research, we were," Pichiie adds. The Saryd twins say they will reside here for as long as the project continues, while Pichiie comments on how she'll often be taking trips to visit her family in House Mallob's property.`
	"CN-9155" `	"As for me, a job as overseer, I still have to perform," Lugglop says. "Stay here for a few days I will, but even with all the advanced equipment of this ring, still our Coalition's most capable, the smelters of Bloptab's Furnace are. In their optimal state they must be, if to deepen our knowledge on yottrite, we are. Return there shortly, I will."`
	"CN-9156" `	They thank you again for all your help and wish you safe travels as you continue exploring.`
	"CN-9157" `At any given time there are thousands of Kimek here in the spaceport, either mingling among themselves during a break from work or negotiating travel prices with starship captains. You imagine that if you weren't a human and clearly stood out, you too would be constantly getting offers to travel to another world, as many civilian captains here wish to fill a last bunk or two they have vacant on their ship before departing.`
	"CN-9158" `	You manage to find a restaurant here where you spot some food you've already learned you can eat, so you take a seat and order something.`
	"CN-9159" `	You're halfway through your meal when you notice the waiter who brought it to you still hasn't moved away from the table.`
	"CN-9160" `	"Sorry, should I have paid first before eating?"`
	"CN-9161" `	The Kimek doesn't have a translation box, so your words don't reach him. While he insists on remaining by the table, you also notice he has been constantly glancing at the entrance, as if waiting for someone to come in.`
	"CN-9162" `	When a Heliarch agent passes by the entrance, the Kimek says something in his language, heading to meet the Heliarch, and speaking with them briefly. The Heliarch agent then accompanies the Kimek waiter to your table.`
	"CN-9163" `	"Does he need something?"`
	"CN-9164" `	"Did I do something wrong?"`
	"CN-9165" `	"Wish to speak to you, this Kimek does, Captain," the agent says, as they continue listening to what the Kimek is telling them, and makes an effort to translate their message to you. "Called Chikee, he is. A student, aspiring to join the ranks of the Heliarchs. Looking for transportation to <destination>, he is, so that a better job there he may acquire."`
	"CN-9166" `	"Sure, I'll take him there."`
	"CN-9167" `	"How much will he pay me?"`
	"CN-9168" `	"I'm not headed that way, sorry."`
	"CN-9169" `	The Heliarch asks the young Kimek about payment, to which he takes a pause before responding, and when he does so he speaks a lot slower than before.`
	"CN-9170" `	"Not enough funds to pay you for the trip, he has," the agent says. "However, to pay you once well established he is, he promises."`
	"CN-9171" `	"Okay then, I'll take him there."`
	"CN-9172" `	"I prefer not having to wait to get paid, sorry."`
	"CN-9173" `	You're told to wait for Chikee before departing the planet, and the Heliarch agent leaves. You leave the restaurant yourself shortly after, and head to your ship.`
	"CN-9174" `	The Kimek is a bit surprised by you having a translation box, but seems to be put at ease knowing that he can speak with you directly now.`
	"CN-9175" `	"Chikee, my name is, Captain. A student. Looking for transportation to <destination>, I am," he blabs, scrambling to show you what you assume is some kind of letter. "A job in the mines there, I was offered. Better payment than this one, it has."`
	"CN-9176" `	"Sure, I'll take you there."`
	"CN-9177" `	He pauses for a bit, and you see his mandibles clicking together time and again.`
	"CN-9178" `	"Lacking proper funds, I currently am," he says, speaking much slower than before. "Once paid by this new job I am, however, pay you I will. I promise."`
	"CN-9179" `	"Ok, I'll take you there."`
	"CN-9180" `	I prefer not having to wait to get paid, sorry.`
	"CN-9181" `	He thanks you and says to wait for him by your ship before you depart. You leave the restaurant shortly after, and head to your ship.`
	"CN-9182" `	Night falls, but there hasn't been any decrease to the activities here, as the hordes of captains and workers still populate the docking area and the spaceport.`
	"CN-9183" `	Around midnight, Chikee arrives at your ship, and you show him to his bunk. He is only bringing a single, old rugged bag with him.`
	"CN-9184" `While strolling through the spaceport, you're flagged down by a familiar face. It's Chikee, the Kimek student whom you brought here months ago.`
	"CN-9185" `	He excitedly greets you and talks about how well his studies have been going. You notice that he now has a translation device of his own, positioned by his neck.`
	"CN-9186" `	"Purchased it recently, I did, so that hindered by language barriers, I am not," he says. "Excellent timing you have, Captain. Looking for transportation, once again I am."`
	"CN-9187" `	He tells you how his academic successes have earned him an internship in one of the laboratories on <destination>, and that he needs someone to transport him there by <date> so that he may begin working right away.`
	"CN-9188" `	"Better, the payment is, but also hoping for a recommendation letter, I am," he says, explaining that such letters from a Heliarch laboratory could help him significantly in joining their ranks.`
	"CN-9189" `	"Sounds like you've worked pretty hard for this. Let's go to my ship, I'll take you there."`
	"CN-9190" `	"You still haven't paid me for last time, though."`
	"CN-9191" `	He freezes up for a bit, not responding.`
	"CN-9192" `	"Just enough money to rent an apartment there, I have. Save up until the laboratory pays me, I must," he says. "Scamming you, I am not, Captain. Thankful I am, and pay you handsomely, I will."`
	"CN-9193" `	"Alright, I'll wait again. Let's go to my ship."`
	"CN-9194" `	"Sorry, but I'm not one to be fooled twice."`
	"CN-9195" `	He thanks you, and this time follows you right away, as he already has his bags prepared.`
	"CN-9196" `	"Hoping to join the research teams on Ring of Wisdom, I am," he says as you two walk to your ship, explaining the reason he needs to study so much is because he is aiming to work for the scientific branch of the government, instead of the more military-focused side.`
	"CN-9197" `	You lead him to his bunk and prepare for the trip.`
	"CN-9198" `It seems the laboratory Chikee will work in is quite far away from the docking area, so after bidding you farewell, he decides to walk there immediately to get acquainted with his new bosses as soon as possible.`
	"CN-9199" `	As he starts crossing one of the bridges linking the canyon walls here, he visibly struggles against the strong winds, as his bags seem to weigh him down.`
	"CN-9200" `	(Help him with his bags.)`
	"CN-9201" `	(Let him go on his own.)`
	"CN-9202" `	You catch up to him without too much trouble, though you too are also somewhat troubled by the winds here. You pick up one of his bags, and he becomes much more comfortable with facing the constant blasts of air, though he still walks slower than the expected from a Kimek.`
	"CN-9203" `	The two of you walk for about twenty minutes before finally reaching the laboratory. It is shielded by several large thick walls of stone slabs, much like many buildings in this unorthodox city.`
	"CN-9204" `	You wish Chikee the best of luck and head back to your ship.`
	"CN-9205" `As you land on <origin>, you notice that 170,000 credits have been transferred to your account, along with a message.`
	"CN-9206" `	It's from Chikee, the Kimek student whom you brought here. He asks that you meet him in an area here more well protected from the winds, so you head there.`
	"CN-9207" `	Upon meeting him, he says in a jolly tone, "Kept my promise, I did, Captain. Paid you, I have."`
	"CN-9208" `	His internship here apparently went really well, and he got the recommendation letter he wanted and is once again looking for transportation.`
	"CN-9209" `	"Passing by a month ago, some members of House Idriss were. The Arach House that deals with the construction of hardware, they are," he says. "Interested by my work, they were. Offered a partnership on <destination>, they have."`
	"CN-9210" `	"I thought you wanted to become a Heliarch. How exactly will all of this help you?"`
	"CN-9211" `	"Hold on, what sort of 'work' were they interested by? What have you been working on?"`
	"CN-9212" `	"If well known among the scientific community, I become, more merit, my curriculum will have," he says. "Make it easier to pass the trials, all the knowledge and experience I've gathered until now will as well."`
	"CN-9213" `	"Larger than most, the Kimek population is. Struggle to properly distribute medication or other chemicals, even worlds richer than my homeworld do," he says. "Seeking to create an independent network to provide better distribution, I am."`
	"CN-9214" `	He jokes about how it's silly that although his species has such incredible advancements in their alimentary transport network, it's still difficult for most of the population to find medicine for what is translated as "the common cold" by the device. He claims that, were he on the Heliarch council, he could directly propose changes and solutions to such problems.`
	"CN-9215" `	He tells you a bit more about his work here, how it was working with Saryds, and the cultural exchange. Though he seems to have garnered some fond memories of his time here, you notice while heading for your ship that he still hasn't gotten used to the wind.`
	"CN-9216" `	You show him to his bunk and prepare for the journey to <destination>.`
	"CN-9217" `You're contacted by Chikee when you land.`
	"CN-9218" `	"Captain <last>! Good news and another job for you, I have," he says, asking that you meet him in the spaceport.`
	"CN-9219" `	You head there, and he's already with his bags, prepared to board your ship. "Helped me a lot, House Idriss has. An audience with the Heliarch, on the <destination> I have!"`
	"CN-9220" `	He tells you that he needs to be there by <date>, and wastes no time as he heads into your ship.`
	"CN-9221" `Chikee hands you <payment> before leaving your ship. Heliarch agents are waiting for him, and receive him in a bit of a ceremony.`
	"CN-9222" `	You spend a few hours browsing some shops here and have some food once you find an establishment that serves something appetizing to humans.`
	"CN-9223" `	Ringworlds have no day or night, but looking at your ship's internal clock, it is almost night time when Chikee returns to your ship in a hurry.`
	"CN-9224" `	"Accepted I was! Grant me the rank, they did!" he says, showing you a Heliarch circlet as he puts it on his head. "Infinitely grateful for your help in all of this I am, Captain."`
	"CN-9225" `	You congratulate him on the achievement, and he starts to tell you how what he calls the "trial" went. Aside from explaining his work on places that got him a recommendation letter, he was told to do a presentation on his own work to some type of jury and pass an interview. "Wait in a line with other candidates, I had to. To be selected, only a few were. So nervous, I was," he says. After thanking you again and trying to shake hands with you, he leaves your ship one last time, and you wish him the best of luck in his new line of work.`
	"CN-9226" `As you enter the spaceport, you notice several battalions of Coalition doctors roaming about, talking with merchant captains and then following some of them back to their ships.`
	"CN-9227" `	One such crowd approaches you, and a Saryd among them says, "Broken out on <destination>, a deadly virus has. Captains willing to transport us and <cargo>, we seek." She shows you to the group of doctors, <bunks> of them.`
	"CN-9228" `	"I'd be glad to help with something serious like that. Let's go to my ship."`
	"CN-9229" `	"I can't afford to fill so many bunks right now, sorry."`
	"CN-9230" `	The doctors rush inside your ship, and spaceport workers quickly place the <cargo> in your cargo hold.`
	"CN-9231" `	When you get the chance, you ask them what exactly the virus is, and they explain as best as they can how it causes "tumorous-like behavior on Kimek exoskeletons, rapidly degenerating the tissue and exposing the flesh, all the while increasing the risk of infection." They say that although it is most dangerous to Kimek, there are confirmed cases of some Arachi having contracted the disease.`
	"CN-9232" `	It seems pretty serious, so you should make sure these doctors and their supplies are brought to <destination> as quickly as possible.`
	"CN-9233" `As before, the spaceport is completely dominated by doctors and nurses. You don't find the person who told you to come here, but as you ask one of the other emergency workers, they direct you to a makeshift office set up next to a few trading panels.`
	"CN-9234" `	"Fairly new to us, this virus is," the Kimek manning the stand says. "But finally developed an initial batch of vaccines for it, the researchers on Secret Sky thankfully have."`
	"CN-9235" `	"What do you mean 'finally?' Didn't this virus just break out recently?"`
	"CN-9236" `	"You want me to go there retrieve the vaccines?"`
	"CN-9237" `	He looks puzzled by your question.`
	"CN-9238" `	"That some weeks have already passed, true it is, but hard at work, the researchers have been," he says. "Blame them for taking a few days more than usual, we cannot. Intricate, this virus is."`
	"CN-9239" `	He shows you a detailed map of Kimek space, explaining that most of the confirmed and suspected cases have been there. Given that the Kimek population is more than double that of the Arachi and the Saryds combined, it's not surprising.`
	"CN-9240" `	"To <destination>, this initial batch must be brought. From there, distributing more batches of the vaccines to other worlds, you will be tasked with."`
	"CN-9241" `	As the line of volunteering merchant captains continues to grow behind you, he is swift to inform you that payment will be <payment>, and asks that the next person come forward.`
	"CN-9242" `An incessant stream of freighters has the landing pads of the spaceport here overcrowded, and from the looks of it you were only given a quick clearance due to carrying the vaccines.`
	"CN-9243" `	The people here, who are surprisingly managing to keep the place organized despite the overwhelming traffic, pay you <payment> as they unload the vaccines from your cargo hold.`
	"CN-9244" `	"Waiting in the spaceport with more tasks for you, our colleagues will be, Captain <last>," one says before running off to tend to other ships carrying doctors or supplies.`
	"CN-9245" `This time you're expected and are brought to a large conference room where many Saryds, and the occasional Arach, are waiting. A Kimek that is part of the team organizing the containment procedures comes in and says you will once again be transporting vaccines.`
	"CN-9246" `	"In a few hours, fully replicated, the vaccine samples will be. Load them onto your ships, we will. Deliver them to <stopovers>, you must."`
	"CN-9247" `	Everyone is then separated into groups. You're put with two Saryd captains and an Arach who is wearing some protective suit of sorts that covers his entire body, making it somewhat difficult for him to walk.`
	"CN-9248" `	The captains agree to follow your lead and deliver the vaccines along with you, so you all head back to your ships.`
	"CN-9249" `You and the other captains are told to wait in one of several lines formed here. Your group chats with some others while you wait, and a few mention how their batch of vaccines was delivered to Arach and Saryd space. Apparently many tourists had contracted the disease before flying to those areas.`
	"CN-9250" `	The line moves quickly, and once it's your turn, you're paid <payment>, and then swiftly shoved along by the workers who are already paying the person who was behind you.`
	"CN-9251" `	Looking back at the line, and seeing the sheer number of captains waiting for their share, it's no wonder the Kimek that paid you were extremely brief. As you come back to your ship, you see that a message was sent to you by the Coalition government. More specifically, it appears to have been sent by their Department of Health.`
	"CN-9252" `	"To all captains who helped in dealing with the recent viral outbreak, you have our gratitude and may rest tonight knowing you've contributed to the continued prosperity of our Coalition."`
	"CN-9253" `A Kimek in a lab coat is desperately running around the spaceport here, carrying a small package with some papers attached.`
	"CN-9254" `	As soon as she spots you, she quickly approaches you and says, "Human! The visitor I've heard about, you are! From the outside! A jump drive you have, if our space you've reached, yes?"`
	"CN-9255" `	You nod, and she continues, "Live on <planet>, a Saryd friend of mine does. Forgotten that his birthday was on <date>, I had! Make it in time for the party, I cannot. Busy with work, I am. At least send his present, I'd like to, but make it in time, regular ships here can't! With your jump drive, get there in a day you could. Help me, would you, Captain?"`
	"CN-9256" `	"Just that small package? Easy enough, I'll do it."`
	"CN-9257" `	"I'm not headed there, sorry, have another mission to do. Somewhere else."`
	"CN-9258" `Apparently the Saryd in question doesn't live here in the spaceport village, so you must take a train to go to his home. Thankfully, a train ticket was attached to the package, so you waste no time and get on the next train there.`
	"CN-9259" `	Even for a world without too large a population, the train wagons here feel unusually empty, with only a handful of other passengers on the one you settle in. The trip takes a few hours, so you have plenty of time to look out the window and gaze at the sights of the seemingly infinite winter forest.`
	"CN-9260" `	Halfway through, a blizzard makes it tough to see much outside. The ticket inspectors come through again, now serving a creamy blue drink which seems to be their equivalent of hot chocolate.`
	"CN-9261" `	Once you arrive at the village, you follow the makeshift map of the streets the Kimek included and deliver the present to her Saryd friend. Apparently the party had just started.`
	"CN-9262" `	When you get back to your ship, <payment> are transferred to your account, and you get a short message from the Kimek researcher, thanking you for helping out.`
	"CN-9263" `While walking by some shops, a young Saryd bumps into you as you're turning a corner, knocking you to the ground. He helps you up, apologizing. A couple others that were with him entered a shop without even noticing you, but almost immediately come back out.`
	"CN-9264" `	They speak with him, pointing at the shop and to where they must have been before bumping into you, while their friend tinkers with a translation box.`
	"CN-9265" `	"No luck?" he asks them, tinkering with a translation box, not realizing you have your own.`
	"CN-9266" `	His colleagues shake their heads, "Told the same as in the other store, we were. Shipping here, the Arachi no longer are," they say, pointing to the shop and to where they must have been before bumping into you. Their friend continues messing with the device.`
	"CN-9267" `	Once he's done, he asks, "Human, a merchant captain you are, correct? Looking for work, are you?"`
	"CN-9268" `	"What kind of work?"`
	"CN-9269" `	"Oh no, I live here actually. In the humantown district, right around the corner."`
	"CN-9270" `	"Actually I'm just here for the view, sorry."`
	"CN-9271" `	They all start laughing, some clearly finding your joke much funnier than you anticipated. Given the way they are stumbling on flat ground and the scent of alcohol that's permeated the air ever since one of them bumped into you, you realize why.`
	"CN-9272" `	"Fair enough. Not a common sight here, humans are, Captain," the one with a translation box says. "Asking for such a response, I was."`
	"CN-9273" `	They tell you that they are students at Starlit University and will be graduating soon. They intend on throwing a party to celebrate and had the idea of buying some traditional Arach rum for that.`
	"CN-9274" `	"Stopped shipping it here, the Arachi have," another Saryd says, pulling on the translation box on his friend's neck and nearly yanking it off. "Happened with many other drinks, this also has."`
	"CN-9275" `	They explain that the rum is produced on <destination>, and that you'll probably have an easier time finding it there. Despite you not knowing for sure how many people they intend on inviting to this party, and the fact that you don't know how much a Saryd can drink, you still worry a bit when they say that "two tons should do." They also tell you that to make it in time for the party, the rum should be bought by <date>.`
	"CN-9276" `	"Sounds good, I'll go get it and bring it to you."`
	"CN-9277" `	"How much would I need to pay for two tons?"`
	"CN-9278" `	"Sorry, but I'm against smuggling alcohol to students."`
	"CN-9279" `	"One of the pricier drinks, this rum is," the Saryd explains. "Some thousands of credits per ton, you should expect to pay. But well compensated, you will be."`
	"CN-9280" `You ask around and are directed to a large refinery on one of the more populated cities here. Apparently it's the original building where the Arach rum was first produced.`
	"CN-9281" `	You ask for two tons, avoiding giving the exact details of what it's for, as you do not wish to be held accountable for whatever some drunken Saryds may do, and pay the price for all the rum: 11,284 credits.`
	"CN-9282" `	The Arachi that take care to load the rum into your ship give you some odd looks, and when it's all done the manager tells you to try and slow down on the drinking.`
	"CN-9283" `Besides the students who tasked you with buying the rum, about a dozen others are waiting for your ship when you land and help you unload the beverages.`
	"CN-9284" `	"Saved our party you have, Captain," the Saryd with the translation device says, handing you <payment>.`
	"CN-9285" `	They head off, excitedly dragging along the cargo carts with the many kegs on top. Some of them have already taken the liberty of opening a keg and begun drinking.`
	"CN-9286" `Over a dozen Saryds walk up to you as you're entering the spaceport. They explain that they are census workers, and are in need of a transport to <destination>. "Left us hanging, our previous transport has."`
	"CN-9287" `	"What sort of data are you gathering? Just general information?"`
	"CN-9288" `	"Sure, I'll show you to your bunks."`
	"CN-9289" `	"You're not in luck then, I'm also not looking for any transport missions now."`
	"CN-9290" `	"Collecting data on population growth, we are. Agreed to help our colleagues, many other ships already have," one of them says.`
	"CN-9291" `	"Alright, I'll show you to your bunks."`
	"CN-9292" `	"Well I'm sure you can find someone else then. I'm not looking for any transport missions now."`
	"CN-9293" `	They thank you and start following you to your ship. There are <bunks> of them in total, now that you've had the time to count.`
	"CN-9294" `	You ask if this search will stick to Saryd space, and they say that each species usually sticks to their own home territory when gathering this type of data, so you shouldn't worry about having to take them from one end of Coalition space to the other.`
	"CN-9295" `	They settle in their bunks, and prepare for the trip.`
	"CN-9296" `Apparently you got lucky to have transported a group that was assigned to an area close to the spaceport city, as you see many other Coalition captains impatiently waiting for their own passengers to return, some looking at maps of the planet and grumbling.`
	"CN-9297" `	Most of the Saryds are here, but three of them still haven't come back, so the 14 that have already arrived just keep discussing the results they've found.`
	"CN-9298" `	(Go browse some shops, then come back later.)`
	"CN-9299" `	(Ask them about the data they have collected.)`
	"CN-9300" `	They explain how this census was mostly focused on the total population growth of the Coalition and how things are going as expected.`
	"CN-9301" `	"Remained stable, the Saryd population has," one of them comments. "At about 30 billion individuals, our numbers still are, though slightly increasing the fertility rate has been."`
	"CN-9302" `	As you continue to chat, one of them gets curious and asks you about humanity's population, to which you respond that your species numbers about 100 billion people.`
	"CN-9303" `	"Double that of the Arachi," one of the workers says.`
	"CN-9304" `	"And half that of the Kimek," another one completes.`
	"CN-9305" `	They ask you some more questions about human territory, but avoid getting too technical to the point where it's difficult for you to respond.`
	"CN-9306" `	You try and entertain yourself by looking at the shops here, but pretty much all of them are just filled with the produce of local farms.`
	"CN-9307" `	One of them has a few toys made out of straw. You take a look at the Saryd designs for them. They're nothing particularly special, nor as stereotypical as one might have expected from a species that resembles centaurs. Most of them appear to be replicating creatures of the local fauna or buildings like small houses.`
	"CN-9308" `	You notice two other census workers have come back, so you decide to return to the group and wait for the final member. Some Coalition captains from earlier have gathered together in a bar to lament the long wait.`
	"CN-9309" `	After the final Saryd arrives, you all head back to your ship, and you're told that the next destination is <destination>.`
	"CN-9310" `This time the workers mention how they were tasked with gathering data on a part of the planet other than the surroundings of the spaceport, as they pay you <payment>.`
	"CN-9311" `	Thankfully, they mention how the census is nearly over and that this was their final destination, so you won't need to wait for hours in the spaceport like the captains you saw on <origin>.`
	"CN-9312" `	They thank you for helping them do their job, and wish you safe travels.`
	"CN-9313" `While walking around the spaceport, you notice one of the Saryd workers that was refueling your ship is quickly galloping somewhere, only without his uniform, as if his shift just ended. He meets up with another Saryd and starts looking at a map with her.`
	"CN-9314" `	(Go back to my ship and check if it was properly refueled.)`
	"CN-9315" `	They pause their map-gazing and introduce themselves as Inturi and Aunaris, a young couple who are looking to move out of <origin> and build a home they've always dreamed of on another world.`
	"CN-9316" `	"Only, in need of money for that we are," Inturi says. "Worked in a ship as a crew member, I did, before decided to stay here and work on ship repairs and maintenance, I had."`
	"CN-9317" `	"Much too far away, his old job took him, and well paid, crew members are not," Aunaris says, bringing up the map again and showing it to you. "Offered a job in Starlit University, on <destination>, I was. Not too distant from <origin>, it is, and a higher pay, it offers. Transport me there, would you, Captain? Once ready our house is, pay you we would."`
	"CN-9318" `	"Of course, just come to my ship when you've finished preparing your luggage."`
	"CN-9319" `	"Sorry, I'm headed elsewhere now."`
	"CN-9320" `	They both thank you, and you head back to your ship.`
	"CN-9321" `	By nightfall, Aunaris arrives, accompanied by Inturi and some other Saryds, who you guess must be family members, as they all say their goodbyes. Once she enters your ship, you show her to her bunk, and prepare to leave.`
	"CN-9322" `	When you get to your ship, you check the control panel and do a short check-up. The fuel tank has been filled, and everything else is working properly. You leave your ship again, and move on with your business.`
	"CN-9323" `You're met with two familiar faces in the spaceport: the Saryd couple you met some time ago, Inturi and Aunaris, who were working on acquiring the funding needed to build their own home.`
	"CN-9324" `	"Worked for a week in another ship, I did, until landed here we had," Inturi says, joking about his way of catching a ride on a ship without paying a transport fee.`
	"CN-9325" `	"Sleeping well, I have not been, but helped much with the campus administration, I have. A bonus, I was given," Aunaris tells you.`
	"CN-9326" `	They say they just need a transport to <destination>, the world they have chosen to put down roots on, and after everything is done, they will work on getting you your payment.`
	"CN-9327" `	"Glad to hear it all worked out. Let's go to my ship, and I'll set a route to <planet>."`
	"CN-9328" `	"Sorry, but I'm not going there right now."`
	"CN-9329" `	You show them to their bunks, and prepare for the trip.`
	"CN-9330" `The couple leaves your ship and heads to a real estate agency. From what they told you during the trip, they have about two and a half million credits they can spend, which they claim is in line with the standard properties in the most valued (and most sought-after) locations here, and that they should still have enough money to pay you afterwards.`
	"CN-9331" `	They return from consulting, the both of them with disappointed looks on their faces. Inturi starts looking at the ships landing and departing while Aunaris comes talk to you.`
	"CN-9332" `	"Kept watch of one property, for months we had. On a mountain village, overlooking a lake, and with access to a nearby forest, it is. A few days ago, purchased it was," she sighs. "Available, another plot of land neighboring it is, but over half our funds, the land alone costs."`
	"CN-9333" `	Inturi then looks over, as if he had just received a shock, and says, "That's it! A ship! Live in a ship, we could!"`
	"CN-9334" `	"I like the enthusiasm, but unfortunately I'm not looking for any more crew members right now."`
	"CN-9335" `	"If you say so. Just don't forget the oranges, scurvy probably is a problem for Saryds too."`
	"CN-9336" `	"Live in a ship?" Aunaris repeats the sentence, puzzled.`
	"CN-9337" `	"In an Arach ship, for that week I worked. Taught me some things, the captain did. Often repurposed into houses, their ships are," he explains. "Their smallest ship, we could buy. Save time and money otherwise spent building a home, it would."`
	"CN-9338" `	They talk for a bit in private, and after a few minutes Inturi apparently managed to fully explain his idea and convince her.`
	"CN-9339" `	They head back to the real estate agency and arrange the purchase of the plot of land. Inturi then asks that you transport him to <destination>, where the basic Arach ship model is sold, and after buying it he will return here with the new "house."`
	"CN-9340" `	Aunaris will remain here to finish sorting out all the paperwork and will be waiting by the property once you two return.`
	"CN-9341" `Inturi heads right to the shipyard, and you help him with the purchase itself. He says that although he has worked in many ships over the years, he never went to the shipyard for more than picking up some parts for repair, or to polish a newly produced model.`
	"CN-9342" `	Only when you're with him inside the Arach vessel do you think of asking if he even knows how to fly a ship, but he reassures you that it won't be a problem.`
	"CN-9343" `	"To work as a copilot for an old friend, my first job was. Worry about me crashing the ship, you need not," he jokes.`
	"CN-9344" `	He says he will wait for your lead and follow you to <destination> once you depart.`
	"CN-9345" `You help Inturi park the ship on the plot of land, but since the Arach Courier takes up almost the entire area, your own ship has to land on a regular landing pad.`
	"CN-9346" `	After taking a transport up the mountain, you see that some workers are already there and are starting to remove ship components that won't be needed, like its engines and hyperdrive. A house doesn't need to be able to traverse the void of space, after all.`
	"CN-9347" `	The couple comes to meet up with you. "In a day or two, after some shopping we do, fully furnished the house will be," Aunaris says, looking at the ship.`
	"CN-9348" `	"Helped us a lot in getting it all sorted out you have, Captain <last>. Focus on working hard to pay you back in full, we will," Inturi adds.`
	"CN-9349" `	"You don't need to worry about paying me, I helped because I wanted to, not for a payday."`
	"CN-9350" `	"Well, I hope everything goes well. Best of luck to you two!"`
	"CN-9351" `	They look at you confused and then try to insist on paying you, but after some minutes they agree. "Too kind a heart you are, Captain," Aunaris says.`
	"CN-9352" `	They thank you again, and you head back to your ship.`
	"CN-9353" `When you land, you're notified of <payment> being transferred to your account.`
	"CN-9354" `	With it, there's a message. It's from Inturi and Aunaris, the Saryd couple who you helped move out to their very own home.`
	"CN-9355" `	In the message, they apologize for taking so long to pay you, and go on to tell you about how they've been doing there. Aunaris has been working in a school there, while Inturi has been helping other residents set up their own "ship-houses," as he calls them. Apparently it's become somewhat popular there after people saw the couple's home.`
	"CN-9356" `	They thank you again and say you're welcome to visit anytime.`
	"CN-9357" `When you land, you see you've received a message. It's from Inturi and Aunaris, the Saryd couple who you helped move out to their very own home.`
	"CN-9358" `	Along with the message, they've sent a picture of them both tending to some flowers and short trees in a little garden they've started up near the ship. In the message they go on to tell you about how they've been doing there. Aunaris has been working in a school there, while Inturi has been helping other residents set up their own "ship-houses," as he calls them. Apparently it's become somewhat popular there after people saw the couple's home.`
	"CN-9359" `You see some Arachi talking among themselves in the spaceport, occasionally glancing at and pointing at you.`
	"CN-9360" `	One of them finally comes to you and says, "Greetings, Captain. Interested in performing a cargo mission for us, are you?"`
	"CN-9361" `	She tells you that they are a cooperative of Arach ranchers, explains that the safety and health regulations for their business, longcow ranching, were recently updated, and that they need someone to pick up the newest antibiotics for the cattle on <stopovers>.`
	"CN-9362" `	"A jump drive you have, so get them faster - and allow us to resume business faster - you would."`
	"CN-9363" `	"You've found the perfect person for the job. I'm in."`
	"CN-9364" `	"I suppose that's true, but I'm not looking for courier jobs, sorry."`
	"CN-9365" `	The other Arachi come over to thank you after she signals to them that you've accepted to help. They explain that after you've picked up the antibiotics on <stopovers>, you'll have to drop them off on <planet> before wishing you a good trip.`
	"CN-9366" `You're paid 421,000 credits when you land, but as you help the ranchers unload the antibiotics, they say that something is off.`
	"CN-9367" `	"Only 6 tons of antibiotics, we requested," one of them says. "That extra ton surplus, ours is not."`
	"CN-9368" `	She goes away for about ten minutes to contact the lab workers back on New Finding. When she comes back, she seemingly jokes with the other ranchers in the Arach language, before talking to you.`
	"CN-9369" `	"Mixed up the cargo, they have. His own longcow ranch on <destination>, a cousin of mine has," she says. "Sent along with my own, his batch of antibiotics was."`
	"CN-9370" `	They contact the cousin in question and he asks that you transport his own part of the antibiotics to <destination>, where he will pay you <payment>.`
	"CN-9371" `An elderly Arach beckons to you as you enter the spaceport. He is accompanied by four Arach children, who all stand close to a large pile of luggage.`
	"CN-9372" `	He explains that he used to run an orphanage here, but has now gotten too old for the job. He has arranged for the four kids to be transferred to a foster home on <destination>.`
	"CN-9373" `	"Take care of them, the Saryds there will," he says, patting the head of the youngest and shortest of the kids. "Retiring, I am, but abandon them, I will not. An apartment close to the foster home, I will purchase."`
	"CN-9374" `	He offers to pay you <payment> to bring the five of them and their <cargo> to <destination>.`
	"CN-9375" `	"Of course I'll help. Here, let me help you get the luggage into my ship."`
	"CN-9376" `	"I hope things work out for you, but I'm actually not going to stay in or fly around Coalition space for long now."`
	"CN-9377" `You help the old Arach caretaker and some workers take the luggage out of your ship then head to the orphanage.`
	"CN-9378" `	A Saryd couple runs the place and greets you and the old Arach when you get there. Aside from a few Saryd kids, you notice the place already has an Arach child and some Kimek too.`
	"CN-9379" `	After you make sure all their belongings are inside the foster house, the Arach children head on inside to get acquainted with their new family. Their caretaker thanks you and hands you <payment> before heading inside himself.`
	"CN-9380" `As you're moving along one of the larger underground tunnels that connect the spaceport here, a dozen makeshift stands, each with a different apparent 'theme' to them, captures your attention. When you get closer, it's clear that the event is something of a convention, each stand managed by a different artist that lives here.`
	"CN-9381" `	After you're done looking at a stand that showcased various fantasy attires and move on to the neighboring one, its owner jumps as soon as he turns to see you, looking dumbfounded. He introduces himself as Drugub, a cartoonist of local fame for his science fiction comics, showing various examples of them as he speaks with you. "Many styles of ships produced in our space are, but only so many ideas from them, I can get," he says. "That you came here, lucky I am. To expand my creative horizon, I need, and seeing the general shape of some human ships would."`
	"CN-9382" `	"I can help with that. Do you have any type of ship in mind?"`
	"CN-9383" `	"Sorry, I'm just passing by, not looking for a job or anything."`
	"CN-9384" `	He looks puzzled. "For a variety of purposes, ships in my comics are used, so to know of a variety of ships, preferable it would be."`
	"CN-9385" `	You decide to give him a brief description of the biggest shipyards in human space, citing their history and design philosophy, from Syndicated Shipyards' cheaper designs to Deep Sky's sophisticated (by human standards) technology.`
	"CN-9386" `	When you're done, he thinks for a bit, then concludes that Betelgeuse Shipyards' older, historical designs, are what he's looking for. "Set during a less developed time, what I'm working on is," he explains.`
	"CN-9387" `	"In that case, I'll head to their home shipyard and see what I can bring back for you."`
	"CN-9388" `	"Alright, it's a bit of a long trip to <planet>, but if you're sure, let's head to my ship and I'll show you your bunk."`
	"CN-9389" `	"I happen to own a ship matching that description, a Betelgeuse Leviathan. Would you like to see it?"`
	"CN-9390" `	"Oh, leave I cannot. Whether far away or not this <planet> you speak of is, allowed to leave Coalition space, we are not," he says. "Go on without me you must, Captain."`
	"CN-9391" `	He thanks you and wishes you safe travels on your journey to <planet>.`
	"CN-9392" `	Though reading emotions from a giant spider proves challenging, Drugub appears to be star-struck.`
	"CN-9393" `	"Own a ship, a 'Leviathan,' you do? To your hangar, we must go!"`
	"CN-9394" `	After a brief walk to the hangar where your ship is parked, Drugub immediately begins crawling over the Leviathan. It seems what you've provided him with is far more substantial than any secondhand reference could possibly convey. He spends a while examining the ship up close before hopping down and taking many pictures from every conceivable angle -- as well as drawing a few quick sketches.`
	"CN-9395" `	Once he's finished, he hands you a payment of <payment> and spends some more time with you, asking you all the questions he can think of about the ship.`
	"CN-9396" `	"Very beautiful, this 'Leviathan' is. Thinking of many ways to draw it, I already am," he says. "Maybe a flagship of one of my characters, make it I will..."`
	"CN-9397" `	He spends some more minutes listening to you after he asks that you describe how your ship performs, thanks you again, and prepares to leave.`
	"CN-9398" `	"Oh, before I go, Captain <last>, use the name of your own ship for that 'Leviathan,' may I? Just as a small thank you."`
	"CN-9399" `	"Of course! It's called <ship>."`
	"CN-9400" `	"The name is nothing special. I wouldn't even get the reference of it if I read your comic in the future, honestly."`
	"CN-9401" `	"<ship> it is! Do it justice I will, Captain. Thanks again."`
	"CN-9402" `	"Ah, I see. Well, just a reference it would be, so the name matters not, I suppose. Anyway, thanks again, Captain."`
	"CN-9403" `When you ask the shipyard clerk if you could have something that detailed their ship models to "show a friend who is new to spaceships," she hands you a flyer. Inside, all of Betelgeuse's ships are depicted with some details on each (along with the pricing, of course).`
	"CN-9404" `	"Usually we show these to first time buyers, but you can take one if you want. Is your friend interested in buying? Maybe I could help you figure out what ship would best suit them."`
	"CN-9405" `	You thank her, saying that your friend does not have the funds for any of the ships and just wants some info, then head back to your ship.`
	"CN-9406" `	Hopefully a small pamphlet will do for Drugub to get some ideas.`
	"CN-9407" `Drugub is excitedly waiting for you when you return. However simple a piece of paper it may seem to you, he grabs the flyer as if it's some scroll of knowledge.`
	"CN-9408" `	He hands you your payment of <payment> and spends some time with you still, asking you all the questions he can think of about each ship.`
	"CN-9409" `	He spends some more minutes listening to you after he asks that you describe how you've seen each of the ships perform, thanks you again, and prepares to leave.`
	"CN-9410" `	"Ah, I see. Well, just a reference it would be, so the name matters not, I suppose. Anyway, thanks again Captain."`
	"CN-9411" `Drugub is excitedly waiting for you when you return. Though reading emotions from a giant spider proves challenging, Drugub appears to be star-struck when you mention you brought back a ship matching what he described.`
	"CN-9412" `	Once he's finished, he hands you your payment of <payment> and spends some more time with you, asking you all the questions he can think of about the ship.`
	"CN-9413" `You're window-browsing a shop in the spaceport when you catch the scuff of too quick footsteps coming toward you. Before you can glance in that direction, you're suddenly tackled into the ground by someone astonishingly human-shaped. You try to get up, but whoever attacked you pins you down, pressing your face into the ground and holding your arms behind your back to restrain you. As you struggle against your attacker you manage to catch sight of long hair and then, with a flash of concern, a glimpse of green skin - an Alpha.`
	"CN-9414" `	You are not pressed for long though. You feel the Alpha's attention shift to the side you cannot see, as an Arach swoops in with a tackle. The Alpha lets go of your arms in an attempt to block the attack, but it does not prevent the Arach from bowling them clear off of you where the two begin to wrestle in your line of sight. The Alpha is a man and, surprisingly to you, despite his strength, it doesn't take long for the Arach Heliarch to restrain your attacker. The Arach firmly pins his arms to his torso with four legs, holds his hips down with two, and uses her last pair to lever herself until she rests her entire body weight into pinning the Alpha.`
	"CN-9415" `	A Saryd Heliarch approaches and tells you to keep your distance before interposing himself partially between you and your assailant. He then looks at the Alpha and asks through his translator box, "What reason for attacking this person, did you have?"`
	"CN-9416" `	The Alpha is still struggling to try and get out of the Arach's grip, and you notice an intricate gold necklace which has splayed across his shoulder and onto the floor in the scuffle, jangling in the quiet every time he struggles. At this point, everyone else has cleared out of the area and is giving the scene a wide berth. As you get to your feet he ignores the Saryd's question and looks at you intensely. "You're with the Navy, aren't you? Finally figured out I was here, thought you'd finish the job?"`
	"CN-9417" `	"No, I'm not with the Navy. You could've just asked without slamming me to the ground."`
	"CN-9418" `	"Is that why you attacked me?"`
	"CN-9419" `	"I am with the Navy, but I didn't come here looking for you."`
	"CN-9420" `	"And I'm supposed to believe that crap?" He lashes out, trying again to knock the Arach off of him, but the agent only tightens the grip. She opens her mandibles, getting them close to the Alpha's neck. "Alright, alright, I get it!" the Alpha shouts, stopping his attempts to break free.`
	"CN-9421" `	He stares at you for a moment, as if unsure if you're telling the truth. "What the hell are you doing here then? Did you just stumble onto this place?" He stops struggling, but the Arach agent doesn't loosen her grip.`
	"CN-9422" `	The Saryd walks closer to the Alpha, stomping his hooves on the ground with each step. "Whatever your motivation was, a transgression, you have committed. Punished accordingly, you shall be," he says. "Kindly follow us to the detention facility, would you, Captain?" he asks you, but doesn't wait for an answer, as more agents arrive to escort you and the Alpha to the "detention facility."`
	"CN-9423" `	On your way there, you start feeling stings on your arms and legs, and realize the Alpha's tackle left you with some bruises. "Treat those, we will, after faced trial, your aggressor has," the Saryd says as you approach your destination: a building similar to a police station. The Alpha is brought before a Kimek that you guess is in charge of the facility. He asks you to give a testimony of what happened, with the Heliarch agents confirming what you say. "Your first offense in a long time this is, Alitis," the Kimek says, after checking a computer for the Alpha's data. "Three years in seclusion, your sentence is."`
	"CN-9424" `	After the short verdict, which seems to lack much of the due process you would expect in human space, the agents bring both you and the Alpha to a lower level of the building. This floor has several empty cells kept shut by thick, tough walls of some transparent material. While the cell block does appear to go further beyond this section and around a corner, the first few cells appear to be directly opposite a modest medical space, presumably used mostly for treating any injured prisoners without leaving the secure level. At present though, all of the cells appear to be empty, and the Heliarchs simply lock him in the second cell, where accessing his would not obstruct any other doorways. The agents then ask that you wait a few minutes for a medic to arrive so that they can take care of your bruises.`
	"CN-9425" `	You notice that cut into the transparent material of the walls are a series of small holes at head-height with a cover that can be slid across them, presumably to silence a prisoner if needed. By default, they appear to be left open, and the Heliarch agents have not closed the one on the Alpha's cell.`
	"CN-9426" `	Your eyes shift from the holes in the wall to the Alpha to find his eyes fixated on you, not looking away or even blinking. After you stare him down for a couple of seconds, he speaks up. "What is it, are you expecting some sort of apology? I'd consider my caution to be entirely justified, so you won't get one."`
	"CN-9427" `	"Who are you? How did you even get here?"`
	"CN-9428" `	"What are you doing here in the Coalition?"`
	"CN-9429" `	He frowns at you. "I don't owe you any answers, cur. Shut up and wait for the law to bring the frail princess some band-aids and a lollipop."`
	"CN-9430" `	"Are you so busy in that empty cell that you can't answer me?"`
	"CN-9431" `	"Tough talk for someone who wrestled a spider and lost."`
	"CN-9432" `	He leans forward, his legs twitching as if stopped mid-tackle, and he pauses, turning to look down the hallway to where the Heliarchs went. He backs up, slowing his breathing, and then sits down. "Alright. This may be the last time in three years I can have a proper conversation, so I will entertain you. My name... is Alitis. Over a century ago my kin stumbled upon an alien civilization beyond the Far North in conflict with bands of invaders. These invaders possessed drives capable of jumping between systems without the need for hyperspace links, technology that we greatly desired, for it could put us far outside of the reach of... you." He fixates his eyes on yours, ever so slightly closing his eyelids. "We explored the far reaches of the galaxy to the east, but found no place to call home. Our only choice was to return to the Dirt Belt where we knew of an enclave of more kin, only for the Navy," he spits on the ground, then looks at you again, "to find us. We evacuated, and my kin thought it wise to return to the east, but I knew better. I stole one of the drives my kin had along with a small ship and began traveling west. That is when I discovered the Coalition, and they have provided for me a home that I have been unable to find elsewhere in the galaxy."`
	"CN-9433" `	"You 'knew better?' What do you mean?"`
	"CN-9434" `	"What, did you have a change of heart once you got here?"`
	"CN-9435" `	He gets up in a rush. "Full of questions, aren't you?" He approaches the wall again, in slow steps. "I was among the first of my kind. Athis, I was called then. I have traveled the galaxy for many centuries and witnessed many things. I have been ambushed, cornered many times; fear was not a stranger to me, for as soulless as your kind see me, we still feel. But when I traveled to the east, someone, or... something, rather, spoke to me. A voice with an immense weight. And for the first time, I felt something more than fear. I felt dread. So when my kin decided to return to the east, I was not so inclined to return with them."`
	"CN-9436" `	"Voices in your head? Are you sure you weren't just imagining them?"`
	"CN-9437" `	"What did the voice say?"`
	"CN-9438" `	He looks away from you. "You're here now, aren't you? This means you must have a device to jump beyond links as I did. Travel to the east and find out for yourself what the voices say. Find out if it classifies you as 'disposable' as well."`
	"CN-9439" `	He looks away from you. "No imaginary thing could have such an impact on me. You're here now, aren't you? This means you must have a device to jump beyond links as I did. Travel to the east and find out for yourself that the voices are real."`
	"CN-9440" `	The Heliarchs inform you that the medic has arrived, and bring you further down the hallway to a room where they treat your bruises. They examine you briefly, then give you a tube with a thick liquid, almost like a gel, asking that you gently apply it on your wounds. Once you're done, they tell you that the pain should wear off within a few minutes, and an agent escorts you back out. Passing by his cell again, you see Alitis still standing with his back to the hallway, looking straight at the wall. The agent brings you to your ship, and thanks you for your cooperation.`
	"CN-9441" `As you exit a restaurant in the spaceport, you notice a rumpled-looking Saryd staring at you. Attention from others is not new for you in Coalition space, as you are quite an unusual sight here. You don't pay him much mind until he begins to gallop toward you, hailing you down.`
	"CN-9442" `	"Captain! Excited to finally meet you, I am. Heard of the human in our space, I have, but to see you myself, special it is."`
	"CN-9443" `	"A scientist, I am, and invited to speak at a university seminar, I have been. Be there by <date>, I must. The honor of transporting me to <planet>, will you give me?"`
	"CN-9444" `	"What is the seminar about?"`
	"CN-9445" `	"Sure, I'd be glad to transport you."`
	"CN-9446" `	"Sorry, I can't take transport jobs right now."`
	"CN-9447" `	"A xenologist, I am. Alien cultures outside of the Coalition, I study, and the topic of the seminar, it is. Invited to give lectures on the subject, I have been. Take me there, will you?"`
	"CN-9448" `	"Thank you! Aelbris, my name is. To be late I do not wish, as not recorded, the event is." He soon gathers his things and boards your ship.`
	"CN-9449" `During the trip, Aelbris was polite, if a bit intrusive in his questions about your homeworld. You answered as best you could, though at times you struggled to understand what was even being asked. Once you and your passenger depart from your ship, he turns around.`
	"CN-9450" `	"Captain, that you must be very busy, I realize, but wondering if you could stay for the seminar, I was. You see, studying human space for years, I have been, but actually met a human, I had not. A great boon to our field to have a human guest speaker, it would be."`
	"CN-9451" `	"What do I have to do there?"`
	"CN-9452" `	"I don't think that I'd be a good representative of humanity."`
	"CN-9453" `	"How do you manage to study humanity without meeting any humans?"`
	"CN-9454" `	"Sorry, I don't have time."`
	"CN-9455" `	"Answering some questions from the attendees, would you be comfortable with? Simple, they would be, about aspects of human society, physical structure, and the like, they would pertain to."`
	"CN-9456" `	"Nonsense! Travel the galaxy, you do. A most knowledgeable individual, surely you must be. Accept my offer, will you?"`
	"CN-9457" `	"Contact with a human world, Heliarchs have. Some documents on humanity, the government there gave. Shared their knowledge with civilian researchers, the Heliarchs have, so analyze the info, we do, so that understand humans better, we may."`
	"CN-9458" `	"Thank you! A great honor, you have done our field of study." He motions you to follow him.`
	"CN-9459" `	You and the Saryd take a train from the city to the base of a mountain. "Secluded, Starlit University is, so direct transportation, there is none," he explains. Instead, he leads you to a steep trail that presumably takes you to the conference. You notice that a small lift is installed along the trail, but it seems to be used exclusively by the elderly and infirm.`
	"CN-9460" `	After a long hike that takes the better part of the afternoon, you approach a collection of gleaming buildings. One of them has a few scientists and students, with Heliarchs guarding the entrance.`
	"CN-9461" `	You enter a small, dusty room where some scientists from the three Coalition species prepare their lectures. Your entrance immediately causes a stir, and several turn to look at you. Aelbris beams as he shows you to your table. You note the presence of several Heliarchs in attendance as well.`
	"CN-9462" `	"Ah, work closely with the Heliarchs, we do," Aelbris explains. "Share information with them and inform them of our conclusions, so that better informed about possible threats and opportunities, they are."`
	"CN-9463" `	"Now, unplanned, your visit is, so consult with the seminar organizers, I must." He brings out a small box that projects a holograph of an Arach Heliarch once turned on. Aelbris begins a conversation with him, but you cannot hear much of it; Aelbris makes an effort to keep his voice down in order to not disturb the other guests.`
	"CN-9464" `	You wait for a while, until a Kimek walks up to the stage in front. The box's volume is much louder than normal, and you can easily hear what is being said.`
	"CN-9465" `	"Pleased to announce that the 103rd Xenology Seminar, generously hosted by Starlit University, is now in session, I am. Noticed as you may have, in the presence of a very... unusual guest, we are. The honor of having <first> <last> answer some questions at the end of today's seminar, we will have." The Kimek gestures to you as Aelbris sits down at your table.`
	"CN-9466" `	The first speaker, another Kimek, talks about human farming methods as they compare to other members of the Coalition. You see him cite information from a modified data chip that appears to contain documents from the Library of Alexandria.`
	"CN-9467" `	The seminar goes on for some time. A Saryd gives a surprisingly accurate lecture on the human body. An Arach goes into detail explaining the technological level of human ships. Once all the speakers have finished, Aelbris informs you that it is now your turn to answer their questions.`
	"CN-9468" `	"Alright, let's go!"`
	"CN-9469" `	"I don't want to do this anymore."`
	"CN-9470" `	"To answer their questions, if you really don't want, I can't stop you, I suppose." Aelbris says with a sigh.`
	"CN-9471" `	As soon as you walk up to the stage, several scientists in the crowd stand up out of their chairs. The Arach Heliarch comes up to you on the stage, and explains that this is their way of asking questions. She selects a Saryd from the crowd.`
	"CN-9472" `	"What is the extent of contact that humans have with other aliens?"`
	"CN-9473" `	"Humans are in contact with the Hai. Some of them even live on Hai planets. They live to the north of human space, and we can visit them through a wormhole."`
	"CN-9474" `	"A few humans know about the Hai, but there's no official acknowledgment of their existence. They live to the north of human space, and we can visit them through a wormhole."`
	"CN-9475" `	"Humans have official contact with the Quarg, but the Quarg don't trade technology with humanity."`
	"CN-9476" `	"Humans have official contact with the Quarg, but humans and Quarg don't really intermix."`
	"CN-9477" `	"Humans know about the Quarg, but most people know little about them."`
	"CN-9478" `	The audience response is muted. You get the impression that you haven't told them anything they don't already know.`
	"CN-9479" `	Several members of the audience are delighted. "Unknown to us, this species is," says the Heliarch. "That you have made contact with them despite the Quarg, good news it is."`
	"CN-9480" `	Several members of the audience are delighted. "Ah, the Hai, we have heard of," says the Heliarch. "That you have made contact with them despite the Quarg, good news it is."`
	"CN-9481" `	"Tell us more of them, could you?" asks another scientist.`
	"CN-9482" `	As you open your mouth to speak, the Heliarch cuts you off. "Enough questions on the Hai, we have." The crowd looks disappointed at this development.`
	"CN-9483" `	The Arach selects another, this time a Kimek. "All of human space, united politically is it?"`
	"CN-9484" `	"No, human space is split between the Republic in the north and the Free Worlds in the south."`
	"CN-9485" `	"No, human space is split between the Republic in the west, the Free Worlds in the south, and the Syndicate in the east. The Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, but they have a lot of autonomy."`
	"CN-9486" `	"Yes, all of human space is united under the Republic."`
	"CN-9487" `	"Yes, but there are internal subdivisions: the Free Worlds in the south, the Republic in the north, and the Syndicate in the east."`
	"CN-9488" `	"No. Technically all of human space is under the Republic, but the Syndicate has significant autonomy."`
	"CN-9489" `	"No. Technically all of human space is under the Republic, but the Free Worlds and Syndicate have significant autonomy."`
	"CN-9490" `	As you answer the question, your translator begins to cut out. Repeating your answer does no good, as it continues to fizzle out as you talk. You look over to the Heliarch, who eyes the curious Kimek with suspicion. "Apologize for the malfunction, I must," says the Heliarch. "The next question, answer it please."`
	"CN-9491" `	Upon finishing your sentence, several in the crowd begin to write down notes on datapads. It appears that information on human government is new to them.`
	"CN-9492" `	The Arach picks another Kimek. "Piracy in human space, how big of a problem is it?"`
	"CN-9493" `	"There are entire pirate planets on the fringes of human space where warlords and criminals rule."`
	"CN-9494" `	"Piracy was a big problem in the past, but now it's a relatively minor issue."`
	"CN-9495" `	"There are many independent worlds that are not ruled by one singular government. Some groups there support piracy, but others are peaceful."`
	"CN-9496" `	"Stamped out, may lawlessness soon be," says the Heliarch in a solemn tone of voice. She picks a Saryd for the next question.`
	"CN-9497" `	Your microphone starts to fizzle out as you attempt to answer. The Heliarch's eight eyes are all on you, and you sense that it might not be a good idea to finish your sentence. The Heliarch selects a Saryd for the next question.`
	"CN-9498" `	"A fairly comprehensive map of human space, we have." The Saryd brings out a star map of the galactic south. "But of the core, we know not. Inform us of the galaxy, can you?"`
	"CN-9499" `	(Tell them about the Korath.)`
	"CN-9500" `	(Don't tell them about the Korath.)`
	"CN-9501" `	"Sorry, I don't know what's there any more than you do."`
	"CN-9502" `	The Saryd walks away, disappointed.`
	"CN-9503" `	"I've met an alien species there called the Korath," you say. "They're reptilian creatures. What's left of their planets has been ruined by infighting. The Kor Sestor and Kor Mereti have been fighting a civil war using autonomous ships. The Kor Efreti have stayed out of the civil war, living under the Quarg's protection. The Korath Exiles have been banished to the Core by the Drak for refusing to give up their ability to manufacture jump drives. They are now raiding humanity for supplies."`
	"CN-9504" `	The crowd shows considerable interest at this last part. "Knowledge of the jump drive, a species besides the Quarg possesses? Great news, this is! Our struggle against the Quarg, we do not take up alone. Possess jump drives, do any other species?" The Heliarch does not seem to mind you answering another question.`
	"CN-9505" `	"There are aliens to the north of human space called the Hai. Some of them steal from the normal Hai, and try to get their hands on jump drives any way they can."`
	"CN-9506" `	"There is a faction among the Hai, the Unfettered. They steal from the normal Hai, and try to get their hands on jump drives any way they can."`
	"CN-9507" `	"Sorry, I don't know of any other species that does."`
	"CN-9508" `	The Heliarch speaks up against the murmurs of the crowd. "Driven to such desperation, it is unfortunate that our allies against the Quarg are. Powerful like the Coalition, hopefully one day they will be."`
	"CN-9509" `	Several members of the audience are delighted. "Unknown to us, this species is," says the Heliarch. "Powerful in their fight against the Quarg, may they become."`
	"CN-9510" `	The crowd's mood dampens a bit, but everyone is still quite exuberant as you leave the building. It is now night, and your eyes take a moment to adjust from the lecture hall's bright lights. Aelbris meets up with you outside, bubbling with excitement.`
	"CN-9511" `	Upon the announcement of the interview's end, the crowd begins to leave. The mood is exuberant as you exit the building. It is now night, and your eyes take a moment to adjust from the lecture hall's bright lights. Aelbris meets up with you outside, bubbling with excitement.`
	"CN-9512" `	"Thank you, captain! Expanded our knowledge greatly, you have." He leans in, quieter this time. "Strict with knowledge of humans, the Heliarchs are. Unbiased sources of information, rare they are. Hope to see you again, I do. Safe travels!"`
	"CN-9513" `	After he shakes your hand, you say your goodbyes and board your ship.`
	"CN-9514" `Shortly after entering the spaceport, you catch the attention of a Saryd lady with gray, braided hair that reaches to her shoulders dragging along a single suitcase. "Hello, Captain. Taking new passengers, are you?" she asks. She shows you a piece of jewelry on her hand, a small bronze bangle with a diamond at the center. "Vellorae, my name is, and in need of a transport for a pilgrimage, I am."`
	"CN-9515" `	"Pilgrimage? What do you mean?"`
	"CN-9516" `	"Are you offering to pay me with that? I only take credits."`
	"CN-9517" `	"Sorry, I'm not looking to take any jobs right now."`
	"CN-9518" `	She gazes at the bangle, clenching her hand as she raises it closer to her face. "The remains of my late husband, Adfices, this is. Passed away recently, he has, and visit certain sites of worship, I want to, so that wish him a safe journey, I may."`
	"CN-9519" `	"You turned your husband into jewelry?"`
	"CN-9520" `	"I'm sorry for your loss. I'd be glad to help; could you tell me where you wish to go?"`
	"CN-9521" `	"My condolences, but I'm not looking to take more jobs right now."`
	"CN-9522" `	"A common practice, in Saryd families it is. Made out of cremation ashes, and much better at preserving memories of loved ones, these gemstones are." She explains. "Since developed, the technique was, practiced by nearly all who could afford it, it has been. To have the rivers and fields share our sorrow, we wish not. So nearly unheard of nowadays, Saryd burials are."`
	"CN-9523" `	"Well, I'd be glad to help you. Could you tell me where you wish to go?"`
	"CN-9524" `	"I see. Well, I hope everything goes well, but I can't help you. I'm not looking for any jobs right now."`
	"CN-9525" `	"Thank you, Captain. Five different sites, I wish to visit, and traditionally the first of them, the Shrine of Aul Kell is. On <destination>, it is. Once there we are, easy to find in the capital, it should be."`
	"CN-9526" `	You show her to your ship, helping her settle in her bunk. Once you're done, you set a course for <planet>.`
	"CN-9527" `Once you land on <origin>, Vellorae hands you 34,500 credits, and checks with a local tour line for the easiest path to the shrine. "Kindly wait for me, would you, Captain? Take a few hours, I might." She says. "Of course, if to come with me, you wish, happy to have your company, I would be."`
	"CN-9528" `	"If you're okay with me going, I'd be glad to accompany you."`
	"CN-9529" `	"Sorry, I'm not in the mood for a mourning ritual."`
	"CN-9530" `	Together you follow the streets out of the spaceport city and into a park filled with several different forms of trees twisting upon themselves; some reach far up to the skies while others anchor most of their branches into the ground. The trail brings you to a large clearing, where dozens of Saryds are gathered by a circle of tall, rocky pillars with an altar at the center. Many of the Saryds there are dressed in delicate fabrics of dark greens or ocher colors. Some of them are grouped into pairs that seem to be young couples, while others appear to simply be passing visitors to the shrine.`
	"CN-9531" `	Once the sun peeks over the tree tops and into the clearing, the visitors move away from the pillars and the altar while the couples line up and walk to it one at a time. There they remain for a few minutes, speaking to one another, before moving aside for the next pair. "Exchanging their vows, they are," Vellorae explains. "Our most popular wedding locations, the shrines here on the capital are."`
	"CN-9532" `	"I thought this was a shrine for mourning the dead?"`
	"CN-9533" `	"Popular? In the middle of the woods, by some rocks?"`
	"CN-9534" `	She looks at you in confusion, then chuckles. "The creator of all forests, Aul Kell is, so naturally inside forests, his shrines are. Odd, I suppose they may look, to one outside our culture."`
	"CN-9535" `	"Attributed with the gift of sunlight, Aul Kell is. As such, seek his blessings in the shrines, for many occasions we do. Only some of them, mourning and espousals are."`
	"CN-9536" `	The couples keep exchanging their vows until just before midday, when the sun is nearly over the central altar. At this point, the Saryds all look around the clearing, making space for Vellorae as they see her approaching the shrine. She places the bangle atop the altar so it catches the sun's light, reflecting it throughout the clearing. Vellorae then begins walking around the altar, repeatedly circling it as the sun climbs higher, until it finally reaches its peak and the sun's reflection on the gem is strongest. At this point, she approaches the altar again and covers the bangle with her hands. She remains there silently for a moment, and then she retrieves the bangle and leaves the shrine. As she walks past, the other Saryds give her sympathetic looks, and one of the younger ones even approaches to offer her condolences before Vellorae approaches you again.`
	"CN-9537" `	"Finished I am, Captain. Back to the ship, we may go," she says once she's beside you. You two head back; this time you pass by a few more Saryds on the trail and return to your ship.`
	"CN-9538" `	You wait for a few hours by the spaceport city until Vellorae returns about an hour after noon.`
	"CN-9539" `	"<destination>, the next stop is. To give Adfices Velaulra's Blessing, I wish," she says, heading into her bunk as you prepare for the next trip.`
	"CN-9540" `Vellorae directs you to a part of the planet cut by a long, thin river, pays you 49,300 credits once you've landed at one of the available hangars in a larger village, and sets out for a marble rotunda by the river banks.`
	"CN-9541" `	Following her there, you see some Saryd mothers playing with their children. Others hold young infants or carefully bathe them in the waters. As the two of you step into the rotunda, you notice the painting on the ceiling: a Saryd woman laying in a field, watching over several children playing around her.`
	"CN-9542" `	Vellorae turns to you, removing the bangle and holding it in both hands as she presents it to you. "Join me for a silent prayer, could you, Captain? Wish to disturb one of the young mothers here, I do not."`
	"CN-9543" `	"If this place is a shrine, what's with all the kids playing around as if it was a park?"`
	"CN-9544" `	"Sorry, I'm not one for prayers."`
	"CN-9545" `	"Of course. What do I have to do?"`
	"CN-9546" `	"A deity of life and plenty, Velaulra is, and as the greatest bounty of all, life is, strong ties with newborn children, she has. Common places for mothers to bond with their young ones, her shrines are." Vellorae explains. "In my case, here to thank her for Adfices' life, and all plenty there was in it, I am. Take my hands for a prayer, would you?"`
	"CN-9547" `	"I know this is important for you, but I'm not one for prayers. Sorry."`
	"CN-9548" `	"I don't fully understand this, but I'd be glad to. What do I have to do?"`
	"CN-9549" `	"I see. That's fine, understand it, I do." She holds the bangle in one hand, covering it with the other, and closes her eyes for just under a minute while standing there in silence.`
	"CN-9550" `	"Just over mine, place yours." She gestures with her hands, and you both place them over the bangle. She closes her eyes as you do the same. You both stand still like that for just under a minute until you feel her move away.`
	"CN-9551" `	After the prayer, Vellorae leaves the rotunda and heads to the river bank, where she lays close to the waters and lowers the bangle to start washing it in the current in a slow and clearly ceremonial manner. The Saryd children watch her curiously, some edging closer before being stopped by their mothers. Once Vellorae is done, she places the bangle, still wet from the river, on her hand again and tells you that she's done at this shrine.`
	"CN-9552" `	You head back to your ship, where she tells you she'd like to stop at <destination> next. "Visit Magl Ina next, I must." She heads to her bunk, and you go to your cockpit to set course for <planet>.`
	"CN-9553" `<origin>'s spaceport searchlights guide you to the hangars in the middle of a thunderstorm, and Vellorae says she'll wait it out inside your ship as she pays you 45,500 credits. "At her shrine only after dusk, Magl Ina is anyway, so in a hurry, I am not." The storm lasts halfway into the evening, and once the light reaching through the layers of fog starts to dim, you open your ship's hatch for Vellorae to head out.`
	"CN-9554" `	You accompany her across the murky spaceport, until you find a local Saryd for her to talk to. Vellorae asks him if he would guide the two of you to the shrine. "To a site of worship, why is this human going?" he asks, while eyeing you somewhat suspiciously.`
	"CN-9555" `	"On a pilgrimage to mourn my late husband, I am." Vellorae says. "Helping me with traveling to each shrine, Captain <last> is."`
	"CN-9556" `	"But, to the shrine, must the Captain go?" He asks. "Help you with mourning there, a human cannot."`
	"CN-9557" `	"Helping me in this journey, the kind Captain has been, so mind it, I do not. Like to come with me to the shrine, would you, Captain?"`
	"CN-9558" `	"If it's alright for me to go, I'd love to."`
	"CN-9559" `	"I don't want to disturb anyone, so I'll stay by the ship and wait for you."`
	"CN-9560" `	"Wonderful!" she cheers, tapping her frontal hooves lightly on the ground. "Now, guide us to the shrine, would you, young dear?" she asks the local Saryd, who turns around and gestures for you to follow.`
	"CN-9561" `	You stick close to Vellorae as the two of you try to keep the local Saryd in sight. The task is difficult as he nearly vanishes into the fog whenever he gets too far ahead, only for his silhouette to become clearer again after he waits for you to catch up. After many minutes, you feel the ground beneath your shoes shift from the solid spaceport platform to gravel to wet patches of the planet's mossy "grass." Finally you reach a minuscule lake, or perhaps a very large puddle, in the middle of a mossy field surrounded by toppled and hollowed out tree trunks.`
	"CN-9562" `	As the two of you approach the water, the local Saryd warns you not to touch it. Vellorae looks at it as if gazing into a mirror, or perhaps she is just trying to make out the reflection of the moon, scattered and vague through the layers of mist. She then moves to one of the tree trunks, and placing the bangle inside it as she lays on the ground facing the water, lays both her hands reverently on the trunk. She spends nearly an hour in this position, during which the chill of the fog slowly seeps through your coat and into your bones. Vellorae and the Saryd who guided you don't seem particularly bothered by it, but she is quick to finish once she looks over and notices you shivering. She picks the bangle up from the trunk and stands, and then asks the other Saryd to guide you two back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-9563" `	"For taking so long, terribly sorry I am, Captain <last>," she says on the way back. "Lost in prayer I was, not even consider how uncomfortable the cold must've been for you, I did."`
	"CN-9564" `	"Don't worry, wasn't too bad. Seems you were really involved in praying."`
	"CN-9565" `	"Why did this one take so long? Is there something special about the shrine's deity?"`
	"CN-9566" `	"The hunter bird of nightfall and omens, Magl Ina is. When mourning someone dear, one is, ask it for forgiveness for their wrongdoings, they must."`
	"CN-9567" `	You follow the Saryd back to the gravel path and then to the spaceport grounds, where Vellorae thanks him for guiding the two of you to the shrine. He offers his condolences and wishes her a safe journey to the next shrine. He soon disappears into the fog again, and you and Vellorae head back to your ship.`
	"CN-9568" `	She sighs briefly, and agrees to meet with you later, following the Saryd local deep into the fog stretching out of the city. You head inside your ship, waiting for a few hours until you hear a voice just outside your hatch. You let Vellorae in once you realize that it's hers.`
	"CN-9569" `	"To <destination>, we must go now. The Path of Lor Ie Vees, I must take," she says, heading to her bunk to rest.`
	"CN-9570" `Vellorae hands you 69,700 credits as you land, and says she'll head to the "path" once the sun sets. "Come to this world for our honeymoon, Adfices and I did, and visited the path, we had. Know its starting point, I already do."`
	"CN-9571" `	She tells you she'll pass the time until then by visiting local shops, asking if you'd like to come with her.`
	"CN-9572" `	(Go along with her.)`
	"CN-9573" `	(Stay in my ship.)`
	"CN-9574" `	She takes you around the spaceport city, touring some clothing shops and bringing you to parks she had visited with her husband. Shortly after noon you two enter a restaurant, where she insists on paying for your meal. You tour the city with her for a while longer and, just before the sun sets, reach the forest at the base of the mountain on top of which Starlit University is located.`
	"CN-9575" `	Once night falls, many lights start to appear inside the forest, and Vellorae beckons you to follow her in. "Stick close, you should. Difficult to navigate the path, for other species it often is." As you walk down a trail with her, you approach one of the lights to see that it's a bonfire on a platform in a miniature clearing, at what you hope is a safe distance from the trees around it. Continuing to the next light, Vellorae clutches the bangle in her hands the entire time, humming some guttural, almost tribal chant. As you pass by another fire, a short burst of flames gets closer to some nearby shrubs, but thankfully is put out before it can cause any harm. It is extinguished with an odd, large, fabric net on a pole by a cloaked Saryd who seemed to materialize from the trees near the fire.`
	"CN-9576" `	"Take care to not damage the forest with the path's fires, we must, so volunteer for keeping the flames, many of the local students do." Vellorae tells you. "When visiting here, Adfices and I were, wondered if any extra credits, the task granted, but apparently only out of a respect for Lor Ie Vees, the students do it."`
	"CN-9577" `	"Why? Is that some god of knowledge?"`
	"CN-9578" `	"Maybe they like being on good terms with the divine in hopes of doing well in tests?"`
	"CN-9579" `	She stops for a second to laugh. "The case, that might be." She looks around, seeing if someone else caught her breaking the serene, humming chant.`
	"CN-9580" `	"Taught the first Saryds how to hunt, he did. To pursue knowledge, and overcome challenges, his teachings are." She explains. "Seek communion with him, not only students, but all going through a difficult period, should."`
	"CN-9581" `	You continue to follow her closely through the forest, regularly passing more bonfires, until you see multiple lights in the distance and realize it is the edge of the forest leading back into the city. Only as you step out of the woods do you notice that you're back where the path started, even though you were certain you had kept to only one side of the mountain.`
	"CN-9582" `	Vellorae takes a final look at the path, where only a few of the bonfires' lights are still visible through the dense groupings of pine trees. She tells you she's ready to leave, and you bring her back to your ship.`
	"CN-9583" `	She says she'll be back at night and leaves. You watch a few transmissions from the planet, most of them in some way related to Starlit University. One is what you guess is a Saryd comedy movie, something about one who cut down trees in order to make scarves but came to regret it later. You try and follow along, but subtitles for the transmissions only come in Kimek or Arach. A few hours into the night, you leave your ship to wait for Vellorae, who arrives shortly after.`
	"CN-9584" `	She heads to her bunk, saying she'll rest for the trip. It hits you that she hasn't told you her next destination yet, so you knock on her door to ask.`
	"CN-9585" `	"Yes, Captain? Anything wrong, is- Ah! Forgot to tell you the next destination, I have!" You nod, and she looks at her bangle, brushing a hand on its gem. "Yes, the last shrine, the next one is... the next one..."`
	"CN-9586" `	"Is something wrong with the next shrine?"`
	"CN-9587" `	She ignores your question, fixated on the bangle for a few moments. "<planet>. To <destination>, we must go." She finally says, before going back to her room.`
	"CN-9588" `Vellorae hands you <payment> once you land, and asks, "Come with me for this last bit, could you, Captain <last>?"`
	"CN-9589" `	"Sure. Where are we going?"`
	"CN-9590" `	"I'll pass. I'm not up for it right now."`
	"CN-9591" `	Her eyes go to the bangle, travel around the room, and then fixate on your again. "Please, Captain? I know that agreed to follow me to the shrines for the job, you didn't, but alone there, I do not wish to be."`
	"CN-9592" `	"Alright, if it'll help you relax I'll go with you."`
	"CN-9593" `	"Sorry, but I'd rather rest in the ship."`
	"CN-9594" `	She takes a step back, looking down to the bangle again. "Alright. Yes, your responsibility, this is not. Meet you in the spaceport later, I shall."`
	"CN-9595" `	You open the hatch for her, and she heads to one of the Saryds nearby and begins to talk to them. A few seconds into the conversation, they tense up, crossing their arms and swiping them down as if refusing something, then running off. She tries again with some of the other Saryds, but continues to be rejected. She looks back at your ship dejectedly, then starts eyeing the other ships docked nearby before heading toward a Kimek Thorn that has just landed. As she talks to the captain, the Kimek seems confused, but after a moment he briefly re-enters their ship, returning in a puffy coat to follow Vellorae to the railway hub.`
	"CN-9596" `	Long after the sun has set, the Kimek returns, rushing to their ship while trying to shake off the cold. You ask them about Vellorae, and they tell you she headed for the spaceport to "clear her head."`
	"CN-9597" `	She takes a long, deep breath. "Thank you, Captain. Far outside the village, the site is. Come, show you the way there, I will." You leave your ship, follow her to the railway hub, and board one of trains that appears to be one of the oldest and most simple. It lacks seats for non-Saryds, so you are forced to hold tight to what handrails you can reach.`
	"CN-9598" `	You remain on the train until the very last stop, when the sun is already starting to set. As you depart, you see a rural village with just a few dozen buildings and a simple dirt road, where a couple workers battle the snow and ice to keep it clear and easy to traverse. You follow Vellorae down the road, and once you reach a rocky pillar with a hole carved through it, she turns to the forest, heading out on a thin, straight trail. Looking behind you, you see the setting sun fitting inside the pillar's opening.`
	"CN-9599" `	As you follow Vellorae down the trail, you see the trees gradually show more and more signs of a forest fire, with darker, damaged barks, increasingly ashy soil, and many fallen, decomposing portions of the forest. The trail ends abruptly at a large scar scorched through the forest. The piles of ash still present below your feet almost resemble the rest of the planet's otherwise snowy ground, but somehow are kept from mixing with the snow. Whether deliberately cleared by more workers or some other force, you cannot tell. Near the center of the scar you see a small mound with an opening in the side, almost like a "shack" made out of the charred tree trunks and rocks. A faint light comes from within it.`
	"CN-9600" `	While you're looking at the mound, Vellorae grabs your hand and starts hesitantly pulling you toward it. Inside, the fading sunlight behind you contrasts with the source of the light within, a small pyre in the middle of the "shack" which has only a few lone flames dancing on the embers. Vellorae lays down in front of it, removes her bangle, and places it in the flames for a brief moment before snatching it up and standing again. Once on her feet, she grabs your hand again, tugging you along as she hurries back to the edge of the scorched clearing.`
	"CN-9601" `	She seems to settle again once you have reached the trail, letting go of your hand and slowing her pace.`
	"CN-9602" `	"What was that about? What got you so agitated?"`
	"CN-9603" `	(Stay quiet.)`
	"CN-9604" `	She doesn't answer your question, instead simply continuing down the trail. Once you pass the rocky pillar and are back on the proper road again, she finally speaks up. "That... to gift us sunlight, stole the eyes of Ensu Uri, Aul Kell did. Broken apart, It was, and of the light from Its eyes, only specks remained. But finished, It was not, so to implore Adfices is kept safe from It, this was."`
	"CN-9605" `	The two of you head back to the village and take the old train back to the railway hub. "Wait for you in the spaceport I will, Captain," Vellorae says. "Clear my head before heading back home, I must."`
	"CN-9606" `You find Vellorae in a snack shop, finishing up a hot drink. "Apologize for the wait I must, Captain. Ready to leave, I was not."`
	"CN-9607" `	"Thought you'd be feeling better than this. You've finally finished your pilgrimage, after all."`
	"CN-9608" `	"I get it. Sometimes I also need a drink to help me think things over."`
	"CN-9609" `	She chuckles. "A herbal tea, this is. Help me calm down and rest on the way back home, it will."`
	"CN-9610" `	"Yes, relieved I feel, that able to do this, I was. Just... still coming to terms with everything, I am."`
	"CN-9611" `	She finishes the drink and gets up to pay for her order, following you to your ship afterwards. "Ready to head back home, I am," she tells you, heading into her bunk as you prepare the course for <destination>.`
	"CN-9612" `Once she leaves your ship, Vellorae gives you your payment of <payment>, and takes your hands in hers. "Deeply grateful I am, for having accompanied me in this journey, Captain <last>. Sure that grateful for your help, Adfices also is."`
	"CN-9613" `	She lets go of your hands, wishes you the best in your travels, and then turns and leaves for her home.`
	"CN-9614" `Shortly after you enter the spaceport, an Arach in a sturdy, red uniform, with golden "pauldrons" on each of his legs' joints, approaches you. "Greetings, Captain <last>," he says. "Interested in taking up some transport jobs, are you? Very well paid, you would be."`
	"CN-9615" `	"What are the jobs about?"`
	"CN-9616" `	"Paid how well, exactly?"`
	"CN-9617" `	"Sorry, I'm not looking for that type of job right now."`
	"CN-9618" `	"Happening soon, the Council of Ahr is. Gather on the capital, all Arach houses do. Discuss matters related to Arach space, they will, alongside my lieges of the royal family. Paid <payment>, you would be, if to <destination> by <date>, the remaining representatives of the houses, you brought."`
	"CN-9619" `	"Sounds simple enough. Who are these representatives?"`
	"CN-9620" `	"Can you tell me more about the Council?"`
	"CN-9621" `	"That sounds like it might take a while, and I'm rather busy, so I'll pass."`
	"CN-9622" `	"Of course. A few centuries after leaving our home planet, entangled in petty wars, the more prominent houses were. Fearing for the fate of their subjects, called for the first Council, the royal family at the time did. A more civil way to solve disputes, it became, and though war still, many of the houses did, far less frequent, the conflicts were. Now that at peace we are, merely a traditional meeting, it is, taking place every few years, so that discuss how to improve the conditions of Arach space, the houses may."`
	"CN-9623" `	He shows you a data pad, pointing to three symbols on the screen as he names the houses from left to right. "Issues with her other transport, the representative of House Bebliss had, so waiting on Stronghold of Flugbu, she still is. Word that House Chamgar is ready for the Council, I just received, and on Hammer of Debrugt, their member is. Spare some time for the Council, House Ablomab finally can, and waiting for you on Delve of Bloptab, their envoy is.`
	"CN-9624" `	"Receive your payment, you will, once on <planet>, the three representatives are. I shall inform the houses that expect you, they should. Thankful for your assistance, the royal family is."`
	"CN-9625" `	He briefly bows his head while stretching his legs in some sort of salute, then disappears into the spaceport. Once you're at your ship, you place markers on <stopovers>, where the representatives are waiting.`
	"CN-9626" `You land on <origin> to find that House Ablomab's representative had to oversee an "emergency meltdown drill" on the neighboring planet, Bloptab's Furnace. His interplanetary shuttle still hasn't arrived, so you're left to wait for him on the spaceport.`
	"CN-9627" `	He finally arrives some hours after sunset, dragging along a heavy suitcase and barely holding on to what must be the Arach equivalent of coffee. As you help him with the heavy luggage, he introduces himself as Dubug. "Sorry about the wait, I am. Replace a coworker on the meltdown drill, I had to. A routine task, it is, but also routine, the Council is, so care much for the delay, the house did not. Show me to my room, could you?"`
	"CN-9628" `	While you're both walking to your ship, he finishes his drink, but it doesn't seem to help him keep his eyes open; you have to help him avoid bumping into either the other Arachi here or the spaceport decorations. Although he doesn't seem very talkative, it might help his focus to get a conversation going.`
	"CN-9629" `	"So, what can you tell me about house Ablomab?"`
	"CN-9630" `	"Is it difficult having to deal with all the other houses in the Council?"`
	"CN-9631" `	"This Council is hosted by a royal family, right? What can you tell me about them?"`
	"CN-9632" `	"The ninth house? Not much to say, there is. Agreed as the 'royals' they were, in ancient times. Never much power, they had, merely a figure of stability, made to assure peace on Ahr. Host the Council, they do, but a tradition it is. Otherwise, mostly to themselves, they keep."`
	"CN-9633" `	He grunts lightly. "The deepest mines and biggest smelters in all the Coalition, we have. Overseeing construction, assuring ore purity, testing the quality of alloys, our most common responsibilities are. In order, everything must be, so that met, the quotas for house Mallob's and the Heliarchs' ships are."`
	"CN-9634" `	"Started out as noble families from Ahr, most of the houses did. When first mapped out, Arach space was, carved their own portions, the houses did, and naturally for more systems, many fought. Now at ease with each other, the houses are, and ceased, the territorial disputes have." He sighs. "For the most part."`
	"CN-9635" `	Dubug makes it to your ship still awake, but doesn't care to answer when you ask if he needs help unpacking his luggage. Instead, he lays on the bed and asks that you wake him up once you arrive on <planet>.`
	"CN-9636" `Having rested during the trip here, Dubug stretches his legs once he steps off your ship. "All the reports from my house, I've brought, so prepared for the Council, I am," he says, checking his suitcase one more time. "Well then, go I must. Goodbye, Captain <last>. Thankful for the calm trip, I am. A good break from routine, it was."`
	"CN-9637" `Once your ship has landed, you receive a message from House Bebliss, directing you to a large hotel in the spaceport city. The security guards don't let you in, so you wait for the representative to come out. About half an hour of waiting later, an elevator nearby opens and many Arachi come out, most of them in formal uniforms and carrying various bags of luggage. An older Arach stands out from the rest on account of being even more formally dressed.`
	"CN-9638" `	"My transport to the Council you are, correct?" She asks, and you confirm. "Splendid. Lady Plubat, I am, Captain. Pleased that transport the will of House Bebliss, such an exquisite captain shall. Finally right, those arranging the transport to the Council have gotten it."`
	"CN-9639" `	She asks you to lead the way to your ship as the other uniformed Arachi follow the two of you, carrying her luggage. "Told, I was, about which representatives tasked with transporting, you were. Bebliss excepted, not the most... intriguing company, they are, so grateful that you're transporting at least one proper guest, you should be."`
	"CN-9640" `	"Looks like you hold your house in very high regards."`
	"CN-9641" `	"You don't seem very excited for the Council. Is there something wrong with the other houses?"`
	"CN-9642" `	"Is there anything I should know about the hosts of the Council? I heard they were royalty."`
	"CN-9643" `	"The Oberegts? Well, for one, one of the few houses to honor their noble lineage, they are. Elected as a figurehead, in ancient times they were. Never more than that, they have been, lacking real power and focusing only on Ahr, though contributed much to our understanding of medicine, they have. A figurehead, they are, but a good one, and as such some degree of respect, I must grant them."`
	"CN-9644" `	"Keep the Coalition together, House Bebliss does. What makes communication from one system to another possible, our efforts are. Other than the obvious importance of our work, one of the few houses that kept their noble bloodline pure, and who kept their original emblems, we are. Prejudice against those the other houses mixed with, I have not, but greatly value tradition, we do, and broken tradition, they have, in marrying commoners or... those of other species."`
	"CN-9645" `	"Drifted away from our old ways, most of them have. Take Mallob and Garbarag: barely houses anymore, they are. Fully transitioned into corporations, they have. Claim noble heritage, Debdo does, but in fact a splinter group of our own house, they are, the traitorous offshoots. The worst of them all, however, House Chamgar is. Lunatics clinging on to an ancient rivalry, they are, liars and revisionists who to tarnish our image, wish. Declare war on us, they would, if subjected to the Heliarch government, our houses were not."`
	"CN-9646" `	Once you make it to your ship, she has the Arach butlers tidy up her room, then dismisses them. She tells you she will call for you should she need anything then closes the door to her room.`
	"CN-9647" `You land to find a group of Arachi in uniform waiting nearby, ready to carry Plubat's baggage from your ship. "A delightful flight it was, Captain. Hope that you are picked again to transport me in the future, I do," she says, bidding you farewell and leaving for a nearby transport shuttle.`
	"CN-9648" `Lady Plubat rushes out of your ship to meet a group of Arachi in uniform, some of which carry her baggage from your ship, while others surround her as if expecting House Chamgar's Plubat to try and stir up a discussion. Once all her bags are out, they escort her to a nearby transport shuttle.`
	"CN-9649" `You can barely step off your ship before House Chamgar's representative greets you. "Honored that transporting me, such an esteemed pilot is, Captain <last>. Certain, I am, that honored you also are. An important task it is, to transport one from the great House Chamgar. Plubat, my name is, and as time we still have, show you our installations I must."`
	"CN-9650" `	He drags you around the eccentric spaceport, bringing you to odd exhibits where some pieces of technology are being constructed or repaired, going on about House Chamgar's advances. The tour goes on for some hours as you pretend to be impressed by what he calls "the newest prototypes" (most of which look like standard Coalition technology). Only after he drags you around again, stopping at a nearby hotel where he picks up his luggage, do you finally get him to follow you to your ship.`
	"CN-9651" `	It doesn't take long for him to get started again. "Now, Captain <last>, time for a full tour of our spaceport facilities, today we don't have; to the Council, we must go, but happy to answer your many questions about our great house, I am. Wondering how we invented our repair modules, are you? Or maybe by our special alloys, intrigued you are?"`
	"CN-9652" `	"Well, why don't you tell me a bit about your house?"`
	"CN-9653" `	"How about you tell me about the other houses that are going to the Council?"`
	"CN-9654" `	"Actually, I'm curious about the hosts of the Council."`
	"CN-9655" `	He stops dead in his tracks. "The royals? Well, not much to say, there is. Chosen as such on a primitive Ahr, only symbolic, their role is. Never held any ambition, they have, remaining the weakest house since formed. Assured stability on the capital, they have, and in good relations with us, they are, for recognize our value, they do, so bad, they are not, only uninteresting."`
	"CN-9656" `	You can barely finish your question, as he begins what is undoubtedly a rehearsed speech. "The greatest Arach warriors of old, we were, and always at the forefront of scientific progress and creative inventions. For the brilliant breakthrough that were our repair modules, persecuted by the Quarg, we were, but here, in this system, on this planet, held a chokepoint, we did. Guarded Arach space from them, for centuries we had to, until banished with the help of our Saryd and Kimek friends, they were."`
	"CN-9657" `	"Alright, most of them are. Amicable relations with nearly all houses, we maintain. Except with the scum from Bebliss, lying, treacherous snakes they are. Conspiring against the government, helping rebels they are! 'Their' world, Stronghold of Flugbu is not, stolen from us, it was. Heed my warning, Captain: trust them, you should not, preferable to trust a Quarg, it is."`
	"CN-9658" `	He seems ready to have you ask another question, but as you reach your ship, he picks up a call on a communication device and signals for you to show him to his room. He then says that he must handle some business, and that he'll talk to you again later.`
	"CN-9659" `"Captain <last>! A pleasurable experience for the both of us, this has been, but sadly short, the trip from my home to <planet> is, so part ways, we must," Plubat says as he prepares to leave your ship. "To finish the tour of our facilities, I'm sure you want, so once over, the Council is, ask for me there, and guide you again, I shall."`
	"CN-9660" `House Chamgar's representative, Plubat, stays close to you while firmly clinging to his luggage, as his colleague from house Bebliss, Lady Plubat, has her bags brought out of your ship by some nearby Arachi in uniform. "Telling you I am, Captain, trusted, she should not be. Checked your ship, have you? All in place, your belongings are? Careful with her types, you must be," he says. After the Bebliss butlers are done, Plubat scoffs something at Lady Plubat one last time, then leaves your ship.`
	"CN-9661" `After departing from <origin>, you start hearing some shouting from outside your cockpit, so you leave to check up on your passengers. Plubat, from House Chamgar, is banging one leg against the door to the room of Plubat, from House Bebliss. "Captain! Good thing that here, you are," he says. "Sent an envoy to mock me, that damned house Bebliss has! Copying my name, she is!"`
	"CN-9662" `	Plubat, from House Bebliss, opens the door to her room to respond. "Nonsense that is, Captain. Look at us, several decades older, I am, so copying you, how could I be? The offending party here, house Chamgar is."`
	"CN-9663" `	"Changed your name for this mockery, you could have. Know of your house's grudge against us, I do," he replies.`
	"CN-9664" `	"Absurd, childish, that is. The one to start mocking me, you were," she says. "Captain <last>, urge you to make haste for Ahr, I must. Put up with this buffoon for much longer, I cannot."`
	"CN-9665" `	Lady Plubat closes the door to her room again, and you convince house Chamgar's representative to also go back to his room. You return to your cockpit, hoping that's the last of that.`
	"CN-9666" `A few minutes after the final representative leaves your ship, you receive your payment of 4,500,000 credits. It comes with a message from the royal family, with the symbols of all Arach houses on it. You recognize most from advertisements or offices on some planets, but it's your first time seeing the center one. You imagine it's the emblem of the royal family.`
	"CN-9667" `	"Greetings, Captain <last>. As the hosts of the Council of Ahr, thank you for your assistance we do. Although certain we are that, to you, appear mundane such kinds of jobs can, difficult, at times it is, to arrange for appropriate transportation for our compatriots from all great houses, so know that deeply grateful for your cooperation, House Oberegt is."`
	"CN-9668" `You notice a Kimek anxiously glancing at the docks from the front of an office building. Once he notices you, he scurries closer. "Say, Captain, willing to do me a service, are you? Transport off-world, I need."`
	"CN-9669" `	"Where do you want to go?"`
	"CN-9670" `	"I'm not looking for transport jobs right now, sorry."`
	"CN-9671" `	"A prestigious research group from Second Cerulean, I represent, and looking to expand our deep-sea expeditions, we are. For that, just settled the acquisition of five new submarines, my superiors have," he says. "To pick them up from <planet>, I was selected, so transported there, I must be. Permitted to pay you <payment> for the service, I am."`
	"CN-9672" `	"Alright, I'll show you to my ship."`
	"CN-9673" `	"Why weren't they built on Second Cerulean in the first place?"`
	"CN-9674" `	"No facilities for such construction, Second Cerulean has," he explains. "Remain mostly untouched, the planet must. Build more than simple research stations on it, we cannot. But in need of sturdier subs, we are, so held a competition to determine what company was to build them, my group did. In my opinion, honestly, not needed such a process was. Obvious that House Mallob would win, it was. Unrivaled in hull integrity, they are."`
	"CN-9675" `	"I see. Well, I'd love to help you. Let me show you to my ship."`
	"CN-9676" `	"What's so special about this planet that you can't do it there? One shipyard shouldn't be too invasive."`
	"CN-9677" `	"Well, I wish you luck, but I'm not headed that way, sorry."`
	"CN-9678" `	He thinks for a while, formulating a response. "Centuries ago, when built there, our outpost was, being worried that trouble the delicate, unique food chains there, further expansion would, prohibited all from settling, and us from constructing any more than the necessary structures, the government did. Enough data, we've gathered, that managed to convince them to allow us some extra exploration vessels, we have. More invasive, the studies with them will be, but enough about the fauna and flora, we now know, that avoid any major complications, we can."`
	"CN-9679" `	"Seems like a lot of bureaucracy just for some research. Anyway, I'd be glad to help, let's head to my ship."`
	"CN-9680" `	"If the planet's native life is all underwater, how would a shipyard pose any risk? It's not like you'd build it underwater."`
	"CN-9681" `	"That sounds overly complicated. I wish you luck in getting it all set, but I'm not headed there, so I can't help you."`
	"CN-9682" `	Like a bush in the wind, his body shivers wildly at what you said. "No, built underwater, nothing would be. Obvious that is. But, still, make the rules, I do not, Captain. Simply following them, I am."`
	"CN-9683" `	"Well, I'm not really interested in this, sorry."`
	"CN-9684" `	"Very good. Thank you, Captain. Called Apri'ie, and a member of the Pale Waters research center, I am. A wonderful trip, may we have." You bring him to your ship and help him settle what little luggage he has in his room.`
	"CN-9685" `Apri'ie has you land by one of House Mallob's offices, which looks like a mix of a skyscraper and a warehouse, and hands you <payment>.`
	"CN-9686" `	"Thank you for the assistance, Captain <last>. Meet with House Mallob's executives, I must, but if to continue helping, you wish, meet you in the spaceport, I will. The proper transportation of the submarines, the next step is, so if interested, you are, free up space for them, you must." He pauses, as if counting the total weight. "About 60 tons, they should take up. At any rate, talk more in detail in the spaceport, we may." He picks up his belongings and heads for the office, disappearing into the building.`
	"CN-9687" `After spending some time in the spaceport, you begin to ask around for Apri'ie and are directed to a small office of House Mallob. There, a manager briefly looks into their systems and informs you that Apri'ie hasn't left his meeting yet, and so you take a seat in the spaceport, occasionally getting up to check back at the entrance of the office he entered. After some hours, you finally see him exit, accompanied by a Saryd speaking on a communication device as they glance at a data pad.`
	"CN-9688" `	"Captain <last>! Glad that you are interested in assisting us further, I am. Prepared to have the submarines loaded into your cargo hold, are you?" Apri'ie asks. "Ready to conduct some final stress tests, colleagues of mine on <planet> are."`
	"CN-9689" `	"Sure thing, I've set aside the space for them."`
	"CN-9690" `	"What sort of testing are you going to do?"`
	"CN-9691" `	"Capable of enduring rapid shifts in pressure, the subs must be, so take quick, deep dives in the oceans of <planet>, and then resurface just as quickly, they will," he says. "Performed their own tests, House Mallob has, so most assuredly ready to go, the vessels are, but just as a formality, perform these tests, we must."`
	"CN-9692" `	"I see. Well, I'm ready to go, so you can have the submarines brought to my ship."`
	"CN-9693" `	"Why not just do those tests on Second Cerulean right away?"`
	"CN-9694" `	"Upsetting or startling the local fauna, as well as any structural damage, we wish to avoid, so wait until after the tests, we will, before deploying them in that planet's waters."`
	"CN-9695" `	"Let's get on with it then. My ship is ready to carry the subs."`
	"CN-9696" `	"Structural damage?"`
	"CN-9697" `	He stares at you blankly for a moment. "Delicately arranged, the glaciers there are. Resting on them, some of our monitoring equipment is. Avoid any damage to them caused by an unforeseen malfunction, we must."`
	"CN-9698" `	The Saryd issues a command on the data pad and turns off the communication device and accompanies you and Apri'ie to your ship as the cargo is loaded.`
	"CN-9699" `	There are five submarines in total, strapped to large, sturdy sleds, which are slowly pushed up the ramp to your cargo hold. The subs themselves are somewhat oval in shape but flat on the top and bottom, with retractable mechanical arms on their sides. After the last sub is safely in your cargo hold, Apri'ie heads into your ship and you set a route for <destination>.`
	"CN-9700" `As the workers unload the submarines from your cargo, Apri'ie approaches you, handing you <payment>. "Oversee the stress test I must, so meet you in the spaceport again, I will. If interested in seeing the test you are, however, come with me, you may."`
	"CN-9701" `	"Sure, why not? Probably beats waiting around and checking shops over and over."`
	"CN-9702" `	"Thanks for the invitation, but I'm not really interested."`
	"CN-9703" `	After all the submarines are out of your cargo hold, they're placed atop trucks with heavy tracks instead of wheels. You and Apri'ie board one of the trucks and begin a trip down to the shore below, reaching a small commercial port with a large set of docks. Once there, Apri'ie introduces you to some of his colleagues who are already waiting to begin the tests. The subs are activated before they are off the trucks, and some of the Kimek begin to test basic functions.`
	"CN-9704" `	Once they're all in the water, everyone boards a sturdy barge which follows the submarines several kilometers off the coast until you can no longer see the shore. At this point they stop, and one of the submarines submerges, resurfacing in about twenty minutes. The Kimek make sure the sub suffered no damage, and proceed to test the other ones. After each one has made the trip to the bottom and back several times, the submarines and the barge head back to the docks.`
	"CN-9705" `	The subs are once again put on the trucks, and you begin the trip back to the spaceport city. Once you've arrived, Apri'ie's colleagues ask him to come with them to discuss something in private, and he tells you he will meet you back on the spaceport.`
	"CN-9706" `	"Then in the spaceport, meet you I will," he says. After all the submarines are out of your cargo hold, they're placed atop large truck-like vehicles, but with the wheels in a system of continuous tracks. Apri'ie boards one of the trucks, and they start making their way down to the shore below. From there, they follow the water out of the fjord to someplace where the submarines can dive deeper.`
	"CN-9707" `Apri'ie comes to the spaceport followed by one of his colleagues. "Have to perform one more test, we will, Captain. To assess the subs' repair abilities in hazardous environments, Pale Waters wants, so a quick stop at <destination>, we must make."`
	"CN-9708" `	"Alright, we'll head there next then."`
	"CN-9709" `	"Assess their 'repair' abilities? What do you mean?"`
	"CN-9710" `	"Equipped with welders, the arms of the submarines are, so that if greatly damaged deep underwater, one of them is, repaired by the others, it can be," he explains. "Unstable tectonics, <planet> has, so a test repair during one of the nightly tremors, we will conduct. That way, assess their abilities without bothering Second Cerulean's fauna, we can."`
	"CN-9711" `	"Sounds like you thought of everything for these subs. Let's head there next then."`
	"CN-9712" `	"Why do you need to test under such conditions? Does Second Cerulean have trouble with tectonics too?"`
	"CN-9713" `	"No, no. But, preparing for any eventuality, we are," he answers. "Should the planet's plates grow unstable, or some other troubling factor come up, prepared for it, the subs must be."`
	"CN-9714" `	His colleague speaks up. "Headed to <planet>, another team from the research center has. Return to Second Cerulean with the data we have collected, I and the others will. Prepared the subs for your cargo, we already have."`
	"CN-9715" `	You follow him back to your ship and see that the submarines are ready on the giant sleds again. After they're brought into your hold, Apri'ie's colleagues say goodbye to him, and he enters your ship once more.`
	"CN-9716" `Apri'ie instructs you to head to some hangars at a large port, where a team is waiting for the repair test. He hands you 130,000 credits when you land, and goes to check with the workers unloading the submarines.`
	"CN-9717" `	They are all taken from your cargo and swiftly put in the water as the team of Kimek boards a large ship that you guess is an old tanker. This ship prepares to follow the subs to the testing area, along with another smaller, newer ship with a thick crane on the front. Apri'ie approaches you before he boards the tanker, asking, "Come with us for the test, would you like, Captain? Take a while, it might. Not expected until after nightfall, the next tremors are."`
	"CN-9718" `	"If it's alright, yeah. Could be interesting."`
	"CN-9719" `	"I'll pass. I need some time to rest after the trip here."`
	"CN-9720" `	You head up the ramp to the ship, and after a few minutes it sets off, following the submarines controlled remotely by the Kimek team. Exploring the tanker, you find an odd pile of what looks like broken up ship parts, secured as cargo on the back. The pieces are welded together into a shape similar to the cockpit of one of the smaller Heliarch ships, though it has several dents, as if hit by some explosives. Apri'ie notices you looking at it and comes to explain that it's the "prop" on which they'll test the repair functions.`
	"CN-9721" `	Once the tanker comes to a stop, the smaller ship's crane grabs the prop and slowly maneuvers it away from the tanker before lowering it into the water and letting it sink. The submarines follow the prop as it goes down, until it comes to a stop after a few minutes.`
	"CN-9722" `	The Kimek operators then proceed to take shifts at their computers as everyone waits for a tremor to begin. After the moon is high in the sky, you notice odd shifts on the waves and trembling on the boats, with which the Kimek start their repair work. Once they're done, and after the tremors stop, the subs slowly bring the prop back up, where the crane places it on the tanker again.`
	"CN-9723" `	"Let's see..." Apri'ie heads to the prop to check on the welded parts. "Yes, very good. Performed well, the welder arms have. Good for deployment, they should be." The submarines go ahead once again, lighting the way back to the port as the ships follow them until docking.`
	"CN-9724" `	He heads to the tanker, and the ships set off, following the submarines. You walk for a while by the spaceport, stopping at a restaurant to have a Saryd pastry dish. You return to the port at sunset and wait until you finally spot the submarines' lights on the horizon heading toward the shore.`
	"CN-9725" `	"Worked perfectly, the welders have. Ready for deployment, the subs should be," Apri'ie tells you as he steps off of the tanker.`
	"CN-9726" `	The subs are once again placed atop the sleds and brought into your ship. Apri'ie thanks the Kimek team for handling the subs and heads back into your ship, saying, "Time for their final trip, it is. Bring the vessels and I to <destination>, you may."`
	"CN-9727" `The local workers carefully unload the submarines off your ship one at a time, bringing them to the icy waters nearby, where they will dive to perform deep sea explorations on the local fauna.`
	"CN-9728" `	Once they're done, Apri'ie invites you to enter the research facility, just a few kilometers away from the spaceport tower, with hangars of its own for your ship. There you're met by a committee of sorts; a handful of the local scientists greet the two of you, and thank you for helping with transporting the subs. "Having trouble reaching deeper sections of the ocean, our older probes were, so able to analyze a multitude of new species, with these new subs we hope to be," one of them tells you.`
	"CN-9729" `	When they're done, they hand you <payment>, and Apri'ie follows you to your ship. "Thankful for you putting up with all the last-minute detours I am, Captain. Safe travels, may you have." He does a short gesture as a form of goodbye: you put your forearm on the ground, and he places one of his legs over it. Once you're done, he heads back to the research center.`
	"CN-9730" `As you exit your ship and start heading to the spaceport, you hear a rushed galloping getting closer. As you turn you see a Saryd Heliarch coming to you, gesturing for you to wait. She slows down once she sees you're obliging, and slowly walks to you while glancing at your ship.`
	"CN-9731" `	"Apologize for cutting you off, I must, Captain <last>, but in need of extended transport services, I am," she says. "Sedlitaris Quatcid, my name is, and a Heliarch tribune, I am. Brought to <destination>, I must be. A petition to the council, I am to make."`
	"CN-9732" `	"A 'petition'? What do you mean?"`
	"CN-9733" `	"I don't think you'd need some 'extended' service just for that."`
	"CN-9734" `	"Sorry, I'm not taking any more passengers right now."`
	"CN-9735" `	"Nearly a thousand years ago, leading an expeditionary fleet to outside of the Coalition, an ancestor of mine was," she explains. "Mimodum, his name was, and after having risen the ranks and lifted our family from poorer conditions, chosen to lead the expedition he was. Only, return, he did not. To find out what happened, I wish. Looking for you, I was, as after my request is approved, need a transport to bring me to planets he visited, I will."`
	"CN-9736" `	"I'd be glad to help you find out what happened. Let me show you to your bunk."`
	"CN-9737" `	"Couldn't you just have gone on your own, or paid someone to bring you there if you don't have a ship?"`
	"CN-9738" `	"Actually, I'm not going to be leaving Coalition space anytime soon. Sorry."`
	"CN-9739" `	She shakes her head. "Forbidden from leaving just like that, anyone is, and steal a jump drive for it, I'd need to. Obviously illegal, that is. Allowed to head out, only Heliarchs who have received permission from the council can. Finally time to hear my request again, they have, so go to <planet>, I must."`
	"CN-9740" `	"Well, let's not keep them waiting then. Let me show you to your bunk."`
	"CN-9741" `	"I hope things work out for you, but I'm not heading out of the Coalition anytime soon. Sorry."`
	"CN-9742" `	"Great! I promise you, very well paid you will be, once finished. For the moment, pay you <payment> I shall, when we arrive at the ring."`
	"CN-9743" `	You bring her inside your ship, and set a route to <destination>.`
	"CN-9744" `Sedlitaris gives you your payment of <payment> before you open your hatch for her to leave. "Take a few hours, this might, so wait for me in the spaceport, you can. Know the layout well, I do, so find you without issue, I will."`
	"CN-9745" `	As you open your hatch to see her leave, you're faced with a Kimek Heliarch waiting for the two of you, startling Sedlitaris as she sees him.`
	"CN-9746" `	"Made it clear, have I not, that cease your stubborn attempts, you should, tribune?" he asks. "Too precious, the consuls' time is. Keep wasting it in telling you off, they cannot."`
	"CN-9747" `	Sedlitaris brings a hand to her hair as she looks down. She opens her mouth, but cuts whatever she had to say at her throat. Instead, she goes down the ramp and leaves quickly for some section of the ringworld, ignoring the Kimek's protests. He sighs and approaches you. "Roped you into her exploration plan has she, Captain? An outsider with a jump drive, you are, so of course drawn to you, she would be, that girl..."`
	"CN-9748" `	"Are you two colleagues?"`
	"CN-9749" `	"What was that about her being stubborn?"`
	"CN-9750" `	"Kicharri, I am. For many decades, the arbiter supervising Sedlitaris' work, I have been. A bright girl. Produced many excellent theoretical models of the outside, she has, but in recent years, obsessed with leaving on an official expedition, she became. Denied her nearly a dozen times, the consuls have, but get the hint, she won't." He rapidly taps the ground with his legs, as if the ground was hot to the touch. "Helped her set up this specific 'petition,' I have. Asked the council to be extra strict and definitive this time, I did. Contracted you for a longer trip, I assume she has, but be allowed to leave, she will not."`
	"CN-9751" `	He wishes you a good day, and leaves to an office opposite to the spaceport.`
	"CN-9752" `When you don't see Sedlitaris in the spaceport, you look for a spot to sit and wait for her, and notice a set of seats made for the Quarg, still around to this day. You take one that you assume was meant for a Quarg child, standing lower than the others, and wait. Captains and workers that pass by give you all sorts of looks, and after a few minutes even some Heliarch agents are gawking at you, discussing among themselves. Just as you decide you should get up and sit somewhere else, you look to see Sedlitaris coming into the spaceport.`
	"CN-9753" `	"A short wait, wasn't it?" she comments once you're close. "Care to hear my case, the consuls didn't, just told me that to leave whenever I wish, I may. 'If I can,' they said, as provide me a jump drive, they won't, but that's where you come in."`
	"CN-9754" `	"I certainly didn't wait around for long. So, where are we heading?"`
	"CN-9755" `	"Didn't care to hear your case? What do you mean?"`
	"CN-9756" `	"According to protocol, present valid reasoning for their expedition, and a thorough travel plan, aspiring inspectors must. This time, taken every legal detail into account, I had, in preparation for the meeting, but once I entered, barely time to greet them, they gave me." She explains. "Said that thought it over, they had, and willing to oblige, they were, so just sign a few documents, I did, and now officially an inspector, I am."`
	"CN-9757" `	"I take it inspector is what you call explorers?"`
	"CN-9758" `	"Good to hear they had a change of heart. So, where are we heading?"`
	"CN-9759" `	"No mere explorers, we are," she begins. "A rank granted with utmost respect to the Coalition's bravest, those unafraid to venture out into the void, to chart the unknown, it is. Date back thousands of years, the title does. First used by early Saryds, when set out to explore beyond the home system, they had, and then adopted by the Heliarchs, it was. Remain in use to this day, the term does," she says in excitement, pausing with a smile as if considering that she herself is one such "inspector" now.`
	"CN-9760" `	"So, will it be you paying me for the job, or is that the consuls now since they've officially approved this?"`
	"CN-9761" `	"You seem eager to get started. So, where are we heading?"`
	"CN-9762" `	"Approval for us to leave, they gave me, but provide any further assistance - be that a jump drive, or funding - they won't," she explains. "Saved up well over the past few years, I have, so once done we are, pay you several million credits, I shall. But, who knows, maybe if exciting enough, our findings out there are, convinced to give you a bonus, the consuls might be," she smiles.`
	"CN-9763" `	"Ready to go outside, we are not. Not for the purpose of finding out about the last expedition, at least. A tool from House Idriss, we need, if to trace my ancestor's steps, we are. To <destination>, we must go."`
	"CN-9764" `	As she's about to continue, your conversation is cut short by a Kimek rushing toward you two, shouting frantically. Once he's closer, you recognize him as Arbiter Kicharri from earlier, and Sedlitaris tries to calm him down while he's catching his breath. "Professor, if about my request this is, already met with the council, I have. Approved it-"`
	"CN-9765" `	"Know that, I do! Exactly what I'm furious about, that is!" He shouts. "Asked them to give you a definitive answer, I had, but not this kind of definitive! Listen, permission or not, safe to leave, it is not. Know that, you do." He looks at her for a few moments, then to you. "Captain, as her superior, greatly appreciate your intent to help Sedlitaris, I do, but too brash about this, she has been. Take her out of our space, you must not."`
	"CN-9766" `	He looks at her again, as if expecting some response. When no response comes, he turns away slowly, saying, "Waste not, your life on this," and walks away. Sedlitaris sighs once he turns a corridor and says she's ready for the trip.`
	"CN-9767" `	"Hold on, what did he mean by it not being safe to leave? I thought you had permission."`
	"CN-9768" `	"Alright, let's head back to the ship."`
	"CN-9769" `	"I do. Know what he meant, I also do not," she says, looking back to the corner Kicharri turned. "Approving of my wish for this trip, he never was. Some time to calm down, he needs. For now, back to your ship, we should go."`
	"CN-9770" `	"Alright, let's go."`
	"CN-9771" `	"I'm not sure I'm comfortable going after that."`
	"CN-9772" `	She steps back, seemingly shocked at your change of mind. "What? Captain, a superstitious Kimek, the arbiter is. Pay no mind to that rant, you should. Assure you I do, fine we will be."`
	"CN-9773" `	"I'm sorry, but I won't help you anymore."`
	"CN-9774" `	"I better not regret this. Let's head to the ship."`
	"CN-9775" `	Sedlitaris doesn't say anything, but makes no effort to hide her frustration. She looks to where Kicharri headed, and storms off after him.`
	"CN-9776" `	You find five Heliarchs waiting by your ship, who Sedlitaris introduces as representatives of the council, and who must be present when House Idriss provides the piece of equipment she wants. You show her and the others to their bunks and prepare for the trip.`
	"CN-9777" `The Heliarch council representatives guide you far from the planet's equator to a region close to a snowy mountain, and tell you to land on top of a cube-shaped plateau. Dozens of searchlights are dotted along the edges, lighting the ground below, while a warehouse complex sits at the center of the plateau top. As you're approaching the plateau, your ship's sensors alert you to incoming vessels; you look at your radar to see a Saryd Sojourner, followed by three Travelers, getting closer to your ship. They appear unarmed, but as you land on the plateau and they follow you down, defensive turrets on the edges of the complex remain locked onto them.`
	"CN-9778" `	Once the Sojourner lands, a Saryd comes down the ramp and heads to your ship. Sedlitaris sighs and leaves to meet him, followed by the representatives of the Heliarch council. Once you're all out of your ship, you see the Saryd has been stopped by a trio of Arach guards, clad in winter uniforms and blocking his path. "Told mother or father about this, have you?" he shouts at Sedlitaris as she walks closer. "Because important enough to be told, I apparently am not. That out to die you were, told I was by some Kimek arbiter that met, I never had!"`
	"CN-9779" `	"Repilor, a work trip, this is. Away for long, I won't be, so wish to trouble you all with the news, I didn't," she responds.`
	"CN-9780" `	"Trouble us? In truth, know that wrong, you are, but face telling father that you're throwing your life away, you couldn't!"`
	"CN-9781" `	He tries to push his way to her, but the guards stop him before he can make much progress. One of the Heliarch representatives gets closer, saying, "A restricted area, this is. Invading government property, you are, so suggest that you leave immediately, I do."`
	"CN-9782" `	"Restricted? What about the outside? Also restricted, is it not? Much more dangerous? Fine with sending my sister there, you seem," Repilor counters, and the Heliarch looks away after a moment. "If bothering the consuls so much, she was, just fired, she should've been!" He then looks at you, and continues, "And the human? Your transport out of here, I imagine? Or maybe the one who put these ideas in your head, they are?"`
	"CN-9783" `	"I've just been hired to transport her."`
	"CN-9784" `	"What's so wrong about her wanting to explore outside the Coalition?"`
	"CN-9785" `	"Wait, what did you say about the outside being dangerous?"`
	"CN-9786" `	The Saryd looks at you, puzzled. Then, as if realizing something, he turns to Sedlitaris. "Told the human, you haven't?"`
	"CN-9787" `	"Enough that is, Repilor. Trespassing on a restricted area, you are. Escort him to his ship," she tells the guards, and after some struggle on Repilor's part, the Arachi manage to push him back inside the Sojourner. "Ignore that you should, Captain. Always... difficult, my brother was. Too stubborn to realize when to stop, and easy to impress with folk tales of the outside."`
	"CN-9788" `	"If you say so. Should I wait in my ship until you all are done here?"`
	"CN-9789" `	"Folk tales or not, I'm not really willing to find out after that. He didn't seem to be lying."`
	"CN-9790" `	"What?" she exclaims. "Please Captain, fall for my brother's little rant, you cannot. Finally permission to leave, I have!"`
	"CN-9791" `	"Alright, alright. But I hope I don't regret this."`
	"CN-9792" `	"I'm sorry. Whatever it is he was afraid of, I'm not willing to risk it."`
	"CN-9793" `	"You won't." She says, heading to you and holding your hands with hers, as if in thanks. "Promise you I do, fine we will be, Captain."`
	"CN-9794" `	You hear her stomping her hoofs on the ground as you head back to your ship, and see her and the Heliarch council representatives arguing with one another as you close your hatch. When you're back on the spaceport landing area, a Sojourner lands next to your ship, and Repilor, the Saryd from earlier, comes out.`
	"CN-9795" `	"Forgive me for being rude earlier, you must," he says as he greets you. "Thought I had, that talked my sister into this you did. That filled her head with more grandiose tales of the outside, you must have." He sighs. "Thank you, Captain. Hate you now, my sister must, but the right thing, you did.`
	"CN-9796" `	"That no inspector in the last 6000 years has ever returned from their expedition, the truth is, so afraid you were leading my sister to her death, I was. Better for the both of you, this is." He gives you a few seconds to process, then continues. "Please, hold it against her, I ask that you do not. Certain I am that intending you no harm, she was. It's just... trying to leave for so long, she has been, that afraid of telling you the whole truth, I imagine she was." He nods lightly in a bow, and heads back to his ship.`
	"CN-9797" `	"Awaiting 'explorers,' nothing but an unknown, certain doom is. Wish for that to be my sister's fate, I do not," he answers.`
	"CN-9798" `	"Captain <last> has nothing to do with it. Simply agreed to help me, they have, no different from the jobs you take, this is." Sedlitaris says.`
	"CN-9799" `	"A job, this is not, but a trek bound to end in tragedy." He thinks for a few seconds, looking at the Saryd ships that landed on the plateau. "Permission to leave, you have, but obligated to do so, you aren't. Quit, you still can. Leave the ranks, you could, and work with me. Give you my own ship, I will. Like that, would you not? To fly a ship of your own again?"`
	"CN-9800" `	"Finally allowed to leave, I am. Let go of this opportunity I won't, Repilor. Back in a few weeks, I'll be, lecture me all you want then, you can."`
	"CN-9801" `	He stares her down for a while, bringing a hand to his face to wipe some tears forming on his eyes. "Wiser than this, the elder sibling should've been." He turns around and heads back to the Sojourner, which departs along with the three Travelers.`
	"CN-9802" `	The representatives urge you and Sedlitaris to follow them into the complex, making your way past the walls and fences, and into one of the larger warehouses. Inside, large shelves stacked to the ceiling surround a hexagonal hole in the middle, closed off by metal bars and a shut gate. You're told it's an elevator and is bringing up the piece of equipment Sedlitaris requires.`
	"CN-9803" `	"Deeply sorry for that scandal you witnessed, I am, Captain," she says while you wait. "Imagined, I hadn't, that follow us here, my brother would."`
	"CN-9804" `	"It's alright. It shows he cares a lot about you."`
	"CN-9805" `	"Wasn't he trespassing here? Why was he even allowed to do all of that?"`
	"CN-9806" `	"What was he so worried about? Did something happen to make him afraid of you leaving?"`
	"CN-9807" `	She thinks for a bit, then says, "Prohibited to leave, both civilians and regular Heliarchs are. Only agents with permission from the council - inspectors like myself - may do it. A simple measure to help protect our limited jump drives, it is, but birthed something of a taboo among the populace, that law has."`
	"CN-9808" `	She chuckles. "Probably because agree with him, the guards do. Seen Arbiter Kicharri's reaction, you did. Not very supportive of this expedition, most within the ranks are."`
	"CN-9809" `	"I suppose so. Just, wish that show it in less... brash ways, he would."`
	"CN-9810" `	The elevator arrives and brings up an Arachi pair carrying a tall, antenna-like pylon, covered in insulating wires that spiral around it. The Arachi bring the machine out of the elevator and present some documents for the Heliarch representatives, who take turns reading and signing them. At the end, Sedlitaris signs as well, and the Arachi bring the pylon to your ship.`
	"CN-9811" `	Once everything's ready, the Heliarch representatives ask you to bring them to the spaceport city. They are quick to leave your ship once you land and do not bother to say goodbye to either you or Sedlitaris, instead just disappearing into a Heliarch building.`
	"CN-9812" `	"Well, all set to leave now, we are," Sedlitaris says. "Ready to leave for our first stop, are you, Captain?"`
	"CN-9813" `	"Of course. Where are we headed?"`
	"CN-9814" `	"Can you tell me what that machine is? How is it going to help?"`
	"CN-9815" `	"A decryption pylon, it is. Developed to keep our data safe, they were," she explains. "Generate a unique encryption pattern, each expedition would, so that find important information about them, outside forces couldn't. Calibrated to the pattern of my ancestor's expedition, this one is."`
	"CN-9816" `	She asks to see your galaxy map, and compares the data with what's recorded in the pylon. After comparing what systems match for a few minutes, she points you to <destination>. "The first stop of every expedition, that world was. Kept there, a collection of log entries are, detailing the plans each leader had for their own expedition. Do you know if found this world, humans have, Captain?" You explain to her that <planet> is home to a small human town, but that you haven't heard of alien findings there. "Hope that found and picked it over, humans haven't. Much easier, it would be, if the precise location the fleet was headed to, we knew. Have to travel hundreds of systems in search of their stops, and later piece them together in order, we would not."`
	"CN-9817" `	You help her bring the pylon into her room and set course for <planet>.`
	"CN-9818" `Coming down to <origin>, Sedlitaris checks for the coordinates where the ancient Saryd stop is, passing the data to your ship's systems. It brings you to a mesa on the desert, with a wide, ravine-like hole on top. You land close to a small opening on the mesa walls leading into the ravine and follow Sedlitaris into it, helping her bring the pylon inside. About halfway to the end, she points to another hole in the walls. "Past there, the pylons of previous expeditions should be. Find the one Mimodum left here, we must. A physical connection with the one we brought, for this first one we'll need. 'Wake up' the other ones his expedition left, it will, and enough battery for easier access to the data in those, they should have."`
	"CN-9819" `	She carries the pylon inside as you light the way. After some short minutes inside the tunnel dug into the mesa walls, you reach the end: a room carefully carved out, with ten objects similar to the pylon Sedlitaris carried there, though four are of very different design, being closer to a beige, blocky obelisk. She puts down the pylon, and asks that you shine a light on it so that she can configure it. Then, she begins to tinker with some wires connected to a panel on the lower half of the pylon. "To determine which one of these is the most recent, send a signal in its frequency, I will."`
	"CN-9820" `	"Was all this process set up so the Quarg couldn't get your logs, if they found them?"`
	"CN-9821" `	"What's with all the caving involved in getting to these pylons?"`
	"CN-9822" `	"Understand your frustration, I do," she says. "After explored outside with jump drives, the first Saryds to leave the Coalition had, attempted to colonize a few worlds they found, they did. Failures due to the great distance to Saryd space, and difficulty in getting supplies, they were. Because of that, once leaving initial expedition logs in this world, we began, bothered to create proper infrastructure, my predecessors didn't." She thinks for a while, then continues, "Although, help make it less likely for others to find it, the poor entrance might."`
	"CN-9823" `	"No, employed this method before they ever came in conflict with the Quarg, the ancient Saryds did," she explains. "Actually, the ones who suggested it in the first place, the Quarg were. Worlds apart, the programs used before and after the War of Independence are, but kept in place, the overall practice was."`
	"CN-9824" `	Once she's done with the wires, she pushes a button and a humming beep comes from one of the machines with the same, spiraling design. "That one, it is," she says, and asks that you help her move her pylon close to the one that emitted the sound. She connects the two with cables by the base of each pylon; the older pylon clicks on after a moment, letting out several beeps in a short chant. "Enough energy to transfer its data now, it should have."`
	"CN-9825" `	A few seconds pass, and another hum comes. She looks at a small screen on the panel, and confirms that the data's all safe. "Copy the data from expeditions prior to their pylon here, the sixth did, so saved us some time, they have. Play their recorded log via my translation device, I shall." She disconnects the two pylons from one another, and inputs a few commands on the panel. After a short pause, an audio message begins playing, and is picked up and translated by the box hanging from Sedlitaris' neck.`
	"CN-9826" `	"Log started, sixth expedition to the outside. Arbiter Mimodum, this is, leading the sixth. Using these pylons, keep track of our major stops, we shall. To push out further than what is recorded in our previous maps, if possible, the mission directive is. Wish to gather data on how safe the outside systems are, I do. Split the fleet in half, I have. To head straight east, the four Punishers of the split group are. After that, rendezvous with us as we come down from the north, they will. Regarding the Punishers currently under my command, headed to Distant Home, we are. Evaluate how the planet has developed, we shall, to determine if sustainable, a base or colony on the planet is. Set a pylon there with our findings, we shall."`
	"CN-9827" `	The recording ends, and Sedlitaris picks up the pylon again, preparing to carry it back out of the caves. "Know our next destination, we now do," she says.`
	"CN-9828" `	"Do you have any idea where 'Distant Home' is?"`
	"CN-9829" `	"What did he mean by 'if possible'? Was something stopping them from exploring past a point?"`
	"CN-9830" `	"Stopping them?" She takes a long pause, eyes locked onto the pylon. "Wonder that, I also do. Perhaps encountered some complication, they had. Learn more from other log entries, I'm sure we will."`
	"CN-9831" `	"Our first attempt at colonizing an outside world, it was. Somewhere northwest of here, it should be, but consult your ship's records for the exact coordinates, we'll need to."`
	"CN-9832" `	You two make your way out of the cave, returning to the ravine, and from there head to your ship. Sedlitaris asks for your map and compares the coordinates with the data from the pylon again, finding that <destination> is what the recording referred to as Distant Home. She heads to her room, and you set <planet> as your destination.`
	"CN-9833" `As you pass through the first clouds of <origin>, Sedlitaris starts working on the pylon, getting a faint beep moments after she's done. "Further south, this world's pylon is." You fly your ship southward, and she asks that you stop halfway to the pole. She inputs commands again, and another beep comes. "Passed it, we have. Determine its exact position, we must. Little battery for these countersignals, the pylons have." You fly northeast, and then straight west, with her emitting a signal each time your ship stops.`
	"CN-9834" `	After you've triangulated the pylon's coordinates, you fly down to a glacier and land on a spot that looks stable enough to handle the weight of your ship. Sedlitaris says the pylon must have gotten covered in the ice due to glacial melting and refreezing, though that doesn't seem to have damaged its systems; she accesses the data remotely after tinkering with the pylon in your ship for a while.`
	"CN-9835" `	Once it's done, she plays the log recording the expedition had for this planet: "Log started. Developing as expected, this world is, and apparently still untouched, it remains. Too cold for non-Saryd residents, it is, but with some terraforming efforts, a comfortable enough base for Kimek and Arachi agents alike, it could be. The planet aside, noted a great deal more hyperlane connections, we have. Dependent on them, this fleet is not, but differ greatly from previous records, current ones do, as if scrambled and then rearranged, they were. Heading to Ancient Light next, we are. Check on the ruins and dragons there, we must."`
	"CN-9836" `	The recording ends, and Sedlitaris starts comparing the data she got with the map on your ship. "Right, he was. At some point after the fifth expedition, and before the sixth, altered, this region's hyperlane network was."`
	"CN-9837" `	"Any idea how that happened?"`
	"CN-9838" `	"I take it that 'Ancient Light' is where we're going next?"`
	"CN-9839" `	"Vital to our communications network, the hyperlanes are. The most advanced group on that field, House Bebliss is, but learned of means to tamper with hyperlanes, even they haven't." She pauses, looking to the nearby systems bordering the Coalition. "No link to our space, there is, before or after the change. If a natural phenomenon, the scrambling of links is, very unlucky, we were."`
	"CN-9840" `	"Well, at least we know where to go next. Can you match coordinates with my map to find where 'Ancient Light' is?"`
	"CN-9841" `	"And if it's not natural?"`
	"CN-9842" `	She stays quiet for a minute, not taking her eyes off the map. "Told the ancient Saryds of a group, the Quarg did. 'Drak,' I think they called them. Said that knit together the paths between star systems, they had. Maybe their doing, the scrambling was."`
	"CN-9843" `	She compares the coordinates for Ancient Light with your map, and finds <destination>. You tell her you'll set course for <planet>, and she heads back to her room.`
	"CN-9844" `Sedlitaris starts triangulating to find the next pylon again, and brings you to a tall mountain where some of the local dragons appear to have made some form of nest or breeding ground. You do your best to avoid them as you fly around the mountain, and Sedlitaris continues to send signals to find the pylon.`
	"CN-9845" `	"Inside the mountain, it could be. From there, the countersignals are coming." She stops for a few minutes and looks at the view of the mountain on your monitors. She tries again, and asks that you get closer. When you're finishing yet another lap, she asks that you stop your ship, keeping it steady in the air. "Zoom your cameras here, could you, Captain?" she asks, pointing to the middle of a monitor. You zoom in and see a circle of large rocks, surrounded by dragon nests. Atop the rocks are some patches of foliage, and in the middle lies a small, dark, tower-like structure, stuck in the rocks by one end. After looking at it for a few seconds, you both realize it's an upside-down pylon. "Taken it as some form of token, the dragons must have," Sedlitaris says. "Hopes of retrieving some of the pylons physically, I had, but prefer to dig out the glacier for the previous one than test my luck against the dragons, I do. Unlock this one's data remotely, I will."`
	"CN-9846" `	A dragon perches on your ship as she begins the transfer. It tries to bite down on the engines, but you start moving your ship again to shake it off. You avoid other dragons as they fly by your ship until the download is complete, and head straight for the spaceport city.`
	"CN-9847" `	Once your ship has safely landed at the hangars, Sedlitaris plays the audio log: "Log started. Scoured the planet with our searches, we have, but no trace of the previously visited ruins, or any other sign of the group that lived here, we found. Assured me that all our ships' navigation systems are working properly, the engineers have, but at the coordinates where they should be, the ruins are not, as if they had never been there. A confusing disappointment, this was, but continue with the mission, we must. Heading far north, to Summit, we are. The last point before regrouping with the split group, it will be."`
	"CN-9848" `	As the recording ends, Sedlitaris looks at you confused. "An intelligent species once lived on this planet. What findings Mimodum would have on them, I wondered, but found nothing, he did? Simply vanish out of nowhere, ruins cannot."`
	"CN-9849" `	"How do you know about that species?"`
	"CN-9850" `	"What was in the ruins before they disappeared?"`
	"CN-9851" `	"Found the ruins millennia ago, the first Saryds to come to the outside did. Recovered some artifacts, they also had, complex tools, such as very large, personal propelling devices, with dedicated storage space. Kept in some museums back in Saros, they are."`
	"CN-9852" `	"Did they ever find any member of that species?"`
	"CN-9853" `	"They couldn't find out anything more? Just some jetpacks with pockets?"`
	"CN-9854" `	She shakes her head. "Stocked primarily with provisions, those first expeditions were. Prepared to take on proper archaeological study on this planet, they were not. Asked the Quarg about the findings, the Saryds had, but to their surprise they acted as if there was nothing here. For the time, very odd of them to do that, it was." She turns to you with a curious look. "What about humanity, Captain? Found any clues about the species that lived here, have you?"`
	"CN-9855" `	"No, I didn't even know there used to be ruins here."`
	"CN-9856" `	"Actually, yes. They were called Sheragi."`
	"CN-9857" `	Surprised that you know more, she listens to your story with Albert Foster, and how you had a dream about ships evacuating Zug. You tell her of the city buried under the layers of rock, the efforts to uncover it, and how the Quarg eventually sent someone to keep watch of the digging process.`
	"CN-9858" `	"Cities buried whole by lava? Tuned their scanners to look for such odd ruins, no expedition must have..." she stops and thinks for a few minutes, working on the pylon's command panel. "Tell the story again, could you, Captain <last>? Formally record the findings here, I would like." You spend the next few hours retelling what you saw, and helping her collect what information on the Sheragi and their ruins humans have learned since Foster published his initial findings.`
	"CN-9859" `	Once she's satisfied, you two look to your map and match coordinates with the next stop Mimodum made.`
	"CN-9860" `	She frowns slightly. "Figured as much, I had. Well, finding out more about them, the point of this expedition wasn't. A nice bonus, it would've been, but prepare to look for the next pylon, we should."`
	"CN-9861" `	You open your map, and using the coordinates, gather that "Summit" is <planet>, a small moon close to the entrance to The Deep. Sedlitaris returns to her bunk, and you set course to <system>.`
	"CN-9862" `You fly around the moon as Sedlitaris nails down the coordinates of the pylon, until you land close to one of the forests. "Deeper inside, the pylon must be. Uninhabited by humans this world is, correct?" You confirm this, and she prepares to leave. "No dragons to worry about here, there are, so try to bring this pylon back with us, I will."`
	"CN-9863" `	You two leave your ship and enter the forest, taking turns carrying the pylon you brought, which is easy enough to do since the gravity is so much lower here. Occasionally Sedlitaris stops and has the pylon put down so that she can determine where to go next. Eventually, you notice the trees start getting smaller as you move on, until you reach a wide, odd clearing where the ground is devoid of any of the local flora. Sedlitaris spots the other pylon on the opposite side, half stuck in the ground, and moves to pull it out. As you follow her to the machine, you notice deep, perfectly straight holes in the ground, forming lines that sometimes cross the entire clearing and continue well past it. Soil and dust have filled most of them up, but in certain gaps you can look down to cracks that must be dozens of meters deep.`
	"CN-9864" `	Sedlitaris ties a rope around the end of the pylon that's visible and pulls it, forcing up the dirt as she brings the rest of the device to surface. She connects it with the pylon you brought and accesses the data from there. "Much more active here, the expedition was," she says. "Three recordings, there are. Bring these back to your ship, we should; listen to the first one there, we can."`
	"CN-9865" `	Both of you carrying a pylon, you make your way out of the forest and back to your ship, where Sedlitaris immediately plays the oldest entry: "Log started. Send two Punishers further north, I did, but returned yet, they have not. As for the crimson anomaly on the nearby western system, still unresponsive, it is. Be it a Finisher barrage or attempting to ram it, no reaction from the anomaly, there was. A simple nebula, the researchers claim it is not; think that we are missing something, they do. Wait a few more days for the Punishers to return, I will. In the meantime, back to that system, I will go. Maybe learn something about the anomaly, we can."`
	"CN-9866" `	After Mimodum's voice has disappeared, Sedlitaris urges you to take off. "Heard of this 'anomaly' before, I had not. Look for the system it's in, at once we must. Hopefully still there after the centuries, it is."`
	"CN-9867" `Sedlitaris fiddles with the pylon you recovered from <origin>, and lets the second recorded log play while she gazes out to see the "crimson anomaly" Mimodum had mentioned.`
	"CN-9868" `	"Tried just about everything now, we have. A finisher barrage, bombardment from afar, driving asteroids through it, even activating our jump drive while immersed in the red cloud. Told me that it shows some signs of rotation, the chief researcher has; tried to show me the axis around which it spins, she did. Whatever the case, find anything worthwhile about the cloud, we could not. Returning to Summit now, we are, and from there to regroup with the fleet."`
	"CN-9869" `	The recording ends, but Sedlitaris continues looking out to the "cloud" for a few minutes, in silence.`
	"CN-9870" `	"Are you going to play the last one?"`
	"CN-9871" `	"No, just... taking in the view, I was. Unlike any phenomena from within the Coalition, this is."`
	"CN-9872" `	She moves back to the pylon, and hesitates for a moment. "Back to Summit, Mimodum said they would go. Better understand his next steps, we would, if listen to the last entry on that clearing where we found this, we did," she says, tapping the pylon.`
	"CN-9873" `	You tell her you'll go back to <origin> soon, and she heads to her bunk.`
	"CN-9874" `You land next to the forest again and venture into it once more. The trail fresh in your memory, you two reach the clearing quickly, where Sedlitaris puts the pylon close to where it was before being dug out. "Almost like if we were there with them, this should be, being right where they left the pylon. Hopefully a better understanding of what they were thinking, it will also provide."`
	"CN-9875" `	She starts the recording, and sharp, static beeps are the first thing you hear. After a moment, you can make out agitated voices, as if the crew was discussing something, but Sedlitaris' translator doesn't pick it up. Finally, the familiar voice of Mimodum comes out, "Destroyed, the rest of the fleet was. Made it back to the system, one of the Punishers that headed north must have; ran into some debris pieces floating about in the system, we did. Take off, the rest of those on Summit couldn't. The ground is..." the static returns, this time including some scratch-like stops. "... cut like clay... rock... molten..." It switches to static once again, then stops for a moment. When it's back, the interference noises are gone. "Meet with the split group, I must. Warn them of what happened, and head back home with them, I will."`
	"CN-9876" `	You two look at the pylon in silence for a while, then she slowly approaches the machine to pick it up, saying, "Supposed to head back home immediately, expedition ships were, if destroyed, one of the Punishers was. If followed those orders, he had... no guarantee of the split group's survival, he had. If back home, they went..."`
	"CN-9877" `	"He could have, but then the other group wouldn't know that any Punisher was destroyed. They wouldn't know to go back."`
	"CN-9878" `	"Seems like they didn't pick the best person to follow those orders."`
	"CN-9879" `	"We don't know if he could've made it if he had gone back immediately. I'm sure we'll find out more with the next pylon."`
	"CN-9880" `	She doesn't respond, instead looking down at the lines carving the clearing's ground. She moves close to one, laying down and reaching her arms to touch the cracks. A few minutes later, she gets back up and looks to you.`
	"CN-9881" `	"Back to the ship, we should go," she says. "Try and figure out where Mimodum went next, I will. Where he was to meet with the split group."`
	"CN-9882" `	After taking the trail back, Sedlitaris goes into her bunk to tinker with the pylons. She comes out hours after nightfall, asking that you show her your map. "A pincer movement, the two groups were performing. Difficult to know the exact planet, it is, as the data from the split group, we don't have, but figured the overall region where the two groups would link up, I think I have."`
	"CN-9883" `	You help her match the coordinates, and end up with a group of systems between Sol and Tarazed. "Need to visit each system, we might. Pick up faint signals of their next pylon, while in the right system I can, but no way of knowing where that is exactly, I have."`
	"CN-9884" `You fly around <origin> as Sedlitaris searches for the pylon's exact position, in the hopes that she can bring it back as well. She tells you to land by a mountain range, and has you readjust your landing spot every so often as she tries to nail the exact location of the pylon. "Buried it to protect it from the atmosphere's acidity, they must have," she comments.`
	"CN-9885" `	By the time she's done, you open your ship's hatch right to where the pylon should be and help her dig it out, taking care to not be out for too long. When the device is dug out, you bring it inside your ship while Sedlitaris fills up the hole with what dirt had been dug out.`
	"CN-9886" `	As you're flying to the spaceport, she plays the pylon's entry: "Log started. Made a route from Summit straight to the meeting point, I had, but find the split group, I could not. Restless, agitated, the crew has become, heading straight to Ablub, we are, after buried, this thing is. If find this, anyone from the split group is, head back-" at that point an untranslated shouting muffles what Mimodum was saying, followed by dozens of legs in a rush. "No..." is heard right before the recording ends.`
	"CN-9887" `	You focus on flying the ship, but even when you've landed, Sedlitaris remains silent.`
	"CN-9888" `	"He said they were going back immediately, but they never made it. You think that was the last pylon?"`
	"CN-9889" `	She goes without a word for a while still. "Set a route for Ablub, could you, Captain? If follow the same route they used, we do, and if any more to find, there is, pick up the signals, I will."`
	"CN-9890" `	You agree, and look to set a route straight to Ablub.`
	"CN-9891" `Once you're close to the planet's surface, Sedlitaris starts trying to access the recorded data in the pylon. "If possible, recover it later, we can." She tries for a few minutes, but all she can get is a twisted static, so she starts working on determining its location. "Clear up the transmission, getting closer to it should."`
	"CN-9892" `	You fly around until you're right above an ocean, with no land in sight wherever you look. "Below us, it is," she says. "Why underwater? Why throw it into an ocean, would they?" She works on transferring the data to her own pylon, as you won't manage to get to the original one, and clears up the recording as much as possible before playing it.`
	"CN-9893" `	For a few seconds there are only a few ambient sounds, a low background humming, and some heavy breathing. "Ambushed us as we prepared to leave the last planet, they did," Mimodum speaks. "Enough fuel to make it back in one go, we had, so jumped as we could. Too many ships in this system there were, however, like a wall blocking us." He stops briefly, and you can make out something akin to metal falling lightly on a table. "Aware of it, they were. That exploring, we had been. That splitting up, we were. That make it back, we could not. Saw to that, dozens of their ships did. Tried to lose them on this planet, we had, but caught as we came down, we were. Cut off most of the engines, Skylance fire has. A lone, sinking ship, what remains of the sixth is. Hold together, the hull should, but no way out for us, there is." He pauses once again, for well over a minute. "If returned when the men first asked for... No, even then, already waiting, their ships must have been. If split up the fleet, I hadn't... outnumbered all the same, we would be. At least..." Another pause, this time just a few seconds long. "At least... still working, the rifles are."`
	"CN-9894" `	The recording ends, and you two stay in an awkward silence for a minute. "Aware that he had died, I was. Too long it has been. Even if found a safe haven, habitable planet or a friendly group, the fleet had, I knew that long dead, all of them would be." She pauses, and the silence returns for another minute. She shuts off the pylon. "Only, expecting something... anything, I was. A heroic death, a summary of findings. Accomplished nothing, they did. Right after all, the consuls were."`
	"CN-9895" `	"Heroic death or not, he still got some information, didn't he? Information you recovered."`
	"CN-9896" `	"He didn't get the chance to act heroically. He was ambushed."`
	"CN-9897" `	"Massacred, if truthful about the Quarg's numbers, he was," she responds. "Risked a great deal of jump drives, the sixth expedition had. Thought, it was, that with a greater number of Punishers, a greater chance of a safe return, there was." She sighs. "Just decrease our reserve of them, it did."`
	"CN-9898" `	"Inconclusive reports on red nebulas or disappearing ruins, what good are they?" she sighs. "After met up in their pincer movement, the groups had, after exploring points of interest, supposed to drive further than we had previously, they were. To reach the galactic core, to maybe find friendly groups to facilitate more trips... achieved, none of the goals were."`
	"CN-9899" `	She goes back to her bunk, saying she wishes to be alone for a while, and you fly to the planet's spaceport. A few hours later, she comes back out. "Finished my report, I have. Ready to go back home I am, Captain <last>. A long trip this was, and promised to pay you well, I did, so when <planet> we reach, give you your well-earned 10,000,000 credits, I shall. Present my findings to the council, I must."`
	"CN-9900" `	"That's a lot of money. I was worried you wouldn't even want to pay me, with how disappointed you were earlier."`
	"CN-9901" `	"Aren't you worried we'll get ambushed, like how Mimodum's ship was?"`
	"CN-9902" `	She grins for a moment, seemingly taking it as a joke. "If going to ambush us, the Quarg were, already done it, they would have. Too close to the Coalition by now, we are."`
	"CN-9903" `	"Ah, forgive me for that, Captain. True it is, that disappointed, I am. However, an inspector should not let that trouble her duties," she explains. "Done your work, you have, so now do mine, I must. Not discussed in Mimodum's audio entries, many details of interest to the council were. An initial gathering of that data, I have prepared."`
	"CN-9904" `	She asks that you bring her to <destination> as soon as possible, and goes back to her bunk to rest.`
	"CN-9905" `Sedlitaris uses your commlink to tell the spaceport authorities that she's returned, and soon after you land a crowd of Heliarchs and Coalition civilians alike are surrounding your ship. The Heliarch agents try and organize the crowd as best as they can, and a group of Heliarch consuls rush through the masses to meet you two at your ship.`
	"CN-9906" `	"Inspector! A most... fortunate return this is. A great deal of information you've collected, we take it?" an Arach consul asks.`
	"CN-9907" `	"Yes, eager to hear your report, we are," one of the Kimek consuls continues. "A rare occasion, it is, to be able to learn of the outside from one of our esteemed inspectors."`
	"CN-9908" `	A Saryd consul, who's kept a stern look on his face, cuts in. "Returned with his fleet, your ancestor, Mimodum, did not. Learned of the reason for that, have you?"`
	"CN-9909" `	"Yes," she says. "Recover as much information as I wished to, I could not, but prepared a report on what Captain <last> and I found, I have. Additionally, recovered two of the pylons Mimodum left, we have."`
	"CN-9910" `	One of the consuls addresses you, "Tell us, Captain, run into any er... complications during the trip, have you? Maybe occasioned by the tribune - the inspector - being with you?"`
	"CN-9911" `	"She stayed inside my ship whenever there was a risk of humans seeing her, if that's what you're asking."`
	"CN-9912" `	"I didn't notice anything out of the usual, no."`
	"CN-9913" `	They call for some agents to get the pylons out of your ship and transport them to somewhere Sedlitaris can present her findings. As they tell her to follow them to the room where the presentation will happen, a Kimek Heliarch breaks through the line of agents keeping the crowd back. You recognize him as Arbiter Kicharri, who you met just before Sedlitaris received approval from the Heliarch council.`
	"CN-9914" `	"What is this?" The Saryd consul steps in front of Kicharri as he approaches. "Arbiter, shared with you in due time, the findings will be, but the inspector's report to us consuls, the priority is, so return to your duties you-"`
	"CN-9915" `	"No, meet with her family, she will," Kicharri interrupts him. "Heard nothing but hell from her brother, I have. Devastated, her parents were. Now that returned, she has, see them and calm their worries, she will."`
	"CN-9916" `	"By whose orders?" An Arach consul jumps in. "Intrigued by her findings, we all are, and listen to her at once, we must."`
	"CN-9917" `	"Orders?" Kicharri exclaims. "Orders for her to leave and die, you thought you had given her!" Kicharri looks at Sedlitaris, then back at the consuls. "If so intrigued you are, surely to miss out on any information, you don't want. Best suited for giving a full report, she will be, once rested from her expedition, she has."`
	"CN-9918" `	Irked by his response, the consuls have the agents clear the area and have your ship made into a makeshift meeting room for a while, making everyone get out while they head inside to discuss. After many minutes, they come back out, and one of the Kimek says, "Ten days of leave you will be given, tribune. After that, present us your findings, you must. Considered for promotion to arbiter, you also will be, for your bravery and work in the expedition."`
	"CN-9919" `	The consul group leaves, and Kicharri approaches you and Sedlitaris. "Tell me about how you were right all along, later, you can," Kicharri tells Sedlitaris. "Right now, add you back to the list of active Heliarchs, I must. Marked as deceased by a 'glitch in the system,' you apparently were." He taps one leg on the ground repeatedly, glancing at your ship. "Glad that you are back safely, I am."`
	"CN-9920" `	He leaves as well, and Sedlitaris turns to you. "A bit disorganized, but at least welcomed we were, right?" She looks at your ship, then looks startled. "Your payment! No time to transfer the funds to you, they gave me," she pulls out a personal device, and transfers the 10,000,000 credits to your account. "There you are. Worth much more, your assistance was, but unfortunately limited, my funds are."`
	"CN-9921" `	"Don't worry, I'm glad to have helped."`
	"CN-9922" `	"Why was everyone so surprised we made it back? Seems they expected to never see you again."`
	"CN-9923" `	Her smile drops as you ask the question, and she seemingly struggles to find a place to look at. "I... I, Captain-" She looks around, then takes a deep breath. "Sorry I am, Captain. Ever since independence from the Quarg, we gained, six expeditions out of the Coalition, there were. Return, only ships of the first of them did. The most well equipped and numerous, my ancestor's fleet was, the sixth expeditionary fleet. Increasingly more fearful of leaving, we became, and with the last expedition having been centuries ago, a taboo, even talking about leaving has become. A year after the sixth had left, effectively forbid any further expeditions, the council did." She travels around with her eyes again. "Sorry I am, that kept it hidden from you, I have. Wish to find out what happened, I did. Afraid I was, that refuse to help me like everyone else, you would, if know of the risk, you did."`
	"CN-9924" `	"Well, we made it back safely, and you were passionate enough about this to take the risk. I don't hold it against you."`
	"CN-9925" `	"So you lied to me. You could've gotten us both killed - we could be in a ship sinking into an ocean."`
	"CN-9926" `	She's taken aback. "Captain, no Quarg pursuing us, there were. Surely now that inhabit all those systems, humans do, avoid attacking ships like that..." She stops, and sighs. "Sorry for lying to you I am, Captain."`
	"CN-9927" `	She breathes in relief. "Thank you, Captain. To trick you, my intention wasn't. Thanks to your help, maybe put an end to this fear of leaving, or even convince the council to get the expedition efforts going again, I can."`
	"CN-9928" `	Suddenly, a Saryd Sojourner nearly rams your ship, just barely avoiding it as it lands less than twenty meters from your ship. "My little brother," Sedlitaris says as she looks at the ship. "Forgive me Captain, but get to seeing my family, I must. From the discussion earlier, very worried about me, they must have been. Thanks again for everything." Her brother rushes into hugging her as he leaves his ship, then proceeds to shake her while screaming something. An elderly Saryd couple slowly comes out of the Sojourner as well, and Sedlitaris and her brother go and meet them, hugging and going inside. The Sojourner takes off before the spaceport workers can even begin tending to the ship, and you look at it as it leaves the ringworld.`
	"CN-9929" `	When you go back inside your ship, you're notified that more credits have been transferred to your account. It seems to be from the Heliarch government, giving you an extra 25,000,000 credits and thanking you for helping recover the data of the sixth expedition.`
	"CN-9930" `	When you go back inside your ship, you're notified that more credits have been transferred to your account. It seems to be from the Heliarch government, giving you an extra 25,000,000 credits and thanking you for helping recover the data of the sixth expedition. You decide to take some time to rest in your ship, after all that's happened, but not an hour passes before your ship is hailed by the local authorities, asking you to please open your hatch.`
	"CN-9931" `	You comply, and one of the Heliarch consuls from earlier, a Saryd, comes in. "Hello, Captain," he greets you with a somewhat shaky voice. "Just going over the findings, we were..." he struggles at finding words, eyes fixated on the ground. "Caught our attention the most, the report on Ancient Light has. The report about the 'Sheragi' and the ruins on a nearby world." He pauses, and pulls out a device similar to the one Sedlitaris used to transfer you your payment. "Finished the journey of ancient Saryd inspectors, humanity's efforts, your efforts, have. For that, hope to compensate you and the girl enough, the council cannot." He inputs a few commands, and you look to see you've received another 15,000,000 credits. "Sent her to die, we had. I had. And with answers to secrets our ancestors dreamed of unveiling, she returned." His eyes finally come up, meeting yours. "Glad I am, that proud of at least one of us, they can be." He looks away again, gives you a nod, and leaves your ship.`
	"CN-9932" `You notice a pair of Arachi, who you assume to be spaceport workers due to their uniforms, talking while pointing to your ship. One of them is slightly shorter than most Arach you've seen, while the other is a good bit taller. They approach you after they see you noticed them, and the larger of them speaks up. "Excuse us you must, Captain, but in need of your help, we are."`
	"CN-9933" `	"Work at House Idriss, we do, and looking to recover some lost property, the House is," the shorter one explains. "Accompany us to our headquarters, could you? Meet up with you, our boss-"`
	"CN-9934" `	"President," the other one interrupts him.`
	"CN-9935" `	"Our president will."`
	"CN-9936" `	"I've got some time. Lead the way."`
	"CN-9937" `	"What is it that you lost?"`
	"CN-9938" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested."`
	"CN-9939" `	"Umm... confidential information, that is," the taller one says. "If wish to learn more, you do, accompany us, you should."`
	"CN-9940" `	"Alright then, show me the way."`
	"CN-9941" `	"This seems a bit shady. I'll pass."`
	"CN-9942" `	They bring you to a dead end street not far from the spaceport surrounded by various older buildings. A wide hole is at the end, almost like a subway entrance, with stairs leading dozens of meters underground. You follow them down the stairs to find something similar to a customs area, where some Arachi and Kimek in uniforms ready their stations once they see you three.`
	"CN-9943" `	You continue after some waiting, as the operators insist on manually inspecting every last bit of your electronic devices. Inside, you see a few dozen workers at their computers, with one occasionally heading to the back and taking an elevator somewhere. They seldom talk, so the only sound you can make out is that of some machinery working below you. Eventually, you're greeted by an Arach in some manner of tuxedo, or at least their equivalent to one, a blueish fabric dotted with black buttons. "Ah, Captain <last>, you must be!" she greets you. "To our corporate headquarters, I welcome you."`
	"CN-9944" `	She urges you to follow her to her office, and you go along with the two Arachi who guided you here. Once you're in the office, a modest, spacious room made to accommodate the Arachi, she introduces herself. "Flopug, you may call me. Acting president of House Idriss, I am. Now, told about what we need your services for, were you?"`
	"CN-9945" `	"These two told me House Idriss lost something."`
	"CN-9946" `	"No, not really."`
	"CN-9947" `	"Nearly nine thousand years ago, before even formed, the Coalition was, launched a... probe of sorts, for a long term experiment, that time's House Idriss had," she explains. "Sent to a nearby system where a habitable planet could be, it was, accelerating to approximately half the speed of light." She taps somewhere on the desk with one of her legs, and a screen appears at the top, showing a map of the local star systems. "Recognize this one, do you?" she asks, pointing to one of the systems. "A system currently inhabited by humans, we believe it is. Arrive there, the probe soon should, if arrived already, it hasn't."`
	"CN-9948" `	Upon further inspection, you piece together the systems in the screen, and realize the system she's pointing to is <system>, just one jump away.`
	"CN-9949" `	"I haven't heard news of any probes entering Han."`
	"CN-9950" `	"So what do you want me to do?"`
	"CN-9951" `	"No? Well, the destination for the probe, that system was. Hmm... maybe delaying itself for some extra data..." She goes quiet, lost in thought for a while.`
	"CN-9952" `	"Need someone to retrieve the probe, we do. Designed, it was, with an artificial intelligence that would learn during the trip, so even if terribly outdated, the equipment is, possibly invaluable, the data it gathered by observing starlight could be. Or simply mildly amusing, but hoping for the former, we are."`
	"CN-9953" `	"Alright, I'll go look for it."`
	"CN-9954" `	"What if I can't find it in the system? If it hasn't arrived, would I need to wait a long time for it to get there?"`
	"CN-9955" `	"What's in it for me?"`
	"CN-9956" `	"Pay you handsomely for the retrieval, House Idriss would," she answers. "Also, if of any use, the data is, adapted to deep space, the artificial intelligence may have done. New technologies, this could provide us, and to you we would share such a prize."`
	"CN-9957" `	"Not too long," the short Arach answers. "Minor changes in its speed, the probe might have had, but delay its arrival for more than a few weeks, it could not. One week from now, the absolute limit date for its arrival is."`
	"CN-9958" `	"If locate it immediately, you do not, maybe ask the local humans you could," the taller one adds. "Newsworthy in most systems, such an event would be."`
	"CN-9959" `	They show you an image of the probe, which looks pretty much like an ordinary satellite, and say they'll work on your ship's scanning system to pick up the object's signature easier. Flopug says goodbye and tells you she must continue working, but has the two Arachi bring you back to your ship and adjust your scanners. They wish you good luck once they're done, and leave your ship.`
	"CN-9960" `After looking up the recent local news, you feel relieved as you won't need to wait for the probe to arrive: average headlines like "Unidentified Object Enters Han" or more sensationalist ones like "Doomsday Drone! What YOU Can Do In the Face of Impending Doom" were all the rage a few weeks ago, when the probe first arrived. None of them detail what happened to it, though, so you decide to ask the planet's inhabitants.`
	"CN-9961" `	The spaceport workers you ask don't seem to know much more than the fact that it entered the system weeks ago, and some of the locals seem to have believed the more dramatic headlines, getting worried when you bring it up. When you reach the local produce market, one of the farmers you ask sheds some light on the issue. "A band of pirates passed by here just a few days after I watched the news about that machine. They were here for the usual, getting food from us as tribute. Must've read the news while they were here. One of them asked me about it, if we had seen it do anything dangerous. I said no, and he muttered something about selling it in a junkyard."`
	"CN-9962" `	"Did you catch his name?"`
	"CN-9963" `	"Do you know where he went to sell it?"`
	"CN-9964" `	"No, but I'd guess <planet>. It's the biggest hub for their kind of activity around these parts."`
	"CN-9965" `	He snickers lightly, shaking his head. "I don't keep a list of their names. It's rare enough that any of them come around more than once, most get blown out of the sky before they get the chance. It's a short life they lead, those gangs from <planet>."`
	"CN-9966" `	You thank him for the information, and decide to head to <destination> to see if you can find the pirate who scavenged the probe, or the junkyard he sold it to.`
	"CN-9967" `When you ask one of the market organizers about a local pirate returning with an alien probe, you find out he already sold it. You are then pointed to a large, surprisingly well-kept junkyard, which is something of a miniature shipyard: a few crews work on their ships in the vicinity, adding or switching parts for those they just bought. The junkyard itself is surrounded by half a dozen concrete buildings, with defensive turrets on top. A few excavators and bulldozers move ship pieces and other components around, trying to keep everything organized.`
	"CN-9968" `	You tell one of the workers you're looking for the probe, and they leave for a few minutes, heading inside the gray building by the entrance.`
	"CN-9969" `	They come back alone, saying, "Boss has looked you up, and found your pockets a bit empty. If you want that kind of information, come back when you're ready to pay."`
	"CN-9970" `	When they come back, they beckon you to go inside, bringing you to a simple office where a middle-aged, balding man is waiting. "So, I hear you're looking for my latest big acquisition? Mind telling me what has you so interested in it?"`
	"CN-9971" `	"I was hired to get it for someone."`
	"CN-9972" `	"No reason."`
	"CN-9973" `	He grins. "Well, you're out of luck, it was sold the day after I got it. Damn shame I couldn't make more advertisement out of it, but the offer was too good." He gets up from his chair, and leans on the table, looking at you. "Now, I like to keep business organized around here, so of course, I know a thing or two about who the buyers were. I can't just tell you, though, I deal with dangerous people at times. One day I tell you where they are, the other there's a fleet ready to tear down my business here. If I had, say, a million credits to hire some helpers in case that happened..."`
	"CN-9974" `	"When I'm done they won't have a fleet to come here. A hundred thousand should be enough of a tip for pointing me their way."`
	"CN-9975" `	"Fine, just tell me already."`
	"CN-9976" `	He stares at you for a few seconds, and lets out a laugh. "Well, it was worth a try. Alright, a hundred thousand it is."`
	"CN-9977" `	"Now I can't just trust you to get every last one of their ships, can I?" he replies. "If you want to make it worth for me, it's a million. If you're not interested, there's nothing I can do about it."`
	"CN-9978" `	"Thank you for your patronage," he says, and sits back down.`
	"CN-9979" `	"The men who approached me for the machine are pirates, though I imagine you already had that figured out," he begins. "They aren't from the south though, I could tell you that much. Older, better dressed. Said they had read the reports about the 'unknown probe' entering Han, and wanted it for their business. I asked how they intended to use it, nobody here had figured how it worked, but they said they'd find a way to make use of it, have it serve as some kind of surveillance equipment, or something like that."`
	"CN-9980" `	"What do you think they meant by that?"`
	"CN-9981" `	"Did you catch their names?"`
	"CN-9982" `	"Did they tell me their names? Yes. Their real ones? Doubt it. They seemed organized enough that they wanted to keep that information hidden. I did get a look at their ships while we were loading the product into one of them, though."`
	"CN-9983" `	He shrugs, "My guess is their base is behind some bottleneck, so they wanted something that could tell them in advance if any Navy or bounty hunter was coming for them. I did get to look at their ships, seemed very well equipped for running away, if they knew someone was coming."`
	"CN-9984" `	He tells you the ship the probe was loaded onto was a Quicksilver, heavily modified to make for a stronger warship. You walk out of the junkyard with the information, and prepare your ship to look for the pirates.`
	"CN-9985" `The pirates are waiting for you when you board their Quicksilver, and you exchange shots for a while. Once you've cleared the entrance, you explore the ship, and find what should be the probe - it matches what you were shown by House Idriss' workers, if with a lot of extra wiring wrapped around it. The pirates must have tinkered with it in attempts to use it as a warning system about incoming fleets. You remove the wires, free the probe from its attachments to the ship, and let it loose into the void. You then hurry back to your ship, and catch the drifting probe into your hold. Now you need only bring it back to House Idriss.`
	"CN-9986" `After you land, you head to the underground base of House Idriss, where Flopug meets with you again. "Arrange for the probe to be brought here at once, I will," she says, dispatching some workers to where your ship is. After a few minutes, she is informed that it's secured in the "lower levels," and heads there herself to take a look at what data it gathered.`
	"CN-9987" `	When she returns, followed by the Arach duo who brought you here the first time, she hands you <payment>. "Registers of some attempts at breaching the probe's security, there are, but compromised the data, thankfully none of them have. A most curious path, its AI took," she says. "As fine-tuned as our current systems, it is not, but developed its algorithms to better determine the current status of distant stars, it has. Still going over the data, we are, so how accurate it became, we don't yet know."`
	"CN-9988" `	The other Arachi tell you they'll meet you in the spaceport once they finish checking the data, as they'd like you to check a system personally in order to compare it with what the probe's information. They accompany you to the staircase leading back to the street, then head back to continue analyzing the data.`
	"CN-9989" `You fight you way through the ship, but after you search the cargo hold and outfits in the Quicksilver, you realize the probe must be in another ship.`
	"CN-9990" `After walking in the oddly empty vessel for a while, you hear an alarm sound and see pirates rushing to you from a door they blast open. You head back to your ship, avoiding what shots come your way as best as you can, and quickly close off the entrance on your side. When you look at the Quicksilver again, you see its self-destruction sequence is starting.`
	"CN-9991" `The Arach duo greet you in the spaceport and ask you to bring them inside your ship to talk. They look to the sides and behind them every other moment, as if watching out for something. When you're inside your ship's command room, the taller one speaks. "Compared the probe's prediction with its last reading of the system of arrival, we have. A very good approximation to real conditions, it reached. Though incredibly outdated, its hardware is, an ingenious program, what my ancestors-"`
	"CN-9992" `	"Our ancestors," the short one interrupts him.`
	"CN-9993" `	"What our ancestors created is."`
	"CN-9994" `	They show you a device with a map on screen, depicting nearby star systems, and the short Arach starts explaining. "Intrigued as to just how accurate its predictions have become, we are, so to verify its data about a star deeper in human space, the next step is." He points to a system at the edge of the map. "Have humans discovered this system, Captain? Interested in comparing the probe's data on far away binary stars, the president is."`
	"CN-9995" `	You look at the screen and at your own map for a moment, and recognize the system as <waypoints>. "Settled it is, then. Head to that system, you should," the taller one speaks again. "Still with our adjustments, your scanners are, so just tinker them a bit to gather the needed data, we will."`
	"CN-9996" `	Once they're done with your scanners a few minutes later, they leave your ship and wish you good luck.`
	"CN-9997" `Flopug is waiting by the landing bays for you, with the Arach duo beside her. They come inside your ship when you've landed, and start checking the data, after Flopug pays you <payment>.`
	"CN-9998" `	"Umm... more errors with this one, the probe committed," the taller Arach says. "Gotten a good deal right, it still did, but a shame it is, that deal with that much more of a distance, it couldn't."`
	"CN-9999" `	"Not distance, the cause of errors was," the short Arach responds. "Confused with the binaries' signatures, it got. Refined to account for binary star systems and their oddities, its algorithms had to be."`
	"CN-10000" `	"At any rate, happy to call the probe's voyage a success, I am," Flopug cuts them off. "Expected it to have developed this well, we hadn't, when notified of its existence by... I mean, when remember about the approaching date of its arrival to that system, we did."`
	"CN-10001" `	They turn your scanners back to normal, telling you that they'll work on using the data to develop a new piece of scanning equipment. They also tell you that they will let you know about it when it's ready, the next time you're on <origin>, though it may be many months before they're ready. After thanking you for your help once again, the three Arachi leave your ship.`
	"CN-10002" `When you leave your ship, you're greeted by Flopug of House Idriss. "Completed the work on our newest set of scanners, we have. Since helped us with recovering the probe and its data, you have, only fair, it is, that gifted a copy of the equipment, you are."`
	"CN-10003" `	She asks to come in your ship, and tells you to take off, guiding you to a factory complex on another region of the planet. As the <ship> touches down on the hangar, the platform loudly moves gears and chains, and soon starts bringing the ship, and you, deep down into the facility, with hangar doors closing above you shortly. When the elevator stops, you and Flopug step out into what's something of a mix between a Coalition outfitter, and House Idriss' headquarters. Several Arachi work on their stations, most of them tending to a large amalgam of antennae dishes and sensors. "Our gift to you, that is," Flopug says as she signals to the Arachi to start installing the scanner into your ship. "The Outskirts Gauger, we've named it."`
	"CN-10004" `	While the Arachi work on the outfit, she explains that they used the probe's algorithms to have the scanners excel at finding basic energy signatures, such as heat or energy levels of other ships. "Made to check for complex machinery like outfits, or recognize specific cargo types, it was not, but still find uses for its current form, I'm sure you will."`
	"CN-10005" `	When everything's ready, you two head back inside your ship, and the elevator brings you back up. You fly back to the main landing area, and she pulls close to you just before you open your hatch. "Now, still... experimental, the outfit is, and provide the Heliarchs with a potentially faulty product, we do not wish. So, naturally, not yet registered it with them, we have. Provide you with more copies, we cannot, so careful not to lose this one, you should be." She thanks you again for helping out, and leaves for her workplace.`
	"CN-10006" `Your ship has barely touched down in the <origin> when several dozen Heliarch warships of all sizes start landing around it. The local garrison wastes no time in hailing you. "Captain <last>, our esteemed friend. Noticed it was that in your possession an extra jump drive is. Aid us tremendously any extra copies would, so if willing to sell your spare to us you are, thank you with <payment> we will." Many Heliarchs leave their ships, staring at the <ship> as they eagerly wait for your decision.`
	"CN-10007" `	(Accept the deal.)`
	"CN-10008" `	(No, I'm not interested.)`
	"CN-10009" `	"Regrettable that is," the Heliarch voice hailing you says with great disappointment. "If ever change your mind you do, prepared, a special job request will be, for when a spare jump drive you bring. Recommend it we do that our offer you carefully consider, Captain. Very generous in rewarding you for any and all copies you bring us, we would be."`
	"CN-10010" `	They thank you profusely, and as if collectively told about the decision in an instant, all the Heliarch personnel stop gawking, and make space for an army of engineers to come and remove the spare jump drive from your ship. Still watching the scene, only now in formations, the Heliarch agents whisper among themselves, rarely shifting their eyes, as if looking at a spectacle.`
	"CN-10011" `	Once the drive is out of your ship, it is secured in an excessively reinforced container and transported to a restricted section of the ring, under the guard of hundreds of armed soldiers. One of the Heliarchs who seem to be in charge of the procedure, an Arach, personally comes to you, thanking you again and handing you <payment>. "Honor us you do with such generosity, Captain. Though made great progress in studying jump drives and their mechanisms, we have, still incapable of creating our own, we are, and means of acquiring new copies we have not. Tremendously valuable, each and every drive you could bring us is, so prepare special job requests for them, I will. If interested in selling any more jump drives, you are, check the job boards in the rings, from now on you should."`
	"CN-10012" `	She thanks you yet again, salutes, and leaves to follow the entourage guarding the newly purchased jump drive. Not a minute after she has left, three more Heliarchs arrive at your ship, a delegation consisting of a member of each of the three Coalition species, all wearing golden circlets denoting their rank and authority. "A most unexpected, but greatly valued contribution this is," the Saryd says, "to think that so eager would our visitor be to prove their diligence and commitment."`
	"CN-10013" `As you walk through the spaceport, you see a group of Kimek and an Arachi seated at a table, deep in conversation. One of them glances toward you. As if something suddenly clicked, the group quickly rises from their seats and begin approaching you.`
	"CN-10014" `	"Excuse me, what do you all want?"`
	"CN-10015" `	"Hello? What is it?"`
	"CN-10016" `	(Reach for my gun.)`
	"CN-10017" `	The lead Kimek jumps back. "Mean you harm, we did not. Unrelated to violence, our quest is. Speak to you, may we?"`
	"CN-10018" `	"No, you may not. Goodbye."`
	"CN-10019" `	The group of Coalition citizens go back to their table with disappointed expressions.`
	"CN-10020" `	"Collectors of literature, we are. Curious about your race, and the books they have written, we are, so for you, a mission we have," says the lead Kimek, who then introduces themselves as Kachachee. "Literature of many kinds, we read, from science fiction to tales of alien worlds outside of our homeland.`
	"CN-10021" `	"Greetings, human friend. Collectors of literature, we are. Curious about your race, and the books they have written, we are, so for you, a mission we have," says a Kimek, who then introduces themselves as Kachachee. "Literature of many kinds, we read, from science fiction to tales of alien worlds outside of our homeland.`
	"CN-10022" `	"A small mission, it is. Knowledge from your race, we seek. Pay you <payment> and very grateful, we would be, if accept this mission, you will," they explain.`
	"CN-10023" `	"I'm in. What do you want me to collect?"`
	"CN-10024" `	"Anything. A translation device, we have. To translate the human language into our own, we are able. Tales of vile oppressors and the heroic stands against them, always popular amongst our peoples, the topic is. Stories of brave battles, tyrants and rebels. Histories of humanity's resistance movements, we seek."`
	"CN-10025" `	"Why do you want this knowledge? What is your group about?"`
	"CN-10026" `	"I see. I will bring you all the knowledge you want."`
	"CN-10027" `	"I'm not interested. Sorry."`
	"CN-10028" `	"Thank you. Enlighten us and the rest of the Coalition, your actions will. A safe trip, we hope you have." They give you instructions on where to find them.`
	"CN-10029" `	You recall that your ship has a datachip containing a copy of Alexandria's archives, which may be what the group wants. You walk to your ship, make a copy of the datachip, and return to the group.`
	"CN-10030" `	Kachachee then approaches you as you hand them the datachip. "Very speedy, your return was."`
	"CN-10031" `	"Happy to help."`
	"CN-10032" `	"I hope you enjoy whatever my race has to offer for you."`
	"CN-10033" `	"Thank you. Enlighten me and my friends, this datachip will. And as promised, a chip of <payment>, we have." Kachachee places it in your hand.`
	"CN-10034" `	"A group who likes to read books together, we are. Science fiction, I believe the term is, especially."`
	"CN-10035" `	A quick search of the Worlds Wide Web reveals that the library of <stopovers> has data chips containing a complete database of all human culture and history. You return to your ship and prepare for the journey there to acquire one.`
	"CN-10036" `You had wondered how you would get a copy of the entire cultural archive, but it turns out to be easier than expected. The station has a small museum gift shop, which sells a copy of the archives on a data card. ("The perfect gift for the budding historian in your family! Hold all of human history in the palm of your hand. On sale now for only 39.99!") Given that a cheap data card costs a fraction of a credit, it's a bit of a rip-off, but you gladly buy one to take back to Kachachee.`
	"CN-10037" `The station has a small museum gift shop that sells a copy of the entire archive on a data card. It only costs 40 credits, but because you have done a horrible job at managing your finances you do not have even that much cash on hand right now.`
	"CN-10038" `	Go earn some money, then return here.`
	"CN-10039" `You head to the bar where you first met Kachachee. When you arrive, the Kimek greets you, "Thank you. Enlighten me and my friends, this datachip will. A chip of <payment>, as promised, we have." Kachachee places it in your hand.`
	"CN-10040" `After an uneventful trip to the spaceport, you return to your <model>. Once aboard, you see a message from the group of Coalition citizens whom you gave a copy of Alexandria's archive to:`
	"CN-10041" `	Dear <first>,`
	"CN-10042" `		An author from the datachip, we are interested in. "Anna Fangvin," her name is. The full book, while we could not access, the summary of your race's actions against the oppressors, captivate us, it did. To converse with her, we wish. A copy of the book, we desire.`
	"CN-10043" `	Kachachee`
	"CN-10044" `	(Look for Anna Fangvin.)`
	"CN-10045" `	(Discard the message.)`
	"CN-10046" `	A quick look through your ship's data files reveals nothing. However, checking a copy of the data chip that you gave the Coalition citizens reveals Anna Fangvin to be an author from a human planet in the Rim. After a few maddening minutes of trying to find the book on the Worlds Wide Web, you decide to find her on <destination> for an interview.`
	"CN-10047" `As you prepare to land, you send Anna a short message asking to interview her at a restaurant near the spaceport. Less than ten minutes later, she replies - she accepted your offer and will wait for you there.`
	"CN-10048" `Upon reaching the spaceport, you walk to the restaurant to meet Anna Fangvin, the author that the Coalition citizens showed interest in. A woman raises her arm to wave at you - she must be Anna.`
	"CN-10049" `	You approach and sit beside her. "Hello, are you <first>?" she asks.`
	"CN-10050" `	"Yes. What do you write?"`
	"CN-10051" `	"Yes. Can I have a copy of your book Beyond the Hyperdrive?"`
	"CN-10052" `	"I write science fiction novels. I just released Beyond the Hyperdrive, the story of a group of humans who steal the Quarg's jumping technology and see what's truly beyond the hyperlanes we've known for so long. Here, take a look!"`
	"CN-10053" `	Anna retrieves a hardcover book from her bag. The cover shows a human next to a Quarg Wardragon. You skim the front and back flaps, confirming most of what Anna told you about it. Her signature is on the title page.`
	"CN-10054" `	"How long is it?"`
	"CN-10055" `	"Why is it a story about humanity stealing from the Quarg?"`
	"CN-10056" `	"That flap has a very nice illustration."`
	"CN-10057" `	"Anything else aside from Beyond the Hyperdrive?"`
	"CN-10058" `	"Beyond the Hyperdrive is the fifth book I've ever published, actually," says Anna. "The other four never... they didn't do very well." She glances at the ground. "I also write short stories on the hypernet in my free time. In fact, I'll probably start writing my sixth in a couple months, as soon as I find a good idea."`
	"CN-10059" `	"What kind of short stories have you written?"`
	"CN-10060" `	"How about your previous books?"`
	"CN-10061" `	"They weren't really successful. To be honest, I'm still struggling to make ends meet. I make a little money off of the few people that buy them, but I never quite reach the five-digits. The first one was self-published. All the publishers rejected it, so I couldn't get much attention for it. The second one was about a kid from the Paradise Worlds, sent to the Dirt Belt by his parents for being spoiled. The third one was about that same kid being kidnapped by pirates. I stopped that series since it was clear it would never sell. And, the fourth one, well..." Anna sighs. "That one was such a failure I don't even want to tell you about it.`
	"CN-10062" `	"Beyond the Hyperdrive is the fifth one, and I'm hoping it will sell better than the previous four."`
	"CN-10063" `	"How about short stories?"`
	"CN-10064" `	"I write short stories and put them up on the hypernet sometimes. Helps me improve my writing and get that urge satiated without committing to a project as long-term as a novel."`
	"CN-10065" `	Anna shows you a webpage with all her stories. The view counts appear to be in the hundreds, with the occasional one reaching four digits.`
	"CN-10066" `	"So why is Beyond the Hyperdrive about humans stealing from the Quarg?"`
	"CN-10067" `	"Well, thank you! I got it printed in a shop on Starcross - the shipping fees were exorbitant, but it's definitely very nice!"`
	"CN-10068" `	"About three hundred pages - ninety thousand words. Not too long."`
	"CN-10069" `	"Have you written any other novels?"`
	"CN-10070" `	"What made you decide to set the Quarg as villains in Beyond the Hyperdrive?"`
	"CN-10071" `	Over the course of a few seconds, Anna's optimistic smile sinks, and her eyes seem to dull. "You'll probably laugh, but, well... I have something of a... problem with them. I still remember when I was a little girl, my parents took me to Humanika during a vacation trip. It was my first time on a world so alien, so naturally, I wanted to explore. I wandered off from our tour group, and soon realized I was lost." She looks back at you momentarily, as if gauging how you're taking her tale. "There were so many hallways, twists and turns - I still cannot figure out how I ended up in that maze. It was a darker portion of the spaceport, and as I kept calling out for my parents, I only ever heard my own voice echoing back. And then, I saw it. A large Quarg, with eyes of a deep, piercing purple, staring right at me, far down the hallway. I broke into a sprint to flee, but I kept running into more and more Quarg... I don't remember much after that, just that I eventually got back to my parents.`
	"CN-10072" `	"And then when I grew up, when I was a teenager, I decided to do a project on the Quarg for college, assisting a journalist writing an article on them. I tried to keep the memories of that episode in my childhood away, for the sake of the project, but as I interviewed them, as I tried to talk and befriend them... even the polite ones, they seemed so... aloof. Different - and not in a good way. I just felt a great unease being there, near them again. It certainly didn't help that they often responded with silence to my questions, as if they had something to hide. For months I tried, but they just would not budge, and that eerie feeling whenever one was with me never went away..."`
	"CN-10073" `	(Tell her about the Coalition.)`
	"CN-10074" `	"That must have been rough, stuck on Humanika. How did your parents eventually find you?"`
	"CN-10075" `	"Can I have a copy of the book?"`
	"CN-10076" `	"Well that's all well and good. But I have my own business to attend to now. Good luck with your book, thanks for your time, and goodbye."`
	"CN-10077" `	"I'm afraid I can't afford to give it away right now."`
	"CN-10078" `	"I have no idea. But it was distressing being stuck with that Quarg for what felt like an eternity. I don't remember exactly how long. Eventually, another Quarg brought my parents to me. I told them I wanted to get off Humanika as fast as possible and get back to Zug. They obliged, and we left that world; I've never wanted to go back."`
	"CN-10079" `	"So you said your books don't sell well, right?"`
	"CN-10080" `	While Anna tries her best to maintain her composure, her features clearly show she's not comfortable with the topic. "No, they don't," she eventually says. "Even some of my friends and family don't have much good to say about them, and fewer still are inclined to do anything for me." Her eyes take on a vaguely more optimistic light. "Do you, perhaps... work for some publisher? Someone interested in my work?"`
	"CN-10081" `	"No actually, I'm afraid I don't know anyone who could help you."`
	"CN-10082" `	You begin explaining the Coalition to Anna, going in-depth about their culture and their long history of opposing the Quarg, seeing as Anna has less than positive opinions of them. At first Anna does not believe you, but you reassure her it's real. You also mention the population of the Coalition and the novelty of an "alien" author coming into the area.`
	"CN-10083" `	"Will they really like my books?"`
	"CN-10084" `	"They will, hopefully."`
	"CN-10085" `	"Well, it's better to try than to just give up."`
	"CN-10086" `	"These stories might just inspire my next novel. But they wouldn't speak our language. How are they going to read my books?" You reply, "They have a translation device."`
	"CN-10087" `	"That's reassuring... but, how am I even going to get there?" she queries.`
	"CN-10088" `	"I'll take you there."`
	"CN-10089" `	"I don't think you can."`
	"CN-10090" `	Her tone of voice becomes much more excited. "Do I have to pay anything? I can't afford off-world transport at all, let alone to a completely different segment of the galaxy! Actually, I know - I'll give you a copy of Beyond the Hyperdrive! Thank you so much! Just wait for a while. I'll go over to my house and bring what I'll need for the trip, and then we can go to whatever this Coalition thing is," says Anna.`
	"CN-10091" `	As you wait for Anna, you look over your maps of Coalition space to double-check what planet the Coalition book club is on. After a quick look, you find <destination>.`
	"CN-10092" `	After approximately an hour of waiting, Anna appears outside of your ship, knocking on the hatch. You open it to let her inside and prepare to leave the spaceport.`
	"CN-10093" `	Filled with disappointment, Anna says, "Well, I'm afraid I have other things to do, then. Thank you for the stories, at least." She leaves.`
	"CN-10094" `	"I'm afraid I can't afford to give one away right now, but I'm happy to show it to you. I assume you already know that it's the story of a group of humans who steal the Quarg's jumping technology and see what's truly beyond the hyperlanes we've known for so long."`
	"CN-10095" `As the flames of your jump drive fade away, Anna comes out of her bunk in shock. "What was that? It felt like the whole ship vanished out of our space altogether! Where are we?"`
	"CN-10096" `	"My jump drive would like to welcome you to Coalition space."`
	"CN-10097" `	"That was a jump drive."`
	"CN-10098" `	"That's what happens every time I go to Coalition space with a jump drive."`
	"CN-10099" `	"Wow. I can't believe this is happening!" Anna looks out the window, then turns back.`
	"CN-10100" `	"Can I take a look at your jump drive? I'm interested to see how it works," Anna says. You take her to the engine room of the <ship>, where she begins taking notes and pictures of the drive.`
	"CN-10101" `	"Well, thank you for bringing me here," Anna says when she finishes. "I didn't sleep too well, so I'll see you later. Goodbye!" She heads back into her cabin, and you settle back into the controls.`
	"CN-10102" `Anna gives you the book before you both exit the <ship>. The moment you are out, three Kimek with golden circlets on their heads approach you and Anna.`
	"CN-10103" `	"Greetings, <first> <last>. This other human you have brought, who she is, may I ask you?"`
	"CN-10104" `	"Oh, I write science fiction novels," replies Anna, only mildly taken aback by the sight of giant beetles.`
	"CN-10105" `	The Kimek begin conversing amongst themselves in their native language for a good ten to twenty seconds before they move to face you again.`
	"CN-10106" `	Then, switching the translation box back on, the Kimek explains that Anna is welcome to be with you, but reminds you that she will not be allowed to do much until she registers with the Heliarchs on the Ring of Friendship.`
	"CN-10107" `	"Okay," says Anna, "I'll explore the spaceport a little bit to find some inspiration. Get your ship ready and meet me there."`
	"CN-10108" `Sorting through messages, you recall that a Kimek named Kachachee and their group wanted a copy of Anna Fangvin's "Beyond the Hyperdrive." You now know her.`
	"CN-10109" `	(Ask Anna for another copy of the book.)`
	"CN-10110" `	(Give Kachachee my copy of the book.)`
	"CN-10111" `	(Forget about it.)`
	"CN-10112" `	You call Anna, and ask her for another copy of Beyond the Hyperdrive for a friend named Kachachee. She says, "Sure, I'll send it to you over the Coalition's incredible hyperspace relays. For something as small as a book, there probably won't even need to be a spaceship bringing it! Where do you want it sent?" You reply, "To <planet>." You should head there to receive it and gift it to Kachachee.`
	"CN-10113" `After receiving the book - it turns out to have gotten there in a normal spacecraft, along with a message from Anna stating her disappointment - you get in contact with Kachachee and inform them you have a copy of "Beyond the Hyperdrive." They respond, telling you to meet them at a public square within the spaceport.`
	"CN-10114" `When you land on <planet>, you get in contact with Kachachee and inform them you have a copy of "Beyond the Hyperdrive." They respond, telling you to meet them at a public square within the spaceport.`
	"CN-10115" `	Walking over to the aforementioned public square, you recognize Kachachee among the crowd. You hold up your copy of Beyond the Hyperdrive and hand it over to them. Kachachee eagerly takes the copy. "Very thankful we are, for this book. Read it with my group, I must. But for your troubles, worthy of <payment>, you are." They then give you a chip and walk away, blending back into the crowd.`
	"CN-10116" `You walk through the spaceport, looking for Anna. You find her in the middle of a public square, seated at a table with her laptop out. You figure she must've intended on getting started on some early work, what with the newly found inspiration of being in such an alien society, but it seems the sheer volume and diversity of peoples here on <origin> made her forget to type entirely.`
	"CN-10117" `	She only seems to notice you when you also sit down beside her. "Oh, hello again, <first>!" she says, snapping back into focus. "Is the ship ready?"`
	"CN-10118" `	Hearing an affirmative answer, Anna stands up from her chair and begins following you to the <ship>. She settles into her bunk as you prepare for the trip to the <destination>.`
	"CN-10119" `As you enter <system>, Anna walks out of her bunk and finds a spot on the side of the bridge, peering into the empty void. "What a massive ringworld!" she exclaims.`
	"CN-10120" `	"It's enormous. They stole it from the Quarg roughly seven thousand years ago."`
	"CN-10121" `	"This is going to be a great source of inspiration for my next novel," says Anna, still in awe. She pulls out a small notebook and begins busily writing in it.`
	"CN-10122" `Anna is amazed as you touch down on the ringworld. As the two of you open the hatch, you see a Heliarch agent in front of you.`
	"CN-10123" `	"Greetings, humans. For you, what can I do today?" asks the Heliarch. You respond that you would like to register Anna with the Heliarchy. Upon reaching the registration office, Anna enters, and fifteen minutes later exits alongside another Heliarch, this time a crowned Saryd. "They finally got all the paperwork done. We're off to the spaceport to get some food. Meet us there to discuss our next move."`
	"CN-10124" `Going through the spaceport looking for Anna, you finally find her at a restaurant, eating a longcow steak and typing something on her laptop. The Heliarch Saryd from earlier stands beside her, bent-over and gesturing at something on the screen. She sees you and motions for you to take a seat.`
	"CN-10125" `	"This meat is so delicious! After months of instant noodles and takeout back home, it finally feels good to eat something that's actually healthy," she exclaims, closing the computer.`
	"CN-10126" `	"How good is it?"`
	"CN-10127" `	"You ate nothing but that!?"`
	"CN-10128" `	"My diet wasn't exactly the best. All I had was carbs and takeout food; I never could find time in my schedule to cook at home. I was working hard on Beyond the Hyperdrive at the time. This food is better than anything I could ever find on Zug.`
	"CN-10129" `	"It's very good. Probably better than anything I've had back on Zug. Now, I'd like to get my book published here."`
	"CN-10130" `	"On another note, I want to get my book published here."`
	"CN-10131" `	"Have you found a publishing company yet?" you ask.`
	"CN-10132" `	"No," Anna replies. "But this Heliarch, Temporo, has been a huge help in finding a suitable publisher. Without them, it would've been nearly impossible for me to communicate with the restaurant staff, since they don't have a translation box."`
	"CN-10133" `	"What's the plan now?"`
	"CN-10134" `	"Did the Heliarch agent mention anywhere we should go now?"`
	"CN-10135" `	"Why does the Heliarchy care about who publishes the book?"`
	"CN-10136" `	The Heliarch straightens up. "Take us to <planet>, you should. Better help there, I can."`
	"CN-10137" `	"Does that sound reasonable to you?" Anna asks. When you reply in the affirmative, she says, "We'll be at your spaceship when you are."`
	"CN-10138" `	"I think Temporo was just trying to be helpful. He hasn't said anything to the contrary."`
	"CN-10139" `As you land, Anna says, "Should we see about getting a translation device? I don't want to bother Temporo the whole time I'm here."`
	"CN-10140" `	Temporo approaches. "Trust you with a translator, the government cannot. So help you, I must. When found a publisher, you have, accompany you to their offices, I will."`
	"CN-10141" `	"We need to find a publishing company then!" says Anna.`
	"CN-10142" `	"The Kimek might be a good choice. They have a high population."`
	"CN-10143" `	"Perhaps the Saryd. They're more culturally similar to humans, so they may be more interested in human books."`
	"CN-10144" `	"The Arachi have a close-knit population. Word of a new book might spread quickly there."`
	"CN-10145" `	"Oh, it's kind of embarrassing but... I'm actually a bit afraid of spiders, so I'm going to take a while to get used to the Arachi."`
	"CN-10146" `	"I thought the same at first, but from what I've seen the Saryds seem pretty reserved, don't you think? Maybe another species would be better."`
	"CN-10147" `	"But where can we find a Kimek publishing company? We haven't even translated our book into their language yet!"`
	"CN-10148" `	"We'll find a company."`
	"CN-10149" `	"Given the number of books here, there has to be a publishing company somewhere."`
	"CN-10150" `	"The faster we can get the book published, the better. Meet me in the spaceport in a few hours; I'll find a good company."`
	"CN-10151" `	Before Anna can head off, Temporo rises. "Again accompany you, I will."`
	"CN-10152" `The spaceport of Ki Patek Ka is vast, and would normally prove a nightmarish place to look for just one person. Thankfully, Anna being the only other human within the Coalition makes your search relatively quick. She has chosen to settle in a cafeteria with her laptop, typing away at the keyboard, presumably writing a short story to post.`
	"CN-10153" `	"<first>! I found a company who's willing to publish me! I sent them a digital copy of my book and they instructed me to visit their office on <planet>," explains Anna, once again enthusiastic. At a table behind her you notice the figure of Temporo, speaking to a waiter.`
	"CN-10154" `	"Great!"`
	"CN-10155" `	"Let's go!"`
	"CN-10156" `	"What's the publishing company called?"`
	"CN-10157" `	"They're called 'Priyepichia Publishing.'" Anna shows you beautiful pictures of a clean white building perched on a mountainside, high above gentle waves. On the roof stands a landing pad painted with a striped, sleek beetle-like creature whose hind legs resemble broad paddles.`
	"CN-10158" `	You head back to your ship with Anna and Temporo, and plot a course to <destination>.`
	"CN-10159" `Landing on <planet>, Anna is excitedly holding a copy of 'Beyond the Hyperdrive.' She hastily opens the hatch as soon as it unlocks.`
	"CN-10160" `	Anna stops, waiting for you to catch up. "In the message they sent me, they included instructions on how to reach their offices," she explains. "Let's go!"`
	"CN-10161" `	Several long streets later, Anna is completely lost. "This isn't where the instructions were supposed to lead at all," she says, turning to Temporo, who has been following you the whole time. "Do you know how to get there?"`
	"CN-10162" `	The Heliarch takes the lead, and within minutes you reach a train station. Once the train arrives, you travel to a neighborhood where a large white building dominates the skyline.`
	"CN-10163" `	Circling around to the publisher's office, you find the entrance bustling with Kimek, along with the occasional Saryd and Arach coming and going. Anna looks for a front desk and directs you to a Kimek who appears to be a receptionist.`
	"CN-10164" `	"Hello, do you happen to know where Priyepichia Publishing is?"`
	"CN-10165" `	"We're looking for a publishing company called Priyepichia Publishing. Could you provide directions?"`
	"CN-10166" `	"On the 16th floor, Priyepichia Publishing is. Over there, the elevators are," says the receptionist's translator.`
	"CN-10167" `	You turn to where the Kimek points you and see six large elevators, larger than what you are familiar with in human space. Temporo leads you to the least crowded one.`
	"CN-10168" `	The three of you enter the elevator. It makes stops at each floor of the building, and the elevator gets quieter as more Kimek reach their destinations. When you reach the 16th floor, the elevator is only half full. The door opens to reveal a Kimek, wearing an ornate jeweled necklace as well as a translation device.`
	"CN-10169" `	(Exit the elevator.)`
	"CN-10170" `	"Greetings, humans. Follow me, you must, so discuss your book, we can," the Kimek says through its translation box.`
	"CN-10171" `	At the direction of the Kimek, you and Anna walk as directed until you arrive at a room with glass walls. Along the way, you pass a lounge, a conference area where multiple Kimek are discussing something at a table with a group of Heliarchs, and a large open workspace where individual Kimek sit at their own computers.`
	"CN-10172" `	After a few minutes of walking, you reach an office where another Kimek sits with a team of Heliarchs. Temporo takes a seat with them, making six - two from each species.`
	"CN-10173" `	The Kimek guiding you gestures toward the office and heads over to speak with the group.`
	"CN-10174" `	As you enter, Anna puts down the copy of her book on the table, and you each take a seat. The Kimek that led you here briefly speaks to the other non-Heliarch Kimek sitting at the interview table before leaving.`
	"CN-10175" `	The sitting Kimek's translation device begins speaking.`
	"CN-10176" `	"Greetings. Ikiyachee, my name is, and head editor of Priyepichia Publishing, I am. To see an alien want to publish a book, interesting and unexpected it was," the Kimek says.`
	"CN-10177" `	"Hello, I am Anna Fangvin, and this is my friend <first> <last>, who has been very helpful in bringing me here," Anna says, somewhat flustered.`
	"CN-10178" `	"From the introduction and the first few pages, interesting your book sounded, but run it past the Heliarch reviewers, we must. So, <first>, long and intensive, this interview will be. As very unique, to meet a human like her is, and to adapt her book to our culture, a long and drawn-out process it will be."`
	"CN-10179" `	"How long will I have to wait?"`
	"CN-10180" `	"Should I stay here to accompany Anna?`
	"CN-10181" `	"Wait a few hours during our preliminary interview, you must.`
	"CN-10182" `	"A few hours? That's quite boring, isn't it?"`
	"CN-10183" `	"Should I stay here to accompany Anna?"`
	"CN-10184" `	"If boring for you, the interview is, then leave you may, to the lounge."`
	"CN-10185" `	"Then I'm going to the lounge. Where is it?"`
	"CN-10186" `	(Accompany Anna during the interview.)`
	"CN-10187" `	Ikiyachee gives you directions to the lounge, and you head there to wait out the interview.`
	"CN-10188" `	"To stay with her during the interview, we allow you to, but a lounge for you, we have. If too boring, the interview is, then leave you may."`
	"CN-10189" `	(Wait in the lounge.)`
	"CN-10190" `	Once the first questions are asked, Anna is all too happy to begin discussing the contents of her novel in great detail.`
	"CN-10191" `	Under the watchful eye of the six Heliarchs in the room, Anna explains her anti-Quarg sentiments, the reasoning behind her choice to write the book, and the content of the book. She speaks quickly, but the Heliarchs' numerous questions for clarification and elaboration make the process a long one.`
	"CN-10192" `	"Sold many books before coming here, have you?" Temporo asks. Anna embarrassedly glances in your direction. "Well, no," she replies. "But I've been writing better and better over the past few years."`
	"CN-10193" `	Priyepichia's representative speaks up. "Word count, we must know. Binding process, aware of you are? What type and cover style, want you?"`
	"CN-10194" `	"The hardcover book should have a jump drive emblazoned on the front cover. I'm not sure the exact options for a binding type in this area of space; couldn't you just decide that yourself?"`
	"CN-10195" `	As you listen, you learn that due to the Coalition's review process to make the book more suitable, Anna will have to stay for about half a year, during which she will have an apartment to live in.`
	"CN-10196" `	"Do I have to stay with Anna here for half a year?"`
	"CN-10197" `	As the hours pass, Anna's enthusiastic tone remains strong and constant. The Kimek then takes the book, puts it in a nearby filing cabinet and thanks the two of you.`
	"CN-10198" `	You leave the interview room, while the Heliarchs stay, presumably to continue speaking with the Kimek. As the two of you walk out, Anna begins to speak.`
	"CN-10199" `	"Required to stay with Anna, you are not, but if you wish to, stay with her you may. Return to human space, you are free to do," says the Kimek.`
	"CN-10200" `	You leave the room and walk to the lounge. There are several tables where many Kimek are chatting in their native language, while a few Saryds and Arachi are visibly relaxed. You sit at an empty table to pass the time, occasionally going to the water dispenser to hydrate yourself.`
	"CN-10201" `	After thirty minutes, a Kimek approaches you. Their translation device speaks. "An alien in our space, you are? Most strange, this meeting truly is. A Coalition member the likes of you, I have never encountered. Or... ahmm... from outside of our space, are you?"`
	"CN-10202" `	"I'd prefer to be left alone right now."`
	"CN-10203" `	"Yes, I am the human <first> <last>. Glad to meet you."`
	"CN-10204" `	"Well, I'm not the only alien."`
	"CN-10205" `	"We call ourselves humans, not aliens."`
	"CN-10206" `	"Same. 'Akacharra', my name is. To our fine neighborhood, for what purpose have you come here?"`
	"CN-10207" `	"I'm helping someone publish a book here," you say. "Her name's Anna Fangvin.`
	"CN-10208" `	"If more of you, here there are, then who are they?"`
	"CN-10209" `	"It's just two; my passenger Anna Fangvin and I. She's publishing a book in your space," you reply.`
	"CN-10210" `	"'Humans', you are? Know that, I never did. For correcting me and educating me on your fellow kind, I am thankful," says the Kimek. "So, the other human, who is she?"`
	"CN-10211" `	"Oh, that's my passenger Anna Fangvin. She's here to publish her book in Coalition space," you answer.`
	"CN-10212" `	"Anna Fangvin, her name is? An interesting name, it is, and her book, just as interesting it will be when it is released. But know the title of the book, I do not, so if tell me you will, appreciate it I will."`
	"CN-10213" `	"It's called 'Beyond the Hyperdrive.' It could very well be years before release, but I'm glad you're taking interest."`
	"CN-10214" `	"It's called 'Beyond the Hyperdrive.' I think it's likely to be one of the best books of all time."`
	"CN-10215" `	"So, 'Beyond the Hyperdrive,' it is, you say? Thankful, I am. On its release, buy the book, I will remember to."`
	"CN-10216" `	The Kimek walks away after the two of you exchange farewells, leaving you to your own devices.`
	"CN-10217" `	"Apologies for invading your personal space, I give." The Kimek quickly walks away.`
	"CN-10218" `	After a few hours, you see Anna enter the lounge and walk toward you. She takes a seat next to you.`
	"CN-10219" `	"How did the interview go?"`
	"CN-10220" `	"They told me that due to the review process to make sure it's suitable, I'll have to wait for roughly half a year. Thankfully, they have arranged a small apartment for me to live in. You can go on your own now, but if you want to return to human space, please remember to come back and meet me here."`
	"CN-10221" `	"Why don't you just go back to human space?"`
	"CN-10222" `	"I'll make sure to do that."`
	"CN-10223" `	"Thanks again, <first> <last>. I'll forever be grateful to you for helping me. I never thought I'd be successful as an author, but when I met you, you helped me turn my career into something I thought I'd never see."`
	"CN-10224" `	"Just helping out."`
	"CN-10225" `	"I'm happy to have helped you."`
	"CN-10226" `	"Again, thank you for all your help."`
	"CN-10227" `	You return to the spaceport the way you came and return to your ship.`
	"CN-10228" `	"I need to stay here so I can answer their questions during the review process. Don't worry about me."`
	"CN-10229" `	"Got it. Good luck publishing your book."`
	"CN-10230" `Checking your computer feed for the latest galactic news and trade prices, you get a reminder.`
	"CN-10231" `	You read it, and recall that you had helped an author named Anna Fangvin get her book, "Beyond the Hyperdrive," published about half a year ago in Coalition space. You should return to <destination> and check on her.`
	"CN-10232" `As you land on the spaceport, you check your messages and see a notification from Anna Fangvin, the author who you helped about half a year ago. In the message, she explains that her novel, "Beyond the Hyperdrive," has been approved. You should return to <destination> and meet her.`
	"CN-10233" `The moment you land, Anna arrives, very happy to see you. She grabs your shoulders with both arms and in an excited tone explains that her book has been approved for publication.`
	"CN-10234" `	"They're publishing Beyond the Hyperdrive today, and there's a full release event where I'll be signing copies! Thanks for everything you've done, <first>! Do you want to join me during the book signing?"`
	"CN-10235" `	"I've been with you through the whole process. Count me in!"`
	"CN-10236" `	"I'd be happy to!"`
	"CN-10237" `	"Great! Let's walk to the bookstore and get ready! The staff have already prepared seats for both of us."`
	"CN-10238" `	You and Anna walk into the massive bookstore at the spaceport. There are already several Heliarchs present, their Enforcer Riot Staffs in place for crowd control.`
	"CN-10239" `	A Kimek, dressed in what looks like the bookstore's uniform, takes out a loudspeaker with multiple handholds and begins announcing the release of Beyond the Hyperdrive. Within minutes, the bookstore has become crowded, with a long queue forming between the cashiers and your table, as Anna signs every copy brought to her.`
	"CN-10240" `	Occasionally, Anna alternates between her left and right hand to sign books whenever the other is tired. For hours, this continues. You tried to keep count of how many copies she signed, but gave up when it reached six hundred.`
	"CN-10241" `	"Are you left- or right-handed?"`
	"CN-10242" `	"I was originally born left-handed, but as a child I chose to learn how to use my right hand, because I thought being able to use both hands would be cool."`
	"CN-10243" `	The signing continues for several more hours. Eventually, the same Kimek in the bookstore uniform announces that the store is closing soon.`
	"CN-10244" `	As the store closes and the queue shortens, Anna signs the last Kimek's copy. With that, the event is over. Anna walks with you back to your ship to say goodbye.`
	"CN-10245" `	"My book succeeded beyond my wildest dreams, and it was all because of you, <first>!" she says, almost in a teary voice. She pulls out a credit chip. "Here, <payment>. You've done so much for me and my career, and you deserve it."`
	"CN-10246" `	Anna then takes out another copy of Beyond the Hyperdrive, which she signs in front of you. It is the Coalition edition of the book, but translated to your language. Quickly reading through it, you realize that the book has been significantly altered from the version you read in human space. "Here, take it. A special copy just for you, as a thank you for all you've done."`
	"CN-10247" `	"Why is this book so different from the one in human space?"`
	"CN-10248" `	"Did you make any changes to it?"`
	"CN-10249" `	"Well, for one, it's not in our language. Some concepts just don't translate very well, so I tried to capture the spirit of the story. The Heliarch linguists were very helpful," she explains. "They really went into depth on some aspects of the Coalition's languages. None of the major plot points were changed, thankfully, though some content in the book had to be edited or removed. My Heliarch friend said that if I changed this or removed that, the book would sell so much better, and as they said, they wanted to 'make it more suitable for the Coalition.' Their words.`
	"CN-10250" `	"As for the special copy, it was so I could verify and look at the changes they made, in my language, so I wouldn't have to learn their language. They agreed to print another copy for me so I could give it to you."`
	"CN-10251" `	Anna checks a wristwatch that she didn't have when you first met. "Wow, it looks like people have already started reviewing the book, and they're giving great feedback! I've got to go now; I want to see in person how well my book is selling. Goodbye!"`
	"CN-10252" `	Anna then leaves your ship, leaving you with a novel, a payment, and the knowledge that you've helped a struggling author make it big.`
	"CN-10253" `	Anna looks disappointed, but the emotion quickly disappears in her flood of exuberence. She dashes off in the direction she came in.`
	"CN-10254" `You are shocked to see an extra <payment> in your account. Checking your messages you spot a notification from Anna, the author whose book Beyond the Hyperdrive was published in Coalition space a few months ago. She explains that the book has been selling very well in Coalition space and sends an expression of gratitude. Given the <payment> you received this is likely an understatement.`
	"CN-10255" `After the latest report on how the Heliarchs arrested some terrorists on a nearby world, the news shows various short clips with the same message, asking the public to "stay vigilant" and report any and all suspicious activity.`
	"CN-10256" `"Caring for longcows, hard work it is. Too much space they take up. Too many legs."`
	"CN-10257" `"Never been around an angry longcow, have you? Word of advice, avoid their sides you should."`
	"CN-10258" `"Stopped using vaccines on longcows, long ago we did. Remember which leg to apply them on, we never could."`
	"CN-10259" `"Wish understand my jokes, my beauties could. Many kicks out of them, they would get."`
	"CN-10260" `"Fresh steak here! First leg steak, second leg steak... a discount for tenth leg steak there is!"`
	"CN-10261" `"When starting out on this business, I was, lost in the farm I got. Tricky to tell where you are, it is, when green is all you see."`
	"CN-10262" `"A Heliarch agent, I once was. Too stressful, it was for me, so this job I took. Messages from colleagues, I still get, but if see the fruits I plant here, they could, definitely join me, they would."`
	"CN-10263" `"Some fresh produce would you like, Captain? If purchase these, you do, teach you a family recipe I could. I'm sure that love it, a human would. Probably."`
	"CN-10264" `Dozens of farmers in different stands call out to you as you walk by the spaceport, asking you to take a look at the special prices of today's "food expo." You later look into it, and turns out yesterday there also was an expo, as well as the day before that. Tomorrow's starts the moment today's ends.`
	"CN-10265" `"Protect and serve."`
	"CN-10266" `"If any assistance you need, at your disposal I am."`
	"CN-10267" `"If any trouble you find, report it to us you must."`
	"CN-10268" `"Saryd, Kimek, Arach, human, no matter what species, to protect all of our citizens, committed we are."`
	"CN-10269" `"Enjoy my post well enough, I do, but still to get a break during the Coalition Games to watch them, I am."`
	"CN-10270" `"Part of a Punisher crew, I am. Land, refuel, rest, and back to working on that magnificent ship, I do!"`
	"CN-10271" `"Offered the position of magister, I actually have been. Only, not interested in that governing activity, I am."`
	"CN-10272" `"Apologies, but make haste I must. Gone missing some garrison guns have, and back to cleaning Stalker engines I will be, if find them I don't!"`
	"CN-10273" `"Difficult sometimes it is, to be a mediator. If careful with my words I am not, a Saryd might think an Arach talking about longcows has insulted their mother."`
	"CN-10274" `"A pilot, I once was. Learned from an older sibling, I did."`
	"CN-10275" `"Seen those charity workers in blue on some of our worlds, have you? Noble intentions they may have, but understand it I do not. Why trouble themselves with it when taking care of everyone, we already are?"`
	"CN-10276" `"Laws, history, theory, too much of it I have read, and still behind I am..."`
	"CN-10277" `"As part of my trials, read the works of consul Aulori, I had to. Exceeded my expectations, his books have."`
	"CN-10278" `"Meant to prove our dedication and show our potential, the trials we candidates go through are. Though difficult, we're sure to be apt to serve once passed, we have."`
	"CN-10279" `"Ever since another child I had, extended my vacation period and increased my holiday pay, the government has."`
	"CN-10280" `"Much better than I expected, the food here is. Still, beat longcow steak, nothing here does."`
	"CN-10281" `"That the streets here were too narrow for us Arachi, I had heard, but no problem so far I've had."`
	"CN-10282" `"Come here with a caravan, I have. Cheaper it was, but stick together we must, and too tight the schedule they set up is. Barely appreciate the sights, I can!"`
	"CN-10283" `"Asked me to bring them some gifts from my trip, my family has, but fit them all in my luggage I cannot, and only half of the gifts purchased I have!"`
	"CN-10284" `"From an arcology I am, so to me twice the vacation, a trip to a planet without them is."`
	"CN-10285" `"From far away I've come, and for weeks sleeping in a ship I was. My first time traveling to another planet, it is, so not used to being so far from nature, I was. No idea how other Saryds make it as pilots, I have."`
	"CN-10286" `"Truly breathtaking, the sights of this world are. The cuisine, too, greatly enjoyed I have. If only the locals had a more civil sense of attire."`
	"CN-10287" `"Climb up walls, the denizens of this world can. Otherworldly it is, to see them do so in the distinct architecture of some buildings here."`
	"CN-10288" `"Pardon me, but providing me with a blood sample, would you mind? Interested in how the human immune system differs from our own, I am."`
	"CN-10289" `"To Ring of Wisdom I frequently travel. Held there, many great conferences are."`
	"CN-10290" `"Move to Ring of Wisdom, I wish to. So many advanced facilities for testing it has, so much easier to get a hold of complex chemicals..."`
	"CN-10291" `"A Saryd Traveler I recently purchased. Not much of a pilot I am, but being a science vessel, adequate facilities the model still has. More importantly, no rude neighbors to interrupt my team's research, a spaceship has."`
	"CN-10292" `A Saryd engrossed in a tablet displayed strange characters almost walks into you. "Excuse me," they mutter before continuing on their way.`
	"CN-10293" `"A lecture in nanotechnology, I am here to present. Unclear on whether I would be teaching faculty or students, the invitation was."`
	"CN-10294" `"Earned a degree in xenobiology, I did some time ago. Under a top researcher in the field, I work now."`
	"CN-10295" `"Seems that interesting findings, the research on yottrite has yielded. Proud of having helped us learn more, you should be."`
	"CN-10296" `"Now that more information on yottrite we have, wonder if House Ablomab will ask for samples to experiment on, I do."`
	"CN-10297" `"Kill for the papers on the yottrite research, I would, but still confidential the information is."`
	"CN-10298" `"Just arrived here, I have. So glad that finally accepted for this job, I was!"`
	"CN-10299" `"Food, lodging, an important job with a good pay, and a wonderful view. Ask for, what more could I?"`
	"CN-10300" `"The means to finish construction of the two remaining rings, we still don't have, but one day, complete they shall be."`
	"CN-10301" `"Wholly safe, our Coalition is, but here, even safer I feel. What is there to fear, when in an indestructible station you are?"`
	"CN-10302" `"Still researching the alloys that make up the rings, our top scientists are, so only adding supplementary solar panels, we are."`
	"CN-10303" `"Friend, please step aside." A Kimek gestures to a large cart filled with tools and equipment, and you move to let them pass.`
	"CN-10304" `"Since with captains of other species, we deal, translation boxes, we are issued. Simple tools for us, but too expensive for many to purchase, they are, so to enjoy the opportunity to use them, we try."`
	"CN-10305" `"Three different styles of ships, we deal with daily, so never on autopilot we can be, or else refuel one incorrectly, we might."`
	"CN-10306" `"Inspect every crate before it is put on a ship, the Heliarchs do. A tedious process, it is."`
	"CN-10307" `"Enough money for my first ship, I didn't have, so split the cost of a Runabout, me and an online friend did. Picked another ship, we should have, because too difficult flying alone to their planet, it was."`
	"CN-10308" `"Enough money for my first ship, I didn't have, so a loan from House Plumtab, I took. Read the interest rates a bit better, I should have..."`
	"CN-10309" `"On a Hulk, my first job in a spaceship was. Thought falling apart it was, I had, when to a Spindle it switched."`
	"CN-10310" `"Liked my ship so much, a Kimek passenger did, that decided to live in it, they have. For 'transport' they still pay, so mind it I do not."`
	"CN-10311" `"Jealous of you, I am. If a jump drive I had, bypass the gap between Saryd and Arach space, I could, and quickly earn a fortune, I would."`
	"CN-10312" `"Agreed to transport some Saryd graduates for a 'field trip,' I once did. Almost arrested, I was."`
	"CN-10313" `"Used to fly with me, my brother did, but now become a Heliarch, he has."`
	"CN-10314" `"Arrested close to where my cousins work, the terrorists on the news were. Notice anything wrong with them, they never did."`
	"CN-10315" `"Always rising, the sun in these broadcasts is, but a night shift I work, so see it for myself, I never can..."`
	"CN-10316" `"To Ring of Wisdom, a researcher friend of mine has gone. Always there, our wisest mingle, but remain here, few do. Difficult for us, sometimes it is."`
	"CN-10317" `"Always mixing up our Houses, Kimek and Saryd tourists are. Mind it, I do not, but angry, sometimes my friends get."`
	"CN-10318" `"Learnt my language, some Kimek friends have, but so fast they speak, that difficult to understand them, it is."`
	"CN-10319" `"Tired of dealing with faulty translation boxes, my sister got, so learning to speak Arachi, she is."`
	"CN-10320" `"Much more reserved than us, the Saryds are. So long do they live for, that difficult to understand their habits, it can be."`
	"CN-10321" `"Troubling it is, when their children, Kimek and Arach tourists bring. Climb up everywhere, they try."`
	"CN-10322" `"Travel to new places, I used to, but infinite, our planets are not, so seen them all by now I have."`
	"CN-10323" `"Purchase some Saryd cakes, would you like to? Homemade, they are."`
	"CN-10324" `"Interested in this tapestry, are you? Of the finest longcow hide, it is made. A special discount, for you I could make."`
	"CN-10325" `"Interested in these ringworld keychains, are you? For you, only 30 credits!"`
	"CN-10326" `"Caught your eye, this necklace has? Real hedgelion quills, these are. Great luck, they bring, for those generous enough to make a purchase."`
	"CN-10327" `"Arcology miniatures? Arachi armor replicas? Multipurpose gardening tools? For all of those and more, the best prices I have!"`
	"CN-10328" `"Heard, I have, that come back from the outside, that Heliarch tribune did. Very lucky, she must be."`
	"CN-10329" `"Heard, I have, that come back from the outside, that Heliarch girl did. If you ask me, a lie that she ever left, it is."`
	"CN-10330" `"Seen the news, have you? Returned from the outside, a Saryd Heliarch has! Wonder how bad it was out there, I do."`
	"CN-10331" `"The one that helped that Heliarch inspector in her expedition, you are. A very strong ship, you must have, if made it back, you two did."`
	"CN-10332" `"Helped that Heliarch inspector come back from the outside, you have. Always thought that impossible, I did."`
	"CN-10333" `"Promoted to the rank of arbiter after her expedition, that Saryd inspector was. Very impressed by her findings on the outside, the consuls must have been."`
	"CN-10334" `"Promoted to the rank of arbiter after her 'expedition,' that Saryd girl was, but what proof of her actually leaving do we have? Stupid enough to have tried that, nobody is."`
	"CN-10335" `"Though a success, that Saryd inspector's expedition was, turned many of the consuls furious at one another, her return has. Expected her to make it back, many of them had not."`
	"CN-10336" `"Our thanks for helping inspector Sedlitaris, you have. Finally found their way back, the last expedition's reports have."`
	"CN-10337" `"The one who helped inspector Sedlitaris on her expedition you are, correct? Read her report on it, I have. Disconcerting, the fate of the last expedition is, but at least recovered their findings, we now have."`
	"CN-10338" `"Going to see the Coalition Games, I am. Our biggest yearly event, it is."`
	"CN-10339" `"Competing in the Coalition Games this year, a friend of mine is. Cheering for them, my whole family is."`
	"CN-10340" `"Seen the latest transmission of the Coalition Games, have you? Throughout it all, on the edge I was!"`
	"CN-10341" `"Checked the job board lately, have you? Eager to see the Coalition Games, tons of passengers are. A good season for business, this is."`
	"CN-10342" `"Watching the Coalition Games transmissions lately, I have been. Tried to become an athlete myself, I once did, but too rigorous, their training routine is! Made me appreciate the sports more, it has."`
	"CN-10343" `"Just arrived from my first live viewing of the Coalition Games, I have. An incredible experience, it was. Go again next year, I for sure will!"`
	"CN-10344" `"Heading to the Coalition Games, are you? If so, forgive us you must. Some trouble with organizing the crowds this morning, there was, so delayed by five minutes, the whole line is."`
	"CN-10345" `"A former athlete myself, I am. Earned my rank by winning in the Games, I did, so always eager to help organize the event, I am."`
	"CN-10346" `"Brought my children to see the Games, I have. An important part of our culture, the Games are, so glad to share the experience with them, I am."`
	"CN-10347" `"Brought my children to see the Games, I have. Hope I do, that behave themselves this time, they will..."`
	"CN-10348" `"Here for the Games too, are you? The largest event in all the Coalition, it is. Come here to watch every year, I do!"`
	"CN-10349" `"Come to watch a relative of mine compete, I have. Training hard for many years, they have been, so sure I am that do well, they will."`
	"CN-10350" `So great, this 'Beyond the Hyperdrive' book is! Read it, I have!`
	"CN-10351" `Read from a human, I never have, but when Anna Fangvin, I found, buy her book I did!`
	"CN-10352" `Very nice, Anna Fangvin was, for sign my book, she did with much joy!`
	"CN-10353" `Read all of 'Beyond the Hyperdrive', I did! Inspired by those who stole from our oppressors, I was!`
	"CN-10354" `"Help bring amenity goods and services to those who can't afford them, we do. Operate mostly in Kimek space we do, if interested in helping you are."`
	"CN-10355" `"Interested in contributing to the charity, are you? Take every sort of donation, we do. Credits, winter supplies, trinkets, old tech devices. Whatever it is, if willing to donate you are, drop them here you can."`
	"CN-10356" `"Just finished filling up an entire Arach fleet's cargo holds with school supplies, we have. Very tiring, the job is, but glad I am that making a difference, our charity efforts are."`
	"CN-10357" `"Get most of our funding from some of the Arach Houses and rich Saryd families, we do. Meant only to acquire part of the charity goods and the means to transport them, the credits are, for voluntary work, this is."`
	"CN-10358" `Standing by the spaceport entrance, a worker is distributing flyers to those who come in and out. "Hello human visitor. Part of a charity group, I am, raising awareness to our cause. Aware were you, that lack the electronics for many educational activities, children on poor Kimek worlds do? Together, make a difference we can!"`
	"CN-10359" `A few minutes into browsing the local shops, you hear the strong sound of Saryd hooves approaching, and turn to see a trio of Heliarch agents hurrying toward you. They briefly salute you before stating their business.`
	"CN-10360" `	"Looking for work, the human visitor is?" the Saryd asks.`
	"CN-10361" `	"To the <destination>, a means of transport we need," the Kimek follows.`
	"CN-10362" `	"<payment>, we can offer. And, perhaps, some more interesting work after our destination, we reach," the Arach finishes.`
	"CN-10363" `	"Of course, I'll show you to my ship."`
	"CN-10364" `	"Sorry, I'm not looking for any work currently."`
	"CN-10365" `	They thank you for agreeing to deliver them to the <planet>, and introduce themselves; the Saryd is called Iplora, the Kimek is Kirrie, and the Arach is known as Tugroob. You help them settle in their bunks, wondering why they seemed so rushed.`
	"CN-10366" `The three Heliarchs disembark and head immediately toward the spaceport, but not before Iplora hands you <payment>. "Speak with our superior, we must. Need your services again, we likely will, so if interested in further work, you are, look for us in the spaceport, you should." She bows her head lightly, and follows her colleagues into one of the Heliarch-only sections of the ring.`
	"CN-10367" `You find the trio of Heliarch agents, Iplora, Kirrie and Tugroob, waiting for you in the spaceport. They greet you, and Iplora speaks for the trio. "Accompany us now, could you? A job in mind for you, our superior has."`
	"CN-10368" `	"I don't see why not. Lead the way."`
	"CN-10369" `	"Sorry, but I'm not interested in helping any more."`
	"CN-10370" `	The three of them escort you through a number of restricted passageways dotted with armed, statue-like guards at every door and hallway you pass through. Eventually you reach a meeting room of sorts, with about a dozen other Heliarchs seated at the central table. One of them motions for you to join them.`
	"CN-10371" `	As you take a seat, one of the Kimek speaks. "The honorable Captain, we salute. Make you feel welcome, I, Consul Iekie of the Heliarch council, hope we will."`
	"CN-10372" `	"Thank you. The honor's all mine."`
	"CN-10373" `	"Are you the one that has a job for me?"`
	"CN-10374" `	"Stable and safe, our great Coalition is. Sadly, there are some who ideas of revolt and rebellion spread," she says. "To combat these thoughts of disunion, we swore. Correct such behavior, we must," she says as she points to the three agents beside you. "Dedicated to that, our agents are, but oftentimes slow and predictable, their tactics are. A different approach might be due, so an outsider's help, and their way of thinking, we'd like to ask for."`
	"CN-10375" `	"What exactly would I have to do?"`
	"CN-10376" `	"Revolt? Rebellion? What are you talking about?"`
	"CN-10377" `	"In that case, I'm not interested. I thought this was some simple job, not a political matter."`
	"CN-10378" `	"Though to guard our Coalition from the Quarg and all who would see it harmed, steadfast and ever-ready we for millennia have remained, not as disciplined and understanding of the situation, our civilians are," Iekie explains. "For a few centuries now, plagued our Coalition with increasing violence and threats to our people, bands of thieves and terrorist groups have. Stealing Heliarch equipment, promoting rebellious propaganda, attacking Heliarch officials and sites, disrupting our peace with bombings and attacks, intensified all their activities as of late, they have."`
	"CN-10379" `	"Well, what do you think I can do to help?"`
	"CN-10380" `	"Why are they doing all that?"`
	"CN-10381" `	"Uncertain to us, that still remains. Those that arrested and interrogated, we have, no more than simple pawns in the outlaw organizations appear to be." she considers her words for a few seconds. "Warning our civilians about the thugs' actions, we have been, and asking them for support with any information of suspicious activity. Investigate reports of such activity, what you can help us with is."`
	"CN-10382" `	"Six worlds, we have marked. Each, we'd like you to 'visit.' Those three tourists, you will be transporting," an Arach says as they point to Iplora, Kirrie and Tugroob.`
	"CN-10383" `	"Sounds easy enough. Where should I start?"`
	"CN-10384" `	"Whether they go undercover or not, this seems a bit risky for me. Sorry, you'll have to find someone else."`
	"CN-10385" `	"Decide the order of your visits, you will, Captain," Iekie responds. "Shameful to admit this, it is, but known to these outlaws, many of our methods are. Failed in similar operations before, we have, so fear I do, that easily predicted, our own ordering would be."`
	"CN-10386" `	Some of the others brief you on the worlds where suspicious activity has been reported: Shifting Sand in Saryd space, Into White, Fourth Shadow and Remote Blue in Kimek space, and Mebla's Portion and Stronghold of Flugbu in Arach space.`
	"CN-10387" `	They wish the four of you good luck, and have you escorted back to the spaceport. The Heliarch trio arrives at your ship a few minutes later, out of uniform and with heavy luggage. You show the <bunks> 'tourists' to their bunks, and head to your cockpit to decide which of the six worlds you'll head to first.`
	"CN-10388" `When you and the agents leave your ship, you're greeted by about a dozen Heliarch guards, who urge you to follow them into the restricted portions of the ring. You're once again guided through the halls, until you're met by Consul Iekie and her delegation. She approaches you first, handing you <payment>. "Welcome back, Captain <last>. Glad, we all are, that made it back safely, you all have. Trust, I do, that fruitful in learning more of these criminals, your efforts have been?" She looks to the agents you transported.`
	"CN-10389" `	"Unearthed some useful information, we have," Tugroob tells her as he delivers the agents' reports. "Essential to the mission's success, Captain <last>'s cooperativeness was."`
	"CN-10390" `	She nods, as she hands the data to one of the Heliarchs behind her, who immediately move to start analyzing the findings. "Eager to read on the progress made, I am."`
	"CN-10391" `	Iekie thanks you for your efforts in the operation, and goes to analyze the findings with her team. Iplora, Kirrie and Tugroob remain there with them, and you're escorted back to your ships by the guards.`
	"CN-10392" `	The agents then get closer to her, and Kirrie whispers something to the consul, handing her another report. Iekie turns to you once more, saying, "Quite a find, this is. Done well, you have, Captain."`
	"CN-10393" `	The agents then get closer to her, and Kirrie whispers something to the consul, handing her two more reports. Iekie turns to you once more, saying, "Most useful to our investigation, these findings will prove. Excellent work, Captain."`
	"CN-10394" `	The agents then get closer to her, and Kirrie whispers something to the consul, handing her three more reports. Iekie turns to you once more, saying, "Enviable, your prowess at investigation is, <last>. Outstanding work, Captain."`
	"CN-10395" `You receive a message from the Heliarch Consul Iekie as you go in for a landing. "Captain <last>! Analyzed your findings, we have. Brought light to some stolen equipment, your aid has, and for that, grateful we are. Sending a monetary bonus as thanks, I am."`
	"CN-10396" `	When she finishes, <payment> are transferred to your account.`
	"CN-10397" `You receive a message from the Heliarch consul Iekie as you go in for a landing. "Captain <last>! Analyzed your findings, we have. A great boon, your assistance was; located two stashes of our stolen equipment, we have. Investigating who was involved in such operations, my teams are. Very grateful for your help, we are, so sending a monetary bonus as thanks, I am."`
	"CN-10398" `You receive a message from the Heliarch Consul Iekie as you go in for a landing. "Captain <last>! Analyzed your findings, we have. Worry me greatly, all these stashes of stolen equipment do. Indebted to you, we are, as without your help, found all these operations, we would not have. A monetary bonus, as thanks, I am sending. Deserve it, you do, Captain."`
	"CN-10399" `You arrive to a thunderstorm, as is often the norm for <planet>, and the agents go over their plans on how to best investigate the planet.`
	"CN-10400" `	Tugroob suggests that he pose as an Arach writer looking to find housing on the planet and scurries off to what must be a real estate office. Iplora continues with the original idea of pretending to be a tourist, saying that she will ask the young local Arachi about rumors while walking around the city, hoping to find something of use.`
	"CN-10401" `	The two of them leave, and you are left with Kirrie, who has been mostly silent as his friends left your ship.`
	"CN-10402" `	"Are you not going to follow their lead?"`
	"CN-10403" `	"Have you not decided how to investigate the planet?"`
	"CN-10404" `	"Captain <last>. An edge, your human approach to these missions would give us, the consul said. Except underused, your foreign ideas are, if only the order at which we land on these planets, they are used for."`
	"CN-10405" `	He looks out to the rainy spaceport through your hatch, still open from his friends' exits. "Lead the way, would you? The warehouses, I wish to inspect, but your assistance I could use."`
	"CN-10406" `	"Of course, I'll get my rain coat."`
	"CN-10407" `	"I'd rather not go out there with that rain."`
	"CN-10408" `	You walk in a straight line for about an hour, occasionally being hit by splintering rain drops despite the cover provided by buildings and local structures. Kirrie takes you to the very edge of the town where you would be able to see the hills and mountains in the distance, were it not for the colossal rain clouds and constant downpour. One or two warehouses have a fair bit of rust on their doors, and just once you spot one with a damaged roof. You can also make out the shapes of small trees and bushes not too far out.`
	"CN-10409" `	"Now, Captain, start looking for something suspicious, where would you?"`
	"CN-10410" `	(Check the warehouses with the rusty doors.)`
	"CN-10411" `	(Check the warehouse with the leaking roof.)`
	"CN-10412" `	(Go further out and check the trees and bushes.)`
	"CN-10413" `	Kirrie approaches the door, and it opens without him so much as touching it. Unfortunately the warehouse turns out to contain nothing of any significance. It's storage for what Kirrie says are toy parts: just mountains of plastic stacked together. You check a few more warehouses like this, but none turn out to have anything. The rain is starting to get heavier.`
	"CN-10414" `	(Check the warehouse with the leaky roof now.)`
	"CN-10415" `	(Leave the rest of this to Kirrie.)`
	"CN-10416" `	You apologize and tell Kirrie that you don't know what to do next. While he does agree to do it himself, he never stops asking for your opinion on his choices.`
	"CN-10417" `	You spend a few more hours looking around until the rain and the wind get too dangerous for you to be moving from warehouse to warehouse. You both take shelter in one of them until the weather settles. Once it does, it is nearly nightfall, and Kirrie is notified by Iplora that she and Tugroob are already back at the ship. You two decide to head back as well.`
	"CN-10418" `	It seems Tugroob found some evidence of some smuggled weapons passing through here, but nothing major. Exhausted, the Heliarchs get back in their bunks, asking you to depart the planet.`
	"CN-10419" `	Kirrie approaches the door and waits for a few seconds, as if expecting it to open. When it doesn't, he picks his headpiece off and fiddles with it briefly. He puts it on again and waits some more, again to no avail. "To all of these warehouses I should have access. Damaged, the door's electronics don't seem to be," he comments. He then asks you for help, looking for any manner of tools nearby so that you can force the door, while he tries to tinker with the lock. You find something akin to a crowbar, or perhaps a shovel, and bring it to him, and with some effort you two manage to angle it and pull it to pop the door open.`
	"CN-10420" `	At first glance there is nothing inside, but after he thoroughly crawls all over the place, he puts his head to a large metal panel on the opposite end of the room. You approach him, and again you two use the tool to bust the lock open, finding a hidden staircase leading underground.`
	"CN-10421" `	On your way down, Kirrie yells for you to take cover, and you barely escape a barrage of shots as you head back up. Kirrie isn't as lucky, as a shot hit one of his back legs just before he gets to the stairs. You go to help him up before any more shots come, but he seems to make do with five good legs well enough.`
	"CN-10422" `	You two rush back up. Kirrie tells you to be alert and watch the staircase, as he reaches for a small radio-like device to call for support. A few minutes later, a pair of Heliarch Punishers land nearby. Dozens of armed agents enter the warehouse, while you head to one of the ships with Kirrie and wait as his wound is treated.`
	"CN-10423" `	The agents return hours later, reporting they shot down the turrets and found the place deserted. "Many automated production lines, we found," one of them tells Kirrie. "Powering them, one of our Reactor Modules is."`
	"CN-10424" `	Once the local Heliarchs have the situation under control, they have a Breacher come in to pick you two up. It drops you and Kirrie closer to the <ship>, where you find Iplora and Tugroob already waiting. Kirrie suggests you depart once you all head inside, as his colleagues follow him to his bunk to hear what happened.`
	"CN-10425" `	You suggest looking for something unusual near the plant life you spotted while the rain is still fairly tame, and he follows you. You spend a few minutes looking around the trees but find nothing suspicious.`
	"CN-10426" `	While passing by another set of bushes, Kirrie notices that some of them are awkwardly tilted. Upon further inspection, he tells you that they appear to have been removed and then hastily replanted, noting the odd wavy patterns of the small rocks around the roots. The rain has gotten heavier.`
	"CN-10427" `	(Dig out the bushes.)`
	"CN-10428" `	(Head back to the warehouses and look around there.)`
	"CN-10429" `	You help him unearth the bushes and dig a bit more to see if there's anything under them, but you never find anything. You find some other suspicious sets of bushes, but none have anything underneath. The rain and wind become too intense to stay outside, so you head inside a warehouse and take shelter there.`
	"CN-10430" `	Once the weather settles near nightfall, Iplora notifies him that she and Tugroob are already back at the ship, so you two decide to return as well.`
	"CN-10431" `	It seems Tugroob found some evidence of some smuggled weapons passing through here, but nothing major. They get back in their bunks, allowing you to depart.`
	"CN-10432" `	Though he wanted to try digging them out, you convince Kirrie to leave the bushes alone, and you two head back to the empty streets surrounded by the warehouses. You can barely differentiate the warehouses from earlier as the rain gets even heavier.`
	"CN-10433" `	(Check the warehouse with the leaky roof.)`
	"CN-10434" `	Kirrie approaches the door, and it opens without him as much as touching it. Unfortunately the warehouse turns out to contain nothing of any significance. It's storage for what Kirrie says are toy parts: just mountains of plastic stacked together. You check a few more like this but none turn out to have anything, and as the rain and wind become too much to walk through, you take shelter in one of the warehouses.`
	"CN-10435" `	(Head back to the open warehouses and take shelter there.)`
	"CN-10436" `	Though you can barely hear each other in the rain, Kirrie insists on staying there and digging through the ground for a while to see if he can find anything.`
	"CN-10437" `	You walk back to the empty streets, taking care to not slip on the damp soil. You enter one of the warehouses Kirrie had previously opened and are soon joined by him. He informs you that he dug out the suspicious bushes but couldn't find anything under them.`
	"CN-10438" `	Kirrie leaves you behind and you sit there on your own for a number of hours. Eventually, the trio returns, revealing that only Tugroob had found evidence of illegal activity - smuggled weapons passing through the planet.`
	"CN-10439" `	The three agents get back in their bunks and suggest that you depart as soon as possible.`
	"CN-10440" `While you doubt anyone opposing the Heliarchs would find much success operating in this massive compound, it seems the strategic location held by the planet, the volume of resources invested, the fortifications available, and the sheer number of ships stationed here had it marked for investigation anyway.`
	"CN-10441" `	The three agents inform you that you're not allowed to enter most parts of the compound they will be headed to, so you stay inside your ship. They return right at sunset, telling you they found nothing worthwhile. "As expected," Kirrie comments with a sigh. They tell you they're ready to leave, and head to their bunks.`
	"CN-10442" `Iplora leaves the ship immediately, disappearing into the spaceport. Tugroob and Kirrie say that she is heading to a nearby oasis.`
	"CN-10443" `	"Like to connect with nature, the Saryds do. Hoping to hear rumors from the others there, she is," Kirrie explains as he also prepares to leave, claiming to know a few Heliarchs stationed here who could help him look into some reports of a local smuggler's base.`
	"CN-10444" `	Being the last Heliarch agent in your ship, Tugroob turns to you and asks, "Assist me in my search, would you, Captain?"`
	"CN-10445" `	"Sorry, I'll have to refuse this time."`
	"CN-10446" `	"An abandoned mining operation, our target is. Received we have reports of suspicious activity near the complex - recently headed there some ships were, even though shut down for years the mine has been," he explains. You input the coordinates he gives you into your navigator.`
	"CN-10447" `	You come to the remains of a gargantuan mining operation, an enormous hole torn into the planet's crust, spiralling down to what must be nearly a kilometer below the otherwise relatively untouched surface. Near the edge, you spot a medium-sized building, made up of a few interconnected blocks and dirtied up by the planet's sand. Tugroob tells you it must have been the base for the mine workers and managing team when the mine was active.`
	"CN-10448" `	Close to the building, farther out from the digging hole, you see a few landing pads of large enough size for even the bulkiest of freighters, likely once used by spacecraft that would ship the raw ore off to smelting facilities. You land on one of them, and you and Tugroob leave your ship. As you step off the landing pad, Tugroob calls your attention to a desert storm brewing in the distance, and says you two should get started before it reaches here.`
	"CN-10449" `	"Let's check out the building."`
	"CN-10450" `	"Maybe we should try heading down the mining hole."`
	"CN-10451" `	Having been left alone for years, the base for the mining operation no longer has any power. Tugroob has to force the door, gripping the walls and pulling hard with his front legs until it slides open.`
	"CN-10452" `	The place is surprisingly tidy, if dusty near the door with what sand has been let in. Despite the relative cleanliness, it's evident that the previous owners didn't bother cleaning out before packing up and leaving. Various cabinets, archives and work stations dominate the initial room, and you can see it connects to a collective bedroom, filled with bunks and a storage area.`
	"CN-10453" `	"No other entrances there seem to be. If hiding anything here, others were, force their way in they had to, just like us," Tugroob says.`
	"CN-10454" `	"Doesn't look like anyone's been in here in a while. Let's check the mining hole."`
	"CN-10455" `	"There might be something hidden here. Let's look around."`
	"CN-10456" `	You two go about checking every drawer, archive and boxes of all sizes in the first room, but only end up finding a few scattered documents related to the mine, and some old doodles made by what must have been very bored workers. Tugroob tries to get the computers on, but no manner of tinkering brings any electricity to them. The building really is completely out of power.`
	"CN-10457" `	"Find nothing here we will, Captain," Tugroob says, looking out the door at the approaching sandstorm.`
	"CN-10458" `	"Sorry, let's go outside and check that hole while we can."`
	"CN-10459" `	"Hold on. Let's try the other rooms."`
	"CN-10460" `	You head to the dormitories while Tugroob quickly works his way through what remains in the storage. You check under and over all the beds, looking for anything that might be out of the ordinary, but find nothing. The bedroom leads to two larger modules of the building: one for the restrooms, and the other for a dining area, but after searching these areas you again emerge empty-handed.`
	"CN-10461" `	Tugroob comes to meet you, having finished with the storage, and reporting that he too found nothing of note. You two try to leave, but the storm has finally arrived, and so you decide to wait it out inside.`
	"CN-10462" `	You two begin your descent down the mine, but with a step outside it's clear the storm's caught up to you. You still attempt to move to the hole, but the raging sand makes it too difficult to even find a way to start heading down safely. You two head back inside to wait for better visibility.`
	"CN-10463" `	You two approach the hole, and finding one of the many ramps leading down the spiral, carefully make your way down. You pass by some large mining vehicles, akin to very large trucks with thick tracks instead of wheels, and many bores and drills at the front. Tugroob explains they are used to open up tunnels that extend outwards from the main dig hole, to reach lesser mineral deposits without needing to excavate needlessly.`
	"CN-10464" `	Continuing on your way down, he points to some of the holes made by the machines, and to many more vehicles near the bottom.`
	"CN-10465" `	(Keep going down.)`
	"CN-10466" `	(Investigate the nearby vehicles and tunnels.)`
	"CN-10467" `	You two speed up as you continue plunging down the mine, and as you're about a quarter of the way down you can see the bottom more clearly. Over the years, it seems the local storms have been filling it up with sand, and with the operation inactive, nobody's bothered clearing it out. The sand's not enough to have reached the larger mining machines, but you suspect even they'll be covered completely in the coming years.`
	"CN-10468" `	Tugroob stops you at one point, taking your attention to the top of the hole. The clear sky is growing darker, and you can see the wind picking up and launching some smaller rocks down. "Much time we have not, Captain. Search we cannot amidst a sandstorm, and reach in time the bottom we will not."`
	"CN-10469" `	(Try and investigate the vehicles and tunnels to the sides instead.)`
	"CN-10470" `	(Head back up and investigate the building.)`
	"CN-10471" `	You two rush back up. Tugroob helps you save some time by climbing one of the walls straight up as you cling to him, rather than following the spiraling ramps. You reach the building a few minutes before the storm engulfs it and covers the dig hole completely. As it has no power, Tugroob has to force the door open, gripping to the walls and pulling hard with his front legs until it slides open.`
	"CN-10472" `	Given the storm's trapped you in, you two turn over every drawer, archive and box, look over everything in the storage area, try and get the computers to work, and even check the bedroom and its connecting dining area and restrooms, all to no avail. Your search doesn't bear fruit, and so you're left waiting inside as the storm rages around the building.`
	"CN-10473" `	As Tugroob is more familiar with the vehicles than you are, he checks them before joining you in exploring the tunnels dug into the sides of the mining hole. The holes mostly head in straight lines down, forming straightforward paths to where the lesser ore veins were.`
	"CN-10474" `	The sand continues to pile up into the mine hole when you two come to a vehicle that wasn't driven back fully, and is still blocking the entrance to its tunnel. Tugroob climbs up to see if there's any way to crawl inside, but he is surprised upon checking the driving controls: it's still operational. He drives it back, opening up the hole, and you two go in.`
	"CN-10475" `	Lighting the way ahead with your flashlight, you're surprised to see this tunnel is dug slightly upwards, and brings you not to a large, dug out ore vein spot, but to a rustic mineshaft. A few lights on the walls flicker on as you approach them, lighting up the wooden beams supporting the long hallway. Before you go further inside, you're stopped by Tugroob, who crawls around the floor, walls and ceiling just before the first lamp, looping several times without ever going further in. He only stops to slowly reach one leg inside, then right back out after apparently touching something.`
	"CN-10476" `	"Request support equipment to get through safely, we must," he says, and using a communication device, he calls for assistance from Heliarch agents, warning them about the sandstorm. You head back up to the building to wait for them.`
	"CN-10477" `	Shortly after, several dozen Heliarch agents arrive. Most of them work to keep the sand out, while a few follow you two down and inside the peculiar tunnel, bringing some form of cutting tool and several pieces of sensor equipment. After checking with the sensors for a few minutes, they use the tool to surgically remove what Tugroob was slowly examining before: several extremely thin wires, connected to some type of machinery hidden within the wooden beams.`
	"CN-10478" `	After they're done, the agents storm the place but find nobody. What they do find are dozens upon dozens of crates filled to the brim with Heliarch staves, blaster guns, riot gear, and other weaponry.`
	"CN-10479" `	They escort you and Tugroob back outside as the agents prepare to bring the smuggled weapons to their own ships. Though the storm is still raging on, you can make out the shape of a few Heliarch Interdictors parked near your own ship right before you take off. You regroup with Iplora and Kirrie, and they ask Tugroob for more details on the ordeal before they head to their own bunks.`
	"CN-10480" `	You two exit the building and approach the hole, find one of the many ramps leading down the spiral, and carefully make your way down. You pass by some large mining vehicles, akin to very large trucks with thick tracks instead of wheels, and many bores and drills at the front. Tugroob explains they are used to open up tunnels that extend outwards from the main dig hole, to reach lesser mineral deposits without needing to excavate needlessly.`
	"CN-10481" `	Continuing on your way down, he points to some of the holes made by the machines, and to many more vehicles deep down near the bottom.`
	"CN-10482" `	You two speed up as you continue plunging down the mine, and as you're about a quarter of the way down you can see the bottom clearer. Over the years, it seems the local storms have been filling it up with sand, and with the operation inactive, nobody's bothered clearing it out. The sand's not enough to have reached the larger mining machines, but you suspect even they'll be covered completely in the coming years.`
	"CN-10483" `	Tugroob stops you at one point, taking your attention to the top of the hole. The clear sky has grown much darker, with the storm clouds covering most of it, and you can see the wind's picked up and is launching many smaller rocks down. All the while more and more sand seeps into the hole. "Leave we must, Captain. Search we cannot amidst a sandstorm, and reach in time the bottom we will not."`
	"CN-10484" `	To save time and avoid the long spiraling ramps, you cling to Tugroob as he cuts his way up the hole, climbing its walls while carefully avoiding the rocks and falling sand. You barely reach the building before the storm fully engulfs the mine, and decide to wait there. While you wait, you and Tugroob search around more but ultimately find nothing.`
	"CN-10485" `	Night falls with no sign of the storm dying down, and after receiving a notification from Iplora, Tugroob informs you that you should both head back to the ship and pick her and Kirrie up. As soon as the storm lets up slightly, he helps you out of the building and through the raging winds, until you reach your ship. You two meet up with the rest of the group, and the agents head to their bunks.`
	"CN-10486" `	"I see," he says. He gives you the coordinates he needs to go to and you drop him off before returning to the hangars.`
	"CN-10487" `	Kirrie and Iplora come back hours later and contact Tugroob, who says you can pick him up where you left him. Once he's back in your ship, he tells you he found nothing worthwhile.`
	"CN-10488" `For this planet, the trio informs you that they cannot spend too much time in one place considering how densely populated it is. Instead, they hand you the coordinates of dozens of factories, with instructions to take them to each factory in whichever order you'd prefer.`
	"CN-10489" `	"Surprise inspections, we shall perform," Kirrie says as the three prepare their equipment and weapons. You spend hours flying around the planet dropping one agent off in a factory, flying off to another, then another, then picking up the first of the three in a seemingly endless cycle.`
	"CN-10490" `	After picking up Tugroob from the last factory, they all analyze their findings one last time. They do this by going over each individual factory, mechanically running down a long list of "possible abnormalities" for each, leaving a mark on the side, and briefly writing a description if any such "abnormality" was noted in a factory.`
	"CN-10491" `	"Unauthorized power surges to some replicators, we found. Missing as well, some records of storage transport were," Iplora says. You land on a Heliarch base, and they hand a copy of their findings to the Heliarchs stationed there before returning to your ship. As they head to their bunks, you see several Heliarch ships fly off in the direction of some of the factories.`
	"CN-10492" `Kirrie, already donning his winter coat, instructs you to land near the equator. He says him and Tugroob will conduct some subtle interrogations, stating that it's 'all they can do' in this climate.`
	"CN-10493" `	You drop them off in one of the larger settlements there. After they leave, Iplora asks that you bring her close to the southern pole of the planet.`
	"CN-10494" `	"Suspiciously similar, independent reports on that area have been. Tasked with investigating it, I was."`
	"CN-10495" `	As you land on an isolated icy patch, just out of reach of a growing snowstorm nearby, Iplora finishes her preparations. You find her carrying a bag with some equipment and wearing what is - at least when compared to what her colleagues were wearing - fairly light clothing. Although she is a Saryd, you still worry that she might be frostbitten in this extreme weather, but she reassures you that she will be fine.`
	"CN-10496" `	She tells you she'll be back in a few hours, and waits for you to open the hatch.`
	"CN-10497" `	"Good luck. Be careful not to get lost in all this snow."`
	"CN-10498" `	"Hold up, I'll go with you so we can search faster."`
	"CN-10499" `	She pauses in thought for a few seconds, looking back at you. "Certain of that, are you, Captain? Treacherous, these storms can be."`
	"CN-10500" `	"Don't worry, I can carry my weight through some snow."`
	"CN-10501" `	"On second thought, you're right. Good luck out there."`
	"CN-10502" `	You open the hatch, and she begins her trek. You slouch around your ship for a few hours, waiting for any signal from the Heliarch agents, but nothing comes up on your commlink. Iplora comes back, saying she couldn't find anything, so you leave and pick up Kirrie and Tugroob. They also return empty-handed.`
	"CN-10503" `	She remains silent, moving away from the hatch and taking a seat to wait. You head to your room and prepare yourself for what's to come with the warmest, best clothing you could find for the snowy grounds. When you're done, you head back to your controls to open the hatch, and the both of you head out into the white fields. Not long after leaving your ship, you can make out small, dark lines nearby. It seems you landed close to a forest. Unfortunately, the trees don't do much to protect you from the increasingly dense snowfall.`
	"CN-10504" `	You continue deeper into the lifeless forest for what feels like hours, so long that your feet start feeling slightly numb from the cold. After yet another turn amidst identical trees, Iplora guides you out of the forest to a snowy plain, dotted with a few dozen small, sturdy houses. Iplora explains it was something of a resort, popular with Kimek families when the planet wasn't as cold as nowadays. The storm is not so terrible here, so you can also faintly see cave entrances in a few small mounds at the edges of the resort grounds. Snow-covered boulders litter the entire plain, and Iplora warns you to take care not to trip on them.`
	"CN-10505" `	"Check the caverns, we must. More relentless, the storm will soon become," she says.`
	"CN-10506" `	"Lead the way."`
	"CN-10507" `	"You go ahead. I'll see if I can find anything in the houses."`
	"CN-10508" `	She nods and tells you that the place is shut down, so you can force your way into the houses if needed. As she starts making her way uphill, you head to the closest house and blast the lock after a few failed attempts at opening it normally. You crouch past the entrance of the abandoned home, clearly not intended for any non-Kimek, and begin searching the interior. The furniture is still in surprisingly good shape, if a bit dusty, but you find nothing inside any of the containers, below any of the beds, or hidden under the flooring.`
	"CN-10509" `	You move on to the next house, and speed up the process as you go along and get used to the standard layout of the resort homes. After you're done with the fifth one, you leave to find the snowfall growing stronger. It might be best to try and look for Iplora and see if she's found anything, before the blizzard sets in fully.`
	"CN-10510" `	(Enter the nearest cavern.)`
	"CN-10511" `	(Try and dig through the snowy mounds to find something.)`
	"CN-10512" `	You claw away at the snow and hit a hard surface, but it turns out to be just a rock. You try some other mounds to no avail, and right as you finish digging through another pile of snow only to find another rock, Iplora appears behind you.`
	"CN-10513" `	"Counterproductive, cleaning away the snow is," she says. "Found nothing, I have. Back to your ship, we must go."`
	"CN-10514" `	(Go back to the ship.)`
	"CN-10515" `	(Keep digging.)`
	"CN-10516" `	You rush inside the nearest cave, turning on your flashlight as you carefully explore its interior. After a while, you notice another light coming from further inside the cave, and Iplora emerges soon after. "Found anything?" she asks, and you shake your head. Aside from some small campsites, she didn't either. You wait inside a bit more, and when the weather clears and night approaches, you follow her back to the ship.`
	"CN-10517" `	Once you're there, you leave to pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who also come back empty handed. The agents head to their bunks, and you prepare to take off.`
	"CN-10518" `	Following her up the hills proves difficult at first, what with your legs sinking into the snow, but the ground below becomes more and more solid - if a bit bumpy - the further into the resort you go. You try to watch your step around the boulders scattered about, but after stepping on a patch with deeper snow than usual, you trip over one of the mounds. She helps you up, and the two of you eventually arrive at the entrance of one of the caverns.`
	"CN-10519" `	(Go inside with Iplora.)`
	"CN-10520" `	(Search around the snow field.)`
	"CN-10521" `	You tell her you'll look around the snow for a while and go inside if the storm gets rough again. Walking around in the developing blizzard, this time minding the bumpy ground below, you try to look for anything off about any of the resort homes, or perhaps spot something in the snow itself. Although the scenery is a great sight, the task quickly becomes dull. Even after walking around the entire resort, your efforts produce no results. The snow starts falling much faster, so you begin making your way back to the caverns.`
	"CN-10522" `	With your focus on blocking a gust of snow, you end up tripping over another one of the mounds on your way, and realize you don't remember which cave Iplora entered. Considering the weather, though, taking shelter in any of them would be a good choice.`
	"CN-10523" `	You and Iplora bring out your flashlights as you two explore the caverns. After some twists and turns, she notices some large rocks that evidently broke free from the walls, but still hug them closely. She puts down her flashlight and starts pushing the rocks, revealing a passage to a small campsite containing some makeshift beds, knocked over equipment boxes, and a worn down campfire in the middle.`
	"CN-10524" `	You search through the boxes as she examines the room looking for some other hidden area, but neither of you find anything. She checks the campfire and concludes that nobody has been here for a few months. You continue exploring the cave and eventually loop back outside, leaving via another cave entrance that, according to Iplora, is this time much further from the forest. Given the blizzard is now strong enough that you've lost sight of the forest from earlier, you wonder how she's even managing to tell where you are, and for how much longer she'll be able to do so.`
	"CN-10525" `	(Suggest returning to the ship.)`
	"CN-10526" `	(Continue looking around the caves.)`
	"CN-10527" `	You head back inside and continue exploring the cave system. You two find a few more of the hidden campsites, but all are as abandoned as the first one. You're alerted by the wind, snow, and ice whenever you're close to another exit.`
	"CN-10528" `	After a few hours, the storm finally subsides, and you both return to your ship. You leave to pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who also come back empty-handed.`
	"CN-10529" `	Iplora hesitates for a bit, then explains that you could get sick going through the storm now. She suggests instead that you wait in the caves until it is safe for human passage.`
	"CN-10530" `	You insist, and she reluctantly gives in, telling you to stick close to her. She moves slowly so you have no problem keeping up, but time and again you keep falling over, tripping on the mounds the rocks have created. Another fall, and Iplora reaches her hand out to help you up once again.`
	"CN-10531" `	(Take her hand.)`
	"CN-10532" `	(Try and dig through the snow to find something.)`
	"CN-10533" `	She helps you up, and you continue on your way down the hills. You get back to the forest, and she starts finding the trail back to the ship. Halfway through, the storm gets progressively weaker.`
	"CN-10534" `	When you two return to your ship, you leave to pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who also come back empty handed.`
	"CN-10535" `	You start clawing your way down the snow as Iplora asks you to stop and continue moving toward the ship. You continue, your hands getting colder as the snow steals the heat even through your gloves. You hit a hard surface and start clearing from there, only to see it was, in fact, just a boulder.`
	"CN-10536" `	"Satisfied? Return, we must. Come now," You turn to see her offering her hand once again.`
	"CN-10537" `	(Head to another mound and try digging there.)`
	"CN-10538" `	You stand up and run to another spot where you fell over. Iplora follows you, and even with the snow muffling the sounds around you, you can hear her exasperated sigh. She tries to pull you away, but you hit a hard surface yet again, this time creating a faint metallic echo. She takes her hands off of you and lays down, now helping you dig out whatever is there. Once the object is visible, she stands up. Though much of it is still buried, you can tell it's a very large metal container of sorts - the part that's out of the snow looks almost like the larger end of a coffin.`
	"CN-10539" `	After clearing out what snow you could from over the rest of the object, you see it's many times larger than either of you. You try to look for some way to open it while she starts going over her bag, looking for something, but the cold, frost-plagued metal doesn't budge to your efforts. She finally seems to find what she was looking for - some sort of comms device - but before she has a chance to activate it, an energy blast from the far side of the resort rattles the ground nearby. It misses her by only a meter or so, and melts much of the snow it hit to nothing.`
	"CN-10540" `	She yells for you to get down, pulling out a Heliarch blaster weapon from the bag and firing back in the direction the shot came from.`
	"CN-10541" `	(Take cover.)`
	"CN-10542" `	(Pull out my gun and help her.)`
	"CN-10543" `	You rush to the nearest resort house, staying behind it and hoping you'll have enough protection from the blasts. You can still hear Iplora move around, and you occasionally peek your head over to see her shooting and taking cover behind the houses herself, narrowly avoiding incoming blasts as she tries to close in the distance with whoever or whatever is shooting. The shots stop suddenly and you see her come over, saying that it should be safe to get out now.`
	"CN-10544" `	"Fled, our attacker has," she claims. From the looks of it she wasn't injured. You two get back to the dug out spot, and Iplora grabs her bag. She managed to call for support in between running for cover and shooting back, and you two wait by one of the houses for a few minutes.`
	"CN-10545" `	You two start shooting back as you move for cover behind the resort houses. Iplora signals for you to head out to another house, while she takes a different path. Rushing to the next house for cover while shooting in the direction of your attacker, you narrowly avoid the shots that come your way. You lose sight of Iplora herself, now only making out the bright blasts from her weapon as she moves quickly through the resort.`
	"CN-10546" `	Trying to keep up, you notice the shots grow less frequent as they alternate between you and Iplora. The blizzard is bad enough that you can't even see the attacker despite getting closer and closer, but it seems that goes both ways, as you and Iplora manage to avoid getting hit without too much trouble.`
	"CN-10547" `	You've barely gotten past half of the resort when the shots stop altogether. Iplora still takes aim for a bit, firing some shots as she continues on past some houses, but ultimately lowers her weapon and comes toward you. "Fled, our attacker has," she claims. You two head back to the dug out spot, and Iplora grabs her bag. She managed to call for support in between running for cover and shooting back, so you two wait by one of the houses for a few minutes.`
	"CN-10548" `	Several Heliarch Neutralizers arrive just before the blizzard subsides, and you're directed to one of them to dry your clothes and make sure you're not frostbitten. Nearly all of the Heliarch agents making the rounds over the resort are Saryds, and are quick to locate more of the coffin-like containers buried in the snow. They pull them out with equipment they've brought in the ships and carefully melt down the ice and snow layers covering them, finally managing to force their lids open once they've dried out.`
	"CN-10549" `	Each one houses a Heliarch Finisher Torpedo inside, to the agents' surprise. As they open them up and reveal dozens of the torpedoes, Iplora heads out with a group of agents so that she can show them signs of the shootout with the attacker. She gives her thoughts on where they could be fleeing to, and informs another group on the layout of the local caverns before they head underground. When she's back with you, one of the captains of the Neutralizers tell you that they will handle everything from here, and has one of the ships take you two to where your own ship is parked. He leaves as you prepare to take off.`
	"CN-10550" `	You head back to pick up Kirrie and Tugroob, who are excited to hear about what happened. They themselves didn't find anything, but they're content with listening to Iplora as she tells the story.`
	"CN-10551" `When you land, a couple of other civilian ships land nearby. Some Kimek leave them and wait outside your own. Kirrie is the only one to leave, and after speaking a bit with the other Kimek, they leave for the city, splitting in two groups.`
	"CN-10552" `	"Not fond of outsiders, the people of this world are," Tugroob explains. "Decided to employ undercover Kimek agents, Consul Iekie has."`
	"CN-10553" `	You wait around for a couple hours as Iplora and Tugroob tinker with your ship's communication devices, keeping in contact with the two groups. They don't mention if either group finds anything, and as night falls, Kirrie returns to the ship on his own. He doesn't say anything of the operation, instead just heading to his bunk to rest. Iplora and Tugroob follow suit, after telling you to depart whenever you're ready.`
	"CN-10554" `Three Heliarch agents are waiting for you when you land. "The human visitor who so much to our society has contributed, we greet," the Saryd says as they all salute you.`
	"CN-10555" `	"Sent by Consul Aulori, we were," the Kimek says proudly, as if you were supposed to know who that is. "An important task for you, he has in mind."`
	"CN-10556" `	"How far would the visitor go, if to further help our Coalition, it meant?" the Arach asks.`
	"CN-10557" `	"I'd be glad to help. What do you need?"`
	"CN-10558" `	"I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at."`
	"CN-10559" `	"Obviously, I have my limits."`
	"CN-10560" `	"A jump drive, you possess. Far away, you can travel. Bother you, the harsh cages of the Quarg do not," the Saryd explains as all three walk toward your ship.`
	"CN-10561" `	"Few in number, our own jump drives are, and too risky would it be, for one of our own to venture far out," the Kimek adds.`
	"CN-10562" `	"If to help us gain knowledge of the oppressors, you wish, lend the Coalition your ship's sensors for a short time, would you?" asks the Arach.`
	"CN-10563" `	"Are you asking me to spy on the Quarg?"`
	"CN-10564" `	"Sorry, I don't want to get involved in your conflict with the Quarg."`
	"CN-10565" `	"As espionage, a 'malfunction' qualifies not," the Saryd responds.`
	"CN-10566" `	"Merely alter your own ship's sensors, we would. For a time, specially tuned to scan Quarg worlds, they would be," the Kimek clarifies. "No evidence against you, they would have."`
	"CN-10567" `	"Alright, which worlds do you need me to land on?"`
	"CN-10568" `	They ask you to show them your map of the galaxy, so you bring them inside your ship and point out to them all the Quarg planets and stations you have found. They're a bit startled when they first see the entire map, as if unsure about where to send you.`
	"CN-10569" `	You give them a quick rundown of each Quarg world, and after discussing among themselves for a bit, the Saryd speaks. "Interested in the Quarg's mining operations, and the various construction stages of their ringworlds, the consul is."`
	"CN-10570" `	He points to some of the worlds, and you list the places you need to land: <stopovers>.`
	"CN-10571" `	They call for some engineers to come work on your ship's sensors, the whole thing taking just a few minutes. When they're done, the Heliarch agents thank you for your cooperation, and tell you to head for the <destination> when you've collected all the data.`
	"CN-10572" `The Heliarch trio are eagerly waiting for you when you return. They are quick to welcome you, urging you to show them your ship's logs so they can see what information you've gathered. They don't seem to pay much mind to data on Grakhord or Forpelog, being much more interested in the ringworlds. As they examine the data, though, the Saryd frowns. The Kimek brings all his legs closer to his body, and the Arach squints all her eyes - probably their versions of the Saryd's reaction.`
	"CN-10573" `	"Land on the rings, you really did, right Captain?" the Saryd asks while pointing at the places you visited.`
	"CN-10574" `	You nod, and the Kimek hits your control panel lightly with one of his legs. "No data on the rings, the sensors collected! Gone wrong, something must have."`
	"CN-10575" `	They have engineers return your sensors to normal, while you explain how your ship behaved while landing on them. They speak among themselves for a while, then the Arach says, "Too straightforward an approach, we might have taken. Captain <last>, contact you again soon, we will."`
	"CN-10576" `	They hand you <payment>, and leave to one of the Heliarch sections of the ring.`
	"CN-10577" `Coming in for a landing, something from inside your ship produces an irritating, high pitched whistle sound. It grows stronger the closer you get to the ringworld, until your ship completely shuts down. Your controls are rendered useless as you scramble to land manually, only for your autopilot to click back to normal and land as usual at the last moment. Looking outside, you spot several Quarg standing still, staring at your ship, until they hastily leave without contacting you at all.`
	"CN-10578" `	While you told them this was nothing more than a barren mining outpost, the Heliarchs still insisted on gathering intel on this small moon. Regardless of its usefulness, you land as they asked and let your scanners get a proper reading on this world.`
	"CN-10579" `As instructed, you land on Grakhord and let your ship work normally while the Heliarch sensor gets its reading. Though Heliarch technology is very advanced, you wonder if just by modifying your scanners they could penetrate the layers of rock to fully reveal the Quarg mining operation.`
	"CN-10580" `When you approach the ringworld for landing, a couple of lights start flickering on your control panel, and you can make out some whistling coming from somewhere inside your ship. It continues for a few seconds before stopping.`
	"CN-10581" `You don't really know what the Heliarchs did to your sensors, or if you can even see the data they are collecting, but as you come in for a landing, you hear a faint whistling sound from the hull of your ship. It's short lived, and you land normally. Hopefully nothing broke.`
	"CN-10582" `When you land, you're contacted by the Heliarch agents who had you land on some Quarg worlds and rings to collect data. "Captain <last>, a new task for you, we have," the Kimek says.`
	"CN-10583" `	"What do you need me to do?"`
	"CN-10584" `	"I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to risk my ship any longer to help you spy on the Quarg."`
	"CN-10585" `	"Too large and complex for a quick reading, planets and ringworlds are, so wish to get updated scans on Quarg ships, the consul now does," the Arach says.`
	"CN-10586" `	"Scan them during our war, we of course did, but much more precise now, our technology has become," the Saryd explains. "To use one of our own scanners, we cannot ask of you. Much risk, it would pose, but if to the <planet>, a human outfit scanner you could bring, alter it to suit our purposes, we will."`
	"CN-10587" `	"Alright, I'll go there once I have an outfit scanner ready."`
	"CN-10588" `	"That sounds even more dangerous than what you had me do before. Sorry, but I'm not interested."`
	"CN-10589" `	They thank you for your willingness to help, and tell you they will be waiting on the <destination>.`
	"CN-10590" `The Heliarch agents who spoke to you are ready with a team of engineers once you land. They remove the outfit scanner from your ship and take it to a restricted area. After about an hour, they come back, and while you can't see any visible changes to the outfit, they assure you it is better suited for scanning Quarg ships now.`
	"CN-10591" `	The agents then come into your ship, asking for your map again. "Now, in the earliest stages of construction, this ring you showed us is," the Arach says, pointing to <waypoints>, where Lagrange is. "Interested in the Quarg ships guarding that system, Consul Aulori is. Suffice, one scan per type of ship there should."`
	"CN-10592" `Once again the engineers remove your outfit scanner, take a copy of the scan logs, and hand it to the Heliarch agents, who give you <payment>. "Grateful to you, we are, Captain <last>," the Saryd says. "Remember your assistance, the consul will."`
	"CN-10593" `	When the engineers return, they put your outfit scanner back in place. The Heliarch agents say their goodbyes, reassuring you that the Quarg shouldn't attack you for this. "If interested in doing some investigation of your own, you wish, maybe land on their rings again, you could," the Kimek suggests. "Maybe find out something of interest for us, you will."`
	"CN-10594" `	He wishes you safe travels and leaves with his colleagues.`
	"CN-10595" `As you land on <origin>, a Quarg is patiently waiting right outside your ship, as if expecting you to open the hatch. You think nothing of it at first, but when you try and access the local news feed, you notice your monitors' interfaces aren't showing any of the local services and facilities. A few more minutes go by until you realize your ship hasn't been refueled either. You look out to see some more Quarg standing by the refueling machines of the landing pad you landed on, simply looking at your ship. Seeing that the other Quarg is still waiting by your hatch, you head outside to speak with it.`
	"CN-10596" `	"Hello, <first> <last>," it says.`
	"CN-10597" `	"Hello, can I help you?"`
	"CN-10598" `	"Is there some sort of problem?"`
	"CN-10599" `	It blinks, then slowly looks to a Wardragon parked farther away. "You were seen landing on some of our worlds and rings, bringing about strange scanning mechanisms, and were also found to be scanning some of our ships. Why is that?"`
	"CN-10600" `	"I was just curious about your species."`
	"CN-10601" `	"What are you talking about? I never did any of that."`
	"CN-10602" `	"Scanning? I'm sorry, I think my ship just had some malfunctions. I didn't mean to offend."`
	"CN-10603" `	"The Heliarchs asked me to do it."`
	"CN-10604" `	Around ten seconds pass without it saying anything, simply staring at your eyes and blinking slowly. "I see." Without another word, it walks away, heading toward the Wardragon.`
	"CN-10605" `	"And why did you agree? Do you wish to join their ranks, perhaps?" it asks.`
	"CN-10606" `	"I just wanted to help. It's not like I destroyed your ships or something."`
	"CN-10607" `	"They told me that the Quarg keep others in 'separate boxes,' and that you hinder their development."`
	"CN-10608" `	"Perhaps not, but you agreed to collect information on us and our worlds, which hold countless civilians, and deliver the findings to a group that despises us."`
	"CN-10609" `	"And you believe that? Have we restricted your movement? Chastised you for interacting with the Hai or Korath? Even after you agreed to help those foolish, tyrannical Heliarchs, are you not here, in one of our worlds, peacefully conversing with a Quarg?"`
	"CN-10610" `	It blinks a few more times as a few small stripes on its face rapidly alternate between shades of deep blue and bright red. It then ends with, "It would be most wise to cut off all your ties with these 'Heliarchs,' human." It walks away, headed to the Wardragon it looked at before.`
	"CN-10611" `Upon landing, you're contacted by the Heliarch agents who have had you scan Quarg worlds and ships. "Hello again, Captain <last>!" the Kimek greets you. "Thank you again, we must, for your latest service. Much more detailed than what we had, your scans are."`
	"CN-10612" `	The Saryd interrupts him. "Not... satisfied with them, Consul Aulori was, however. Tasked with acquiring your help again, we were."`
	"CN-10613" `	"An exception, the council has decided to make," the Arach explains. "Granted one of our Scanning Modules, you will be. Just for the mission, it is, so return it once it's over, you must. Install it on your ship, a team on the <planet> will."`
	"CN-10614" `	"A 'proper' close-up scan, with a Heliarch Scanning Module, the consul wants," the Arach explains. "Now that in our ranks, you are, simple enough for you, purchasing one should be. Once ready, you are, head to the <planet> to hear the plan, you must."`
	"CN-10615" `	"Okay, I'll be heading there as soon as possible."`
	"CN-10616" `	"Sorry, but I don't want to risk upsetting the Quarg any more than I already have."`
	"CN-10617" `	"Why didn't you just have me do that last time?"`
	"CN-10618" `	"Restricted technology, it is. For Heliarch use only," the Arach tells you.`
	"CN-10619" `	"Dangerous for you, it also was," the Saryd adds. "Provoked into attacking you, the Quarg might have been, if our technology, on your ship they noticed."`
	"CN-10620" `	"And why would that be any different this time?"`
	"CN-10621" `	"Well, I don't want to risk any of that. Sorry, but I can't help you."`
	"CN-10622" `	"Dangerous for you, it could have been," the Arach explains. "Provoked the Quarg into attacking you, it might have."`
	"CN-10623" `	"Come upon some valuable information, the consuls have," the Saryd responds. "A much safer, easier task it would be. Until at the <planet>, you are, permitted to discuss the details, we are not. Interested in helping us once again, are you, Captain?"`
	"CN-10624" `	"Alright, if you're sure it'll be safe, I'll help you."`
	"CN-10625" `	They are both surprised and distraught by your refusal, clearly not having expected it. They insist a bit further, but eventually give up on trying to convince you to help. Disappointed, they leave for a Heliarch office.`
	"CN-10626" `	They are both surprised and distraught by your refusal, clearly not having expected it. Their expressions then coalesce into cold, fearful gazes. They whisper briefly among themselves, then the Saryd addresses you.`
	"CN-10627" `	"Captain, insist we must. An order from the consul, it is. In our ranks now you are, so do you should as dictates the chain of command."`
	"CN-10628" `	"Lose your rank, you could, if to disobey such an order you were. For the best it is that continue aiding us and the consul, you do," the Kimek continues.`
	"CN-10629" `	"Continue, you will. Inform the consul of that we shall." The Arach says, bringing out a device and seemingly confirming you'll be heading to <destination>. Without giving you much window to protest, the three thank you for your compliance and board a Heliarch ship.`
	"CN-10630" `The Heliarch agents and engineers are waiting for you when you land, immediately getting to work on installing the Scanning Module in your ship.`
	"CN-10631" `	"Remember Captain, only borrowing, you are. Once returned, you have, take our scanner back, we will," the Saryd says.`
	"CN-10632" `	"At most until <date>, keep it, you may. Considered theft, it will be, if any longer you take," the Arach adds.`
	"CN-10633" `	"And will that time be enough?"`
	"CN-10634" `	"What exactly will I do with this scanner?"`
	"CN-10635" `	"Normally, unavailable for us low ranks, this information would be," the Kimek begins. "But, instructed us on it, Consul Aulori has, so that relay the plan to you we could. Learned, the consuls have, that guarding a nearby archaeological site in human space, a lone Quarg Wardragon is. Aware of that, were you?"`
	"CN-10636" `	You confirm it, explaining to them that you were involved in the work around the site on Zug, and were there when the Wardragon came in to protect it.`
	"CN-10637" `	"Then no trouble finding it, you should have," the Arach says. "Far from other Quarg, that ship is, so easier for you to flee, it should be, if attack you it does."`
	"CN-10638" `	"All we need, a quick scan is," the Saryd tells you. "Once scanned it, you have, come back right away, you should."`
	"CN-10639" `	You're warned not to disable or destroy the Wardragon should it attack you, as that would no doubt permanently damage your standing with the Quarg.`
	"CN-10640" `	When the engineers are done, the agents wish you good luck, and you head back inside your ship.`
	"CN-10641" `The Heliarch agents have the engineers remove their scanners from your ship immediately when you land back. They seem pleased with the results, looking at the scan logs for the first time as they hand you <payment>.`
	"CN-10642" `	"Survived, you thankfully have, Captain," the Saryd taps your arm.`
	"CN-10643" `	"Odd, it is, that attack the Captain, the Wardragon did not..." the Arach thinks out loud, looking at the scan data. "A fortunate thing, no doubt, but very odd of them."`
	"CN-10644" `	"Much more detailed, these scans are. Certain, I am, that pleased with the results, Consul Aulori will be," the Kimek tells you. "Assisted us greatly you have, Captain."`
	"CN-10645" `	They pass along a message from the consul, who thanks you for all your efforts, and asks that you seek out his agents on <planet>, should you acquire any significant information on Quarg ships or ringworlds. The Heliarchs say their goodbyes and head on their way.`
	"CN-10646" `The Heliarch agents are waiting for you when you land with a team of engineers. They have them perform some quick tests on your Scanning Module.`
	"CN-10647" `	"Take your time with this task, you of course can, Captain, but told us to ask you to be hasty, Consul Aulori has," the Arach says. "Unsure about how long this window of opportunity will last, all of us are."`
	"CN-10648" `	"What's this 'window of opportunity' about?"`
	"CN-10649" `	"What exactly is the task?"`
	"CN-10650" `	You're warned not to disable or destroy the Wardragon should it attack you, as that would no doubt permanently damage your standing with them.`
	"CN-10651" `The Heliarch agents seem pleased with the results, looking at the scan logs for the first time as they hand you <payment>.`
	"CN-10652" `	They pass along a message from the consul, who thanks you for all your efforts, and asks that you seek out his agents on <planet> should you acquire any significant information on the Quarg ships or ringworlds. The Heliarchs say their goodbyes and head on their way.`
	"CN-10653" `As you land on the <origin>, you remember that the Heliarchs have asked you to share with them any information you get on Quarg ships and ringworlds. Would you like to tell them about the destroyed ring you saw on the other side of the wormhole in Deneb?`
	"CN-10654" `	(No, they don't need to know.)`
	"CN-10655" `	You flag down a group of Heliarch agents who were walking by, and they salute you. "A valuable friend, you've proven to be, Captain," a Saryd of the group says. "Of assistance, how can we be?"`
	"CN-10656" `	"Can you bring me to a higher-up? I have some information on ringworlds."`
	"CN-10657" `	"Is there anyone I can talk to about a broken ringworld?"`
	"CN-10658" `	The group discusses among themselves for a bit before bringing you into a restricted section of the ringworld. The inner halls of the <origin> are unlike those of any other Heliarch facility you've been to, with messy arrays of large canisters, equipment boxes, and some form of isolating texture plastered all over the walls, floor and ceiling. Most notable of all, though, is the sheer number of guards stationed here, which, if the few halls you've passed are anything to go by, might well outnumber the civilians present in the ring. "Wait here, please," the Heliarchs escorting you tell you, opening a door to something akin to a conference room. They offer you a seat on one end of a long table.`
	"CN-10659" `	Some ten minutes pass before anyone comes in, but after that many Heliarch members start filling up the room, taking their own seats at the table. When the door opens for the last of them to come in, the guard announces "Consul Aulori," to which all the Helliarchs stand up and salute, the noise of conversation giving room to hooves hitting the ground. He is an old Saryd, with gray eyes, pale hair, and a short, well-kept beard. He wears a peculiar necklace with four large gemstones hanging from it. He sits opposite to you, the other Heliarchs sitting back down when he does.`
	"CN-10660" `	"Forgive me for the delay you must, colleagues," he says to the other Heliarchs. "Caught up in my evening prayers, I was." He examines the room for a while, briefly glancing at each of the Heliarchs, until his eyes settle on yours. "Told, I was, that some valuable information for us, you have, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-10661" `	"I know of a system where a broken Quarg ringworld is. I figured I should tell you."`
	"CN-10662" `	"Would I be paid if I told you about a place where you can find a broken Quarg ringworld?"`
	"CN-10663" `	He squints his eyes, then speaks, "Repeat that, could you?" You say it again, and he once more looks puzzled. He gestures to a Heliarch beside him, then takes off the translation box from around his neck, swapping it for theirs.`
	"CN-10664" `	He asks again, and you repeat it again. "An... incomplete ringworld, is it?"`
	"CN-10665" `	"No, it is definitely broken. There's tons of debris littering the system, and no sign of life in it."`
	"CN-10666" `	"I didn't say incomplete, I said broken. I know the difference."`
	"CN-10667" `	The other Heliarchs freeze at your tone, and all keep staring at you, as if afraid to look toward Aulori for his reaction.`
	"CN-10668" `	He stares intently at you for a few seconds, then at the agents guarding the entry door. They open it, and call for some more Heliarchs. They come in and position themselves to your sides, and behind you. "Afraid I am that once again, failed to understand it I have, <first> <last>. Now, one final time, repeat it, would you?" Reading the room, you carefully repeat the information, taking care to not come off as impolite again.`
	"CN-10669" `	"Do you now?" He begins. "And hope might I that get to explaining the difference, today still you shall? Require my attention, important work does, so if done being insubordinate, you are, suggest I do that enlighten us all on the difference, you do. Then, decide on whether or not to drop the symbol you seem so eager to disrespect into this system's sun, I will," he says, gesturing to your head and the Heliarch circlet you bear. You carefully repeat the information, taking care to not come off as impolite again.`
	"CN-10670" `	He leans forward lightly, staring at you. Looking around the table, the other Heliarchs are engaged in a what appears to be a quiet, heated discussion, gesticulating and occasionally tilting the table with their body weight amidst whispers.`
	"CN-10671" `	"How?" Aulori asks, eyes still locked on you. You explain as best as you can about where Deneb is, and what you saw on the other side of the wormhole. When you get to explaining how the system was discovered, the Heliarchs seem to collectively gasp when you first utter the word "Pug." You pause, and many go back to the quiet, whispering discussions, some laughing it off, and others staying silent.`
	"CN-10672" `	One Saryd moves as if getting up, but sits back down once Aulori stands, firmly pushing one hand against the table. Conversation around the table dies out, as he stares you down for a long minute. "Leave us for a moment, would you?" he finally says, having some guards bring you outside the room.`
	"CN-10673" `	The whispering discussion from earlier now becomes a much louder debate, though the door muffles it all enough that no translator outside the room manages to pick up what is being said. After half an hour, most voices are cut as someone rapidly hits the table, roughly, yelling something in what you think is the Saryd language.`
	"CN-10674" `	It all grows quiet for a while, and then the door opens again. Some of the other Heliarchs leave in a haste, and you're asked to head inside again. Consul Aulori is standing up still, giving you a nod as you come in.`
	"CN-10675" `	"Adjusted, your ship's sensors will be. Better suited, they will become, for detailed tridimensional projections," he says. He has a pair of Heliarch guards bring you back to your ship, where some engineers go inside your ship and spend some time tinkering with it. After they're done, one of the Heliarchs that was in the room approaches you, telling you they need you to land on the planet you described, <stopovers>, and to travel to <waypoints> to scan the ringworld. He wishes you luck, then hurries back to the restricted areas.`
	"CN-10676" `You're met by a dozen Heliarch guards when you land, and they quickly escort you to the ring's restricted sections after you transmit the scan logs. Aulori, as well as several other Heliarchs from the meeting you had last time, are waiting for you in a large room, where a holographic model of the broken ringworld starts being projected for all to see.`
	"CN-10677" `	"Skeptical of what you told us, we all were, Captain," Aulori says, gesturing for you to accompany him as he walks around the projection. "Claimed that insane, you were, some of those here did." He looks down at a Kimek briefly. "Or that wasting our time with jokes, you were." A Saryd steps back as you two continue, making way for the consul. "Assured me, some of them had, that wholly impossible, it was, to break a ring." He stomps down his hooves close to an Arach and stops where the projection shows signs of greater damage. A large, cut off chunk of the ring is in full display, surrounded by clouds of floating debris. "But not insane, neither a joker, you are. And impossible, this clearly is not. Invaluable information, what you've brought us is, Captain <last>. Investigate the site thoroughly, we must, so ask for your assistance again, we will, when a suitable crew for it, we have found."`
	"CN-10678" `	A Saryd rushes closer once Aulori says that, "Sir, against sending off anyone, the council is-".`
	"CN-10679" `	"Agree, the council will," Aulori cuts him off, still looking at the projection.`
	"CN-10680" `	The Saryd thinks for a while, then continues, "Take years, it would, to find and train someone willing to become an inspector. A dangerous task it-"`
	"CN-10681" `	"And wait around for years, we will not," Aulori interrupts him again. "On borrowed time, we already are. Either find someone willing, and find them fast, you should, or find another line of work, you will," he looks at the Saryd, then at the door.`
	"CN-10682" `	"Dangerous?" Aulori scoffs, interrupting the Heliarch once again. "Plagued by the council's cowardice, your mind is. Make it back, Arbiter Sedlitaris did. Alive and well she is, and helped by this very human in her expedition, she was," he says as he nods your way. "Living proof she is that unfounded, the council's archaic paranoia is. Now, find someone willing quickly, you must, before learn of this and meddle with our work again, they do."`
	"CN-10683" `	The Heliarch leaves the room, and Aulori hands you a chip worth <payment>. He has you escorted out of the room and back to your ship, promising to have more work for you soon.`
	"CN-10684" `A Heliarch delegation contacts you as you land on <origin>. "Greetings, Captain. Sent by Consul Aulori, we were," one of them says. "Requested, your presence is, at the <destination>."`
	"CN-10685" `	They tell you they weren't informed as to what the consul needs of you, but ask that you head to the <planet> when possible.`
	"CN-10686" `When you arrive, you find the landing bays empty of ships save for one Heliarch Punisher close to your own ship. What must be hundreds of armed Heliarchs patrol the area. Consul Aulori meets you as you're coming down the ramp. "Carefully analyzing your findings, we have been, Captain. Much insight, they have brought us," he says. "Only so much can be gained from second hand observation, unfortunately. For that reason, escort one of our own ships there, you must."`
	"CN-10687" `	He points to the Punisher close to your ship, and you see its crew loading dozens of cargo containers into it. He tells you the ship will follow you to the broken ring, and set up a base on Ruin so that they may study the debris closely for a longer period.`
	"CN-10688" `	"Of course. I'll show them the way."`
	"CN-10689" `	"What do you expect to find there? Spare parts?"`
	"CN-10690" `	"Well, I think they're probably good to get there on their own. Sorry, but I'm not interested."`
	"CN-10691" `	He grimaces lightly. "Afraid I am, Captain, that an option, that is not. Very unfamiliar with navigating human space as is, we are, and in a truly exceptional location, this ring is. Remind you, I must, that bring us to our attention in the first place, you did, abandon this work now, you cannot. On behalf of our Coalition, insist I must that aid us in this effort, you do." Pausing for just a second, he continues in a lower tone. "Very... unwelcoming to you, the Coalition would become, if drop this now, you did. A few last scanners, the scientists have requested, so after quick stop at <destination>, to the ringworld, you will bring them."`
	"CN-10692" `	"Asking for your cooperation, I was not. Orders, these are." He looks at you sternly. "Escort the ship there, you will, or find our Coalition much less hospitable to you, you shall. A few last scanners, the scientists have requested, so after a quick stop at <destination>, bring them you will to the broken ring."`
	"CN-10693" `	"Too advanced, the composites that make up this and all other ringworlds are. Replicate them, we cannot. Not yet. If how this one was destroyed, we learn, maybe how to construct parts of our own, we could. If not, then perhaps find we may what means used to damage it were, and so ways of our own to damage the rings, we may find. Managed to do so before, we haven't."`
	"CN-10694" `	"Alright, I'll show them the way."`
	"CN-10695" `	"Well, I'm no megastructure engineer, so I don't see the need to go there myself. They can find their own way."`
	"CN-10696" `	"Excellent. Equipped with a jump drive, the ship is, and to reach this 'Ruin' planet, enough fuel, it has. A few last scanners, the scientists have requested, so after quick stop at <destination>, to the ringworld, you may bring them."`
	"CN-10697" `	He introduces you to the Punisher's crew, and the dozens of scientists and engineers who are preparing to board the warship, ready to accompany you. He wishes you all good luck and leaves, escorted by a few dozen guards. Once the consul is out of sight, some among the Punisher's crew start fidgeting. Their Captain, an Arach, has them ready the ship to follow yours, and they prepare to depart.`
	"CN-10698" `The Punisher's captain has some equipment loaded onto the ship, and the mechanics do one last maintenance check on the ship before it leaves Coalition space. The captain tells you they will follow your lead when you launch. Every other minute, he looks nervously at the sky.`
	"CN-10699" `The Punisher's captain had you follow his ship all over the planet after they refueled in <planet>'s odd facilities. Apparently they want an isolated place to set up their camp here, somewhere they wouldn't be easily spotted.`
	"CN-10700" `	They settle for a cavern on the way up a mountain, overlooking a foggy valley. A river is faintly visible through the dense fog. As they unload the cargo and start setting up, the captain comes to you. He is a young Arach, and his previous demeanor of taking worried glances at the sky has grown even more intense here, as he struggles to so much as look at you as he begins talking. "In the name of the crew, thank you I must for guiding us, Captain <last>." He finally settles on a compromise: one pair of eyes fixated on you, and the rest scouring the skies. "Stocked with enough supplies to last just under a year, the ship is, but if fruitful in our efforts to establish some manner of farm we are, remain for much longer, we will. The consul's orders, those are. When about to head back into the Coalition we are, send a message to you I will, notifying that our work here is finished."`
	"CN-10701" `	"Understood. Until then, good luck on your research here."`
	"CN-10702" `	He goes back to looking to the sky with all eyes. "Forbidden it is, to leave the Coalition. To both civilians and Heliarchs alike. Far too dangerous, the outside has proven, and not deemed worthy to risk our jump drives like this, it has been. Worried I am about the ship's - the crew's - safety."`
	"CN-10703" `	"Why is that forbidden?"`
	"CN-10704" `	"Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be alright. Good luck on your research."`
	"CN-10705" `	"Fared poorly, previous Heliarch expeditions to the outside have, besides the very first." He breaks watch of the sky and focuses entirely on you. "Understand I do the importance of this mission, and that counting on us the consul is. Only... sometimes, wonder I do if worth risking us all, the mission is."`
	"CN-10706" `	"It's still forbidden? But Sedlitaris returned just fine, I flew her through human space and back with no issues."`
	"CN-10707" `	"True that is, but repealed, the measure that prohibits everyone leaving was not. Speak with Arbiter Sedlitaris myself I did, and admit I must that much more at ease now I am. But, still, remain vigilant for the crew's sake, I must. Changed their opinions like me, not many of them have."`
	"CN-10708" `	He thanks you again for your help, and with a salute bids you farewell, heading to help the Punisher's crew establish their base of operations inside the caverns. You get back in your ship and fly back to the empty docks of <planet>. Now it's a matter of waiting for the Heliarch teams here to do their job and return to the Coalition.`
	"CN-10709" `When you've touched down on the landing pads, you see you've received a message from the Heliarchs you brought to Ruin, the mysterious world on the other side of the wormhole the Pug left in Deneb. "Captain <last>, finished what research we could do on the broken ring, we have. About to jump back into the Coalition, we are. Imagine I do that like to speak with you after receiving our report, Consul Aulori will, so head you should to the <planet> as soon as possible."`
	"CN-10710" `To your surprise, your arrival to the <planet> sees no reception party waiting for you, or so much as a payment message from Aulori. You leave your ship, and mention to the nearest Heliarch that you were asked to see Consul Aulori here. They brush you off, saying there has been no such request by the consul. You try and explain that the Heliarch leading the expedition to Ruin mentioned you should come, but they again dismiss you, seemingly unaware of what you're talking about and going on about their business.`
	"CN-10711" `	You try a few more times to no avail, and decide to head back to your ship for the time being. It's not until the day is about to turn that a pair of Heliarch guards come to your ship, asking that you step outside. You comply, and they tell you to follow, "for ready to see you, the consul is."`
	"CN-10712" `	Once again you're led through the inscrutable, guard-crowded halls of the <planet>, being brought to a long corridor with dozens of closed doors. The one at the very end is apparently your goal. From there, however, two more guards arrive, and they explain to those escorting you that "received word, the Ring of Friendship has." They apologize to you, saying Aulori might be busy for some time more. You are brought to just outside the room, so that you're received as soon as his "meeting" ends.`
	"CN-10713" `	From another room, a Heliarch arbiter waves for the guards waiting with you, and passes some other task to them. Three of them leave, and you're left with the one who fetched you from your ship, a Saryd. Despite the door to Aulori's room being locked, you two can still clearly hear intense shouting from within - not just his, but from many others who you assume to be consuls as well. After a particularly long - and heated - debate segment from what seems to be Aulori's voice, the Heliarch guard waiting with you declares they'll be coming back soon and hastily moves away, turning the corner.`
	"CN-10714" `	A few more minutes pass, and you hear some more of the heated discussion from within. After a while, it stops, and the door opens with Aulori on the other side, alone. "Arrived you have, I see, Captain. Forgive me for the wait, you must. Just going over the findings of the expedition, some more consuls and I were."`
	"CN-10715" `	"It's alright, I didn't mind the wait."`
	"CN-10716" `	"I was just about to head back to my ship. It seemed your meeting was never going to end."`
	"CN-10717" `	He beckons you to the middle of the room, still lit up only by the many monitors used for the video calls with other consuls. He moves to a small desk near the wall with the monitors, and picks up <payment> in chips, handing them to you. "Find what they could with what time they had, the expedition did. Only so much time to experiment there was, when a single ship - a warship - the fleet had. Mistake me not, greatly pleased with the preliminary results, I so far have been, but frustrating it is that limited we are by such time and resource constraints." He sighs. "Like I would, for there to be a larger, more substantial expedition to that ring. But stand as it does, seem it does that wait I must for the council's approval, before taking any further action."`
	"CN-10718" `	He moves to pick up a small box on the other side of the room, sitting atop a table surrounded by boards with scribbled notes and mock-up schematics. He brings the box to you and opens it, revealing inside a very small piece of something clearly metallic in nature, but with some odd, unknown property to it you can't identify. "One billion."`
	"CN-10719" `	"Is this that expensive?"`
	"CN-10720" `	"Over the course of the War of Independence, the amount of kilotons of fissile material used in projectiles that bombarded this ring. One billion. For this ring alone. Not a single dent, they left. Not one." He picks up the piece. "One of the smaller shards of the shattered ring that recover, the expedition could." He gazes at it for a few seconds, before putting it back in the box and returning it to the table. "In my position, to learn of the Quarg, learn as a Quarg, I have had to. Think like them, I must, if to attempt to breach the many blockades they have placed to impede others from learning from their technology, I am. Outnumbered by them, we are. Inferior we remain in our technology. If a means to close the gap, I do not find, then perhaps learning what monstrous weapon could break their rings, learning how to create such a weapon, the only hope for deterring a Quarg offensive is."`
	"CN-10721" `	Aulori pauses for nearly a minute, looking at the monitors. "It matters not what nonsense other consuls may tell you, Captain. Know this: give up on their rings the Quarg never will. With your help, and the efforts of the expedition, prepared yet for them, we may become."`
	"CN-10722" `	He thanks you again, and gestures for the door. Many guards arrive soon after you two leave, and you're accompanied back to your ship. As you leave, Aulori heads deeper into the ring's hallways to further study the report about the destroyed ringworld.`
	"CN-10723" `	The discussion inside continues, with no sign of dying down. Judging from the relatively quick journey from your ship to here, you figure you're not very deep into the ring's restricted sections, so your circlet's neural interface might have permission to open the door.`
	"CN-10724" `	(Try to open it.)`
	"CN-10725" `	(Just wait outside.)`
	"CN-10726" `	As you thought, the door responds to your command. The room is dark, with many lab instruments, computers, and countless boards with notes all over them being lit up solely by the various monitors on one end of the room. Aulori is there, alone, speaking with several other consuls via video call.`
	"CN-10727" `	A Kimek consul occupies the most prominent monitor, and seems to be leading the discussion at the moment. "Exempt you are not from our laws and protocol. Your transgression aside, call I must for the others involved to be deposed at once. The Punisher's captain, and crew as well."`
	"CN-10728" `	On the most prominent monitor, you recognize Consul Iekie, the Kimek Heliarch who you aided in investigating various Coalition worlds for suspicious activity. She seems to be leading the discussion at the moment. "Exempt you are not from our laws and protocol. Your transgression aside, call I must for the others involved to be deposed at once. The Punisher's captain, and crew as well."`
	"CN-10729" `	"Come to pass that will not. Given they were those orders by me. Serving the will of a superior, they were," Aulori replies. "Surely encourage the lower ranks to disobey, you would not."`
	"CN-10730" `	"So claim you do full responsibility over this clear transgression?"`
	"CN-10731" `	"Claim I do that acting on my behalf and on my orders, my subordinates were. Committed, no transgressions were. Now, if to talk about taking responsibility for the actions of those working under us, we are-"`
	"CN-10732" `	"Weasel out of the matter at hand you will not," she interrupts him. "Aware you of course were that forbidden, further expeditions to the outside are, and to not have alerted the council of it, broken law twice-fold, you have."`
	"CN-10733" `	The other consuls lash out some more at Aulori after she's done, and he waits for them to finish. "Made chief researcher I was on Quarg artifacts and ringworlds, centuries ago. Continued to study and deepen our knowledge on the subject, I since then have, and acted against the interest of uncovering the secrets of the Quarg, I not once have. Saved us centuries - if not millennia - of research, this expedition has. Now, look deeper into the findings myself, I must. To further our fight, and so that a fighting chance we may have. Believe, I do, that likewise, much more productive activities you all have, where concerned the well-being and stability of our Coalition is?"`
	"CN-10734" `	The others deliberate for a few minutes, before settling on an end to the discussion. "Once done analyzing the findings you are, report them at once you must, before the full council on the Ring of Friendship. Decide then, we shall, whether overlooked, these transgressions will be." Aulori agrees, and the call ends.`
	"CN-10735" `	He turns to leave, and you see the quick surprise on his face as he spots you, clearly too immersed in the discussion before to have noticed you watching. "Well, clear it is that arrived you have. Curious, were we, <last>?"`
	"CN-10736" `	"I was only here for the end."`
	"CN-10737" `	"They didn't seem too happy with you."`
	"CN-10738" `	He grunts. "Cowards, the lot of them. True, it is, that something of a gamble I took, risking one of our jump drives beyond an unknown wormhole. But, necessary it was. Necessary for our understanding. For our survival."`
	"CN-10739" `The spaceport on <origin> is in quite a lot of turmoil, as dozens of Heliarch agents march around at an accelerated pace. Some prepare to board their own ships, and others speak with some of the captains here. It's no different with you, as a Kimek agent approaches you after noticing you watching.`
	"CN-10740" `	"Much assistance, we require, Captain," they say. "A transport for <destination>, we need. For <bunks> of us, and <cargo>. Of great urgency, this task is."`
	"CN-10741" `	Without you even noticing it, an Arach agent has also gotten close, and after the Kimek is done speaking, says, "Attacking several factory districts and government buildings, the terrorists are, so at once we must go. <payment>, you will receive, if by <date> we arrive."`
	"CN-10742" `	"I'd be glad to help. Bring your colleagues and the cargo to my ship."`
	"CN-10743" `	"Terrorists? Can't the Heliarchs on that planet take care of it themselves?"`
	"CN-10744" `	"You'll have to find someone else. I'm not heading there right now."`
	"CN-10745" `	"As I said, hit many government buildings, they have," the Arach explains. "Damaged several garrisons, the attacks did, and crippled the local agents' immediate response capabilities, they have. Not to mention, a very populous and busy world, <planet> is, so a more difficult task, locating and arresting the criminals is."`
	"CN-10746" `	"To keep the peace, our job is," the Kimek adds. "If to assist in achieving that goal, you wish, transport us there, you should."`
	"CN-10747" `	"Okay. Bring your colleagues and the cargo to my ship."`
	"CN-10748" `	They thank you for your cooperation, and use a device to call the rest of the agents to your ship. After securing the last of their cargo in your hold, you show them to their bunks and head to the cockpit.`
	"CN-10749" `	They're clearly disappointed, but thank you for your time anyway, before moving on to the next merchant captain and try to recruit their assistance.`
	"CN-10750" `	They're confused by your refusal. "Willing are you not to help your fellow troops? A danger to the civilians of the area, the criminals are."`
	"CN-10751" `	"A shame that is," the Arach backs away, disapprovingly. "Find others to help, we will."`
	"CN-10752" `	The two leave, moving to nearby merchant captains to try and recruit their assistance.`
	"CN-10753" `Having failed to deliver the Heliarch agents on time, they leave your ship with sour looks on their faces. You're contacted by the Heliarchs who had enlisted your help.`
	"CN-10754" `	"Thanks to your lack of discipline, lost we have a prime opportunity to capture dangerous criminals. Unreliable you have proven, <last>."`
	"CN-10755" `	They sign off. It seems you'll not be getting more offers to help the Heliarchs with this particular type of work again.`
	"CN-10756" `You're stopped by a group of Heliarch agents as you enter the spaceport, most of them Arachi.`
	"CN-10757" `	"Injured, many colleagues of ours have been. On <stopovers>, they are," one of them says. "Dealing with containing criminal operations, they were, and surprised them with an attack amidst civilians, the rogues did. Given the circumstances, dangerous for them, it might be, if treated within hospitals there, they are."`
	"CN-10758" `	"<bunks>, in total, you would transport. To <destination> by <date>, they must be brought," the one Saryd of the group adds.`
	"CN-10759" `	"Don't worry, I'll make sure they get help quickly."`
	"CN-10760" `	"Can't you pick them up in your own ships?"`
	"CN-10761" `	"Tragic, but I'm not interested. Sorry."`
	"CN-10762" `	The Saryd shakes her head. "Fled <stopovers> right after the attack, many of the outlaws have. On high alert, local fleets are, to attempt to intercept their ships. Sent a few available ships as aid, we of course have, but still, use more help, we could."`
	"CN-10763" `	"Enlisting the aid of other captains, we have been," another Arach from the group replies. "Heading there, seven other ships already are. In need of as much help as possible, we are."`
	"CN-10764" `	"I see. Alright, I'll head there to pick them up."`
	"CN-10765" `	"Sorry, but it sounds like you've got a lot of help already, and I'm busy with something else."`
	"CN-10766" `	They thank you, and urge you to move to <stopovers> with haste. Spotting a convoy of Kimek ships landing nearby, the group moves to new potential captains to help with the efforts.`
	"CN-10767" `	The Saryd frowns. "A shame that is, use we could all the help available." The group leaves, moving to ask the next merchant captain for help.`
	"CN-10768" `	The group is clearly appalled. "Willing are you not to help your fellow troops?!" One of the Arachi exclaims.`
	"CN-10769" `	"Disgraceful." The Saryd shakes her head. "If injured were you, would you not from your fellow Heliarchs help expect?"`
	"CN-10770" `	The group stomps away, trying to recruit more civilian captains to help.`
	"CN-10771" `Having failed to pick up and deliver the injured Heliarch agents to the healthcare facilities on time, some have succumbed to their wounds, and those who are still alive leave your ship while angrily throwing insults and complaints your way. You're contacted by the Heliarchs who had enlisted your help.`
	"CN-10772" `	"Unbelievable. Cost us the lives of valuable soldiers, your lack of discipline has. Unreliable and apathetic to the woes of our troops you have proven, <last>."`
	"CN-10773" `You help the medical workers get the agents on transport vehicles, and one of the Arach Heliarchs supervising the operation hands you <payment>.`
	"CN-10774" `	"Avoided, many casualties were, thanks to your assistance in our joint efforts, Captain," she says. "Of this cooperativeness, inform my superiors, I shall."`
	"CN-10775" `	"Thank you, but I didn't really do anything too impressive. It was just a simple transport mission."`
	"CN-10776" `	"There were a lot of injured people there. What happened there with the outlaws, exactly?"`
	"CN-10777" `	"Nonsense. Looking for 'impressive' actions, we are not, when asking for assistance we are. Much more valued, your continuous assistance and cooperation is. The key to our Coalition's success, such assistance is."`
	"CN-10778" `	"A terrorist attack, it was. The valuable resources and equipment stockpiled there, they sought. Thanks to the agents' efforts though, robbed, the warehouses were not," she says, pointing to the injured Heliarchs being moved from your ship and into the land vehicles.`
	"CN-10779" `	She bids you farewell and goes back to making sure the injured agents find their way to hospitals.`
	"CN-10780" `Three Heliarch officers approach you as you're walking around the spaceport. "Greetings, Captain <last>. Interested, would you be, in accompanying us? A proposition, we have," the Saryd says.`
	"CN-10781" `	"What's it about?"`
	"CN-10782" `	"Sure, lead the way."`
	"CN-10783" `	"Sorry, not up for taking a stroll right now."`
	"CN-10784" `	"Inform you of that, we cannot," the Kimek says. "Not until accepted our offer, you have."`
	"CN-10785" `	"Fine. Bring me to somewhere you can tell me."`
	"CN-10786" `	"That seems a bit sketchy, I'll pass."`
	"CN-10787" `Three Heliarch officers approach you as you're walking around the spaceport. They salute you, and the Saryd speaks. "Greetings, Captain <last>. Sent by Consul Plortub, we were."`
	"CN-10788" `	"A mission for you, he has, but to discuss it in private, he wishes." The Kimek explains. "Follow us, would you?"`
	"CN-10789" `	After a few dozen twists and turns through the restricted sections of the ring, they bring you to a room where an Arach is waiting, alongside a few other Heliarchs who are discussing something while pointing at a map of the Coalition projected over the table.`
	"CN-10790" `	"Ready to work with us, are you, Captain?" the Arach asks. "The one who asked for you, I am. Call me Consul Plortub, you may."`
	"CN-10791" `	"<first> <last>. Pleasure to meet you."`
	"CN-10792" `	"What job did you have for me?"`
	"CN-10793" `	"In need of one such as you, we are. Received anonymous reports, we have, from loyal patriots and colleagues alike. On <stopovers>, a Saryd world, brewing, terrible activity may be. Rising in activity there, outlaw groups are, we fear," he says. "Your destination, that is."`
	"CN-10794" `	A couple small boxes are brought inside and set on the table. Upon opening them, Plortub shows you they contain several small drones - drones very similar to those employed by the hull repair modules used in Coalition ships.`
	"CN-10795" `	"A union of technologies, it is. Of the scanning module, the incredible surveillance capabilities are. Of the repair drones, the versatile mobility and durable shells are." He explains to you that you're to head to <planet stopovers> to pick up <cargo> produced on the planet, but as you're coming in for a landing, you are to jettison the crates with the drones so that they may act as spybots. "Be inconspicuous, you must. Appear to be a simple, regular job, this must. Return to <origin>, you must, after completed this task, you have. Readily available then, your payment will be. Suffice, <payment> will, surely."`
	"CN-10796" `	He wishes you good luck, and the trio from earlier escorts you back to your ship.`
	"CN-10797" `Landing back on <planet>, you're met by a squad of armed Heliarchs, who are escorting Consul Plortub. He hands you your payment of <payment> with an approving nod.`
	"CN-10798" `	"Aided us once more, you have, Captain. Look forward to further work with you, I do. Search for one of my subordinates in the local spaceport anytime, you should. Have more work for you soon, I might." He performs a brief salute, and leaves for some other section of the ring.`
	"CN-10799" `You're stopped by one of the many armed Heliarchs in the spaceport, and are asked to follow him into the restricted sections. You comply and are led through the corridors until you're brought before Consul Plortub, in a smaller room than last time. Three Kimek Heliarchs are with him.`
	"CN-10800" `	"Ask for your assistance, once again, I must, Captain <last>," he begins. "Long been a difficult world for the Heliarchy, <destination> has. Admit I must, that known and, to my shame, ignored, lawless behavior there has been. Your continued support, you'll once more provide we hope, Captain."`
	"CN-10801" `	"What do you have in mind?"`
	"CN-10802" `	"I'm not really comfortable in helping with these. Can you let me go?"`
	"CN-10803" `	He perks his head up a bit, then mumbles something in his own language, momentarily turning off the translator. He gives in, and has someone bring you back to your ship in a quick march.`
	"CN-10804" `	He stares at you for a few seconds, almost like a statue. "Afraid I am that orders, these are. Received them directly from the Ring of Friendship, from Consul Iekie, I have. A great asset for this task, you would be, Captain, so insist upon your involvement, I must."`
	"CN-10805" `	He introduces you to the three Kimek, and goes to explain the plan. "Been granted access to our civilian ships, you have. Three new Kimek Spires, you have very recently bought. Carrying many passengers to <destination>, in them you are. A very lucrative job, it is." He pauses for a moment to give the Kimek permission to head out. "Pose as civilians, working in your ships, they will. Armed and ready to investigate <planet> thoroughly, the soldiers in those Spires are. Instructed to follow your ship there, these three were."`
	"CN-10806" `	Plortub wishes you all good luck, and you're escorted back to your ship. You see the three aforementioned Kimek Spires parked near the <ship>, and one of the Kimek Heliarchs hails you, saying they're ready to depart when you are.`
	"CN-10807" `Hundreds of Heliarch agents pour out of the three Kimek transports, rushing in groups to separate parts of the city. They march in unison, weapons in hand. From the reactions of the locals, it's clear they were neither expecting such a thing, nor are they happy with the agents going about the city in that manner.`
	"CN-10808" `	When the last of the Heliarchs leave the transports, one of the Kimek captains inform you that you should now head to <destination> to meet with Consul Plortub collect your payment of <payment>, and to "avoid getting caught in any potential retaliation."`
	"CN-10809" `You land in the station to find that <payment> have been transferred to you. Along with the credits comes a transmission from Plortub. "For my absence, forgive me you must, Captain. Hit Fourth Shadow again, criminals have, so organizing some ships from within the Ring of Power, I am."`
	"CN-10810" `	He goes on to explain that the attack was quite a large one, and much of the fleet stationed here was sent to help contain it. The remaining ships are helping with the <origin> operation, so the station is fairly devoid of a military presence at the moment. "A troubled week, this will be, but bother you with that, I will not. Been very useful to us your support has, Captain."`
	"CN-10811" `After the transmission with Plortub ends, the station is awfully quiet for a few hours. You head outside your ship to see if you can find something interesting to do, but you don't find anything particularly eye-catching, as the station holds few shops. You move to the job board, but find it completely empty. You also notice that the market's trade values are not updating, and any news system is non-functional.`
	"CN-10812" `	Suddenly, some of the few Heliarchs still stationed here rush past you heading for an office. They quickly reemerge and approach you.`
	"CN-10813" `	"Captain! Helped us, you have, yes? Aiding in the Remote Blue operation?" You nod. "Think you trustworthy, the consul does, and in dire need of a combat-ready ship, we are. Aid us, you must!"`
	"CN-10814" `	"What do you mean combat-ready? Are we being attacked?"`
	"CN-10815" `	They explain that it's not simply the station's mercantile and news systems that haven't been functioning properly - they haven't been able to contact the group on Remote Blue, nor the fleet that left for Fourth Shadow, nor get in any sort of contact with anywhere else in the Coalition.`
	"CN-10816" `	"Get readings of the local systems only, we can, and alerted us, they have, of incoming ships! Armed, civilian ships! Criminals, no doubt, and fleeing Remote Blue, they are!"`
	"CN-10817" `	You can't say much before they've practically pushed you back into your ship. They promise you'll be greatly compensated for this, and ask that you only disable the ships so you can board and check for hostages, or possibly allow for capture and questioning of the outlaws.`
	"CN-10818" `As you suspected from when you were fighting it, this ship is equipped with Heliarch weaponry. Unfortunately you can neither verify the equipment it is using nor check for hostages, as a self destruction sequence starts when you're about to enter it.`
	"CN-10819" `This ship is equipped with Plasma Turrets from human space, the very weapons the Free Worlds developed. Unfortunately, it initiates a self destruction sequence as you're about to board it, so you cannot verify if it had any hostages.`
	"CN-10820" `This ship is equipped with Torpedo Launchers. Somehow, the criminals have acquired human outfits. You're about to enter the ship and look for any hostages that might have been there, but you rush back when you notice its self destruction sequence start.`
	"CN-10821" `Though you never managed to find out if there were any hostages on board, the Heliarchs stationed at <planet> still herald you as a hero for "detaining the bandits." They immediately set to repair your ship. You're still on alert for a few hours in case any more ships come through, but nothing appears to be out of the ordinary. Near the end of the day, the station returns to normal as well; communications and other functions are restored.`
	"CN-10822" `	As soon as the commlinks are back, the Heliarchs contact Consul Plortub and inform him of what happened. Shortly after, <payment> are added to your account, and you're put on a call with the consul.`
	"CN-10823" `	"Humiliating, it would be, had under such circumstances, the criminal ships escaped. Done well, you have, Captain." He discusses with you the outfits that the ships were using, and is alarmed to learn that they not only had Heliarch equipment, but had acquired human weapons as well. He lets out something you can't quite get, resembling a gasp or a roar; you only know that your ears don't want to hear it again.`
	"CN-10824" `	"Bring this report to the other consuls, at once I will. Ask further tasks of you, we may, but for now, done your work is, Captain." He ends the transmission after a short salute. Heliarch ships rush back in as the local garrison returns from Remote Blue. Many of the ship captains come to personally congratulate you for stopping the fleeing ships.`
	"CN-10825" `A pair of Heliarch Judicators land by your ship as you leave for the spaceport. The workers storm to the ships, getting ready to refuel them. Coming down from one of the Judicators, a young Saryd with black hair barely reaching her shoulders pulls out a watch of sorts, seeming to time how long they take to completely fill up the ships' fuel tanks.`
	"CN-10826" `	When they're done, she gives an approving nod and takes a look around the hangars. When she notices you watching, she approaches you. "Greetings, human visitor," she says. "Magister Lotuora, I am. Intrigued by our ships, were you?" You begin a nod, and that's enough for her to keep talking. "A refueling drill, it was. When coming down, inform the local authorities at the last minute, we do, so that more 'authentic' it is. An important part it is, of testing how well prepared for emergencies we are."`
	"CN-10827" `	"What sort of emergencies?"`
	"CN-10828" `	"And you want me to help with some of these drills, I take it?"`
	"CN-10829" `	"It's good that you do that. I should get going now, though."`
	"CN-10830" `	"All sorts of emergencies," she responds. "Quarg invasions, criminal attacks, response action to natural disasters. Ready for all of them, we need to be."`
	"CN-10831" `	She takes a look at your ship, then to the two Judicators. "About done with the refueling drills, we were. Heading back to <planet>, I was. Set up some more interesting drills, I could, if your assistance, I had. Accompany us back there, would you?"`
	"CN-10832" `	"Alright, what do you need me to do?"`
	"CN-10833" `	"What would these 'more interesting drills' involve?"`
	"CN-10834" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested in that kind of work."`
	"CN-10835" `	"Thought of that, I still haven't," she says. "Some ship combat training, potentially. Very beneficial, training with an outsider could be."`
	"CN-10836" `	"Alright, so should I just follow your ships now?"`
	"CN-10837" `	"Sorry, but I'm not interested in that kind of work."`
	"CN-10838" `	"Follow you to <planet>, my ships will," she says, pointing at the Judicators. "In a rush to head back, we are not, so if immediate business elsewhere, you have, follow you for a while, we could. An extension to the refueling drills, it would be."`
	"CN-10839" `	She tells you she'll pay you <payment> when you reach <planet>, and will prepare another "drill" for you to help with too. She heads back inside one of the Judicators, and they prepare to follow your ship when you launch.`
	"CN-10840" `Lotuora pays you <payment> when you land. "An idea for the next drill, I've had," she says. "Need to arrange some more ships, I do, so need some hours, I will. Meet me in the spaceport when I'm done, you should."`
	"CN-10841" `When you find Magister Lotuora in the spaceport, she shows you to a map of the Coalition. Pointing to two systems, she indicates one in Kimek and one in Saryd space. "Made many calls, I have, and to assemble many ships for this drill, I've managed. How fit for their job, our Hunters are, we shall see."`
	"CN-10842" `	"Will I be fighting them?"`
	"CN-10843" `	"No, no fighting," she says. "Not yet. Only simulating a pursuit, they will be."`
	"CN-10844" `	She points to the systems again. "To land on <planet> and Ashy Reach unseen by the Hunters, your task is. Attack you, they will not, but allow them to be in the system when you land, you cannot. Once cleared both planets, you have, return here for <payment>, you may."`
	"CN-10845" `	"Okay, I'll head out to the planets then."`
	"CN-10846" `	"Can you tell me where my pursuers will be?"`
	"CN-10847" `	"Know of their pursuers, the pursued do not," she says, letting out a laugh as if it was a joke. "Well, usually... From many systems across the Coalition, the Hunters are. Ready to follow your ship when you launch, they will be."`
	"CN-10848" `	She points again to one of the planets. "Still preparing, some Hunters around Ashy Reach are, so head for <planet> first, you should." She wishes you luck on avoiding the Hunters and heads off to a Heliarch military building.`
	"CN-10849" `You land without any of the Hunters tailing you, and a Heliarch on the ground speaks into a communicator while looking at your ship. Minutes later, Magister Lotuora contacts you. "Well done, Captain! Onto the next target, <planet>, you may move." She wishes you good luck again and signs off.`
	"CN-10850" `Once again, you managed to avoid the Hunters while landing on <origin>, and a local Heliarch agent informs Magister Lotuora of your success. "Excellent work, Captain <last>," she says when she contacts you. "Now, talked with some contacts I have, and one more drill for you to help with, I have arranged. Return to <planet> at your earliest convenience, you may." She signs off... and calls back seconds after. "Ah, forgive me you must, Captain. Forgotten something, I had. Hear of the recent drills, some colleagues did, and readied their own Hunters to participate, they now have. Avoid them on your return to <planet>, as per usual, you should."`
	"CN-10851" `	She mentions they've contributed some credits to your reward, now a total of <payment>, which will be yours when you land on <destination> without any of the Hunters on your tail.`
	"CN-10852" `Magister Lotuora meets you when you land, handing you your payment of <payment>, and congratulating you for managing to evade the pursuing ships. "Frustrated many of the Hunter pilots, I heard you have," she says with a laugh. "Good training for them, I hope this was. Finishing up the arrangements for one more drill, I am. When ready, you are, meet me in the spaceport, you must."`
	"CN-10853" `Lotuora is speaking with a Kimek Heliarch captain at the entrance to the spaceport. "Ah, there the Captain is," she tells the Kimek. "Captain <last>, your sparring partner, this is," she says, gesturing to the Kimek, who salutes you with a short bow of her head. "Excited to test her ship against an outsider, she is."`
	"CN-10854" `	The Kimek doesn't stay for long, only wishing you a "good fight" and heading to the hangars, where she boards a Punisher and flies away. You look to Lotuora, waiting for her to explain. "Tough ships, our Punishers are, but looked into your encounter records, we have, and experience in fighting, you have," she says. "To avoid any accidents, we want, so swapped out, the ship's Finisher Pods were. A mere drill, this is, so only aim to disable one another, you shall. If successful, you are, set aside <payment> for your efforts, we have."`
	"CN-10855" `	"Great. I'm excited to test my skills against one of your warships."`
	"CN-10856" `	"Actually, I'm not sure I'm up for this. I don't think my ship can make it against a Punisher."`
	"CN-10857" `	For the first time you see Lotuora drop her smile, seemingly confused and saddened by the prospect of having to call off the match. "What? Come now, Captain, sure I am that do fine you will. If well equipped, your ship is not, free to arm yourself however you wish and return to duel the Punisher at a later time, you are." She takes on a softer tone, and continues. "If really not agreeable to you, this is, cancel the duel I can, but get an opportunity like this, we often do not. Really appreciated, your cooperation with this last drill would be."`
	"CN-10858" `	"Well, alright, I suppose I can look for ways to prepare myself for the fight."`
	"CN-10859" `	"I'm sorry, but I'm just not comfortable taking on a warship of yours like that."`
	"CN-10860" `	She nearly jumps, and her jolly demeanor returns as if flipped by a switch. "Thank you Captain <last>! Truly an unique experience, this shall be."`
	"CN-10861" `	She stares on for a while, then brings up a map. "Headed to the <waypoints> system, the Punisher is. Wait for you there, it will." She tells you to head to <waypoints> when you're ready to fight the Punisher, and reminds you to only disable the ship, as any harsher action would make you a criminal to the Heliarchs.`
	"CN-10862" `Magister Lotuora greets you when you return. "Prevailed over one of our Punishers, you have! Perhaps the real threat, you are, not the Quarg," she says, looking at you for a few seconds as if expecting you to laugh. She hands you <payment>, and continues, "Sent a recording of the fight, I was. Learn much from it, I hope we can."`
	"CN-10863" `	She thanks you for helping her with the drills, saying it will be a great help in training the cadets at the local academy. She concludes by wishing you safe travels, and then heads to a Heliarch building.`
	"CN-10864" `When you land on <origin>, you find a Heliarch delegation waiting for you outside. When you meet them, the Saryd of the group says, "A great ally to our Coalition, you have proven to be."`
	"CN-10865" `	"Discussed your exploits, the consuls have. Much satisfaction, your contributions brought us," the Kimek continues.`
	"CN-10866" `	"With you, a meeting they request. To <destination> you must go, if to join our ranks, you so wish," the Arach finishes.`
	"CN-10867" `The Heliarch authorities of the <origin> have offered you a position in the ranks of the Heliarchs. Would you like to meet with them and officially join the Heliarchy? Given their history with the Quarg, and the rumors of rebellion stirring in Coalition space, this would no doubt set you on a path to conflict with the Quarg and the resistance forces.`
	"CN-10868" `	(No. I don't want to support the Heliarchs at all.)`
	"CN-10869" `	When you land, you're met with a bit of ceremony. A trio of Heliarch consuls welcomes you, each carrying a gemstone: an emerald for the Saryd, a ruby for the Kimek, and a sapphire for the Arach. They each pass the precious stones to you, starting with the Saryd, then the Kimek, and lastly the Arach. Cameras and photographers surround the scene, kept at bay by lines of Heliarch guards. It seems your joining the ranks has turned into something of an event.`
	"CN-10870" `	When the consuls are done, they have you follow them into the restricted sections of the ring, bringing you to a very large, circular room, somewhat like a colosseum or an auditorium, with hundreds of Heliarch consuls seated. There are also many more camera workers and photographers, though all of them are Heliarch members this time. You're instructed to head to the center.`
	"CN-10871" `	The consuls who brought you here speak, and once again you're reminded of your "contributions and loyalty" to the Coalition. "Truly special, this ceremony is," the Arach says. "Join our ranks, for the first time, an outsider does. Contributed much and shown devotion to our Coalition, this outsider has."`
	"CN-10872" `	"From humanity, <first> <last> has come," the Kimek continues. "Our most recent neighbor, and a group still under the chiding eyes of the Quarg, they are. To reach them all, to free them all, we still cannot, but, our first step in that front, Captain <last>'s coronation is."`
	"CN-10873" `	The Saryd approaches you, carrying some type of chest. Opening it, she reveals a golden circlet inside, staying silent and looking at you.`
	"CN-10874" `	"Do I put it on myself?"`
	"CN-10875" `	(Take the circlet.)`
	"CN-10876" `	"Allow others to crown us, we do not," she says. "Not anymore."`
	"CN-10877" `	You pick up the circlet and raise it to your head, the Heliarch consuls all standing up when you do. You bring it down and adjust it so that it fits you well. Once the "crowning" is done, many of the consuls cheer in celebration, which is followed with something akin to a round of applause and more of the speeches from before.`
	"CN-10878" `	When it's all over, you're escorted out by some of the guards, but remain in the restricted sections. Here you are now brought to a much smaller room, where a pair of Heliarchs in lab coats are working at some device reminiscent of a hospital's ultrasound machine. One of them asks you for your circlet, attaching it to various cables near the machine's controls. "Configure your circlet we now shall, so that to your will it responds," the other says, gesturing for you to take a seat. He holds a large, helmet-like piece, with a cable at the top connecting to the machine.`
	"CN-10879" `	"To my will? What do you mean?"`
	"CN-10880" `	"Mere jewelry pieces or symbols of rank, these are not," the one tinkering with your circlet explains. "Serve they do as links, interfaces between a Heliarch's will and our Coalition's machines and programs. Allow you they will to access some of our restricted ring sections, and serve as keys to our many outfitters, they do."`
	"CN-10881" `	They gesture for you to sit and you comply, having the helmet placed over your head. It blocks out your sight completely, and it feels a lot heavier that you had imagined. "Begin now, we shall," you barely hear one of the Heliarchs say, as most of the sound is muffled. Once the process starts, you hear some wave-like humming echo inside your head, and it doesn't take long before you feel as if you're being spun around. Before you get too uncomfortable, the Heliarchs stop the machine and take the helmet off of you. "All done, we are. Here," one says, handing you your circlet back.`
	"CN-10882" `	Putting it on again, you don't notice any difference, but they push you to try it out on one of the doors. You get up from your seat, moving to the entrance door, and it opens up when you're a few steps away. You think to close it, and it does. You repeat a few more times, and turn back to the Heliarchs, who seem amused by seeing you play with your new ability. You look now to the helmet, and with a thought it turns around, seemingly spinning around a head it assumes it is attached to. You turn it off, and begin to test the circlet with the lights and computers in the room.`
	"CN-10883" `	When you're done, the two Heliarchs explain some more. "As of a lower rank you are, permit you access to everything and everywhere, your circlet will not. Not yet, at least. But, as mentioned, come to some of the restricted sections, you now many. On many of our worlds, find you will Heliarch outfitters, where now available some of our equipment will be. Permit you to take on some jobs we put up for Heliarch agents here in the restricted sections, the circlet also will."`
	"CN-10884" `	They commend you for having joined up, and bid you farewell, having the guards now bring you back to your ship. The three Heliarch consuls who greeted you are waiting for you when you arrive, and hand you a small box which you soon realize is a translation device. "One of us you now are, Captain," the Saryd says. "Trust you we do to uphold the Coalition's values and laws."`
	"CN-10885" `	The trio congratulates you once again and wishes you safe travels.`
	"CN-10886" `A Kimek in a blue uniform approaches you. "Good day, Captain. Interested in helping with some charity work, would you be?" she asks.`
	"CN-10887" `	"What sort of charity work?"`
	"CN-10888" `	"Very prosperous, many Kimek worlds have become, but still lagging behind, a few of our planets are," she explains. "Very poor, the people of <planet> are, and many amenities such as computers and communicators, they lack. To help them, our more fortunate want, and offered up many supplies, they have. In need of captains to transport them to <planet>, we are. Offer <payment> for your assistance, we can," she finishes, looking at your ship.`
	"CN-10889" `	"I'd be glad to help you. Have the supplies loaded into my ship."`
	"CN-10890" `	"That's a noble cause, but I don't work as a cargo hauler, sorry."`
	"CN-10891" `	Her mouth produces something of a chirping, clicking sound. "Grateful I am, Captain. Be able to pay you as well as some other jobs, we may not, but know that helping many, you will be. Of that, assure you I do."`
	"CN-10892" `	She signals to some workers with similar uniforms, and in a few minutes they bring the cargo crates to your ship. She explains that more of her colleagues are already on <planet> working with more captains and suggests you look for them when you arrive. She thanks you again, and wishes you a good trip to <planet>.`
	"CN-10893" `A Kimek in a blue uniform approaches you, and you recognize her as Chiree, the Lunarium leader you met when joining them. She asks to speak in private, and you two go inside your ship. "Much better," she says once the hatch is closed. "Easier to explain to you the job, it will be, if speak freely and truly of it, I can.`
	"CN-10894" `	"A 'charity' of sorts in Kimek space, me and other members maintain. True and honest, the donations we receive are, and glad to help those in need within our region, we are. But, also a great cover for certain Lunarium cargo transfers, it is. Wish to enlist your help in that, we do."`
	"CN-10895" `	"What will I be transporting?"`
	"CN-10896" `	"Sorry, I'm not available for that now."`
	"CN-10897" `	"A regular delivery, this one is. Some tech and amenity goods, to <planet>, a poorer world, you would transport. Wish to risk your valuable aid with a dangerous smuggling task right away, we do not, so help you build a background with the charity, we will. Paid only <payment> for this, you would be, but promise you much greater bounties further down the line, I do."`
	"CN-10898" `	"Alright, I'll do what I can."`
	"CN-10899" `	"I actually have some more pressing missions I need to get to, sorry."`
	"CN-10900" `	Her mouth produces something of a chirping, clicking sound. "Good. Very good. Have the goods brought in shortly, I will." She leaves your ship, signals to some workers with similar uniforms, and in a few minutes they bring the cargo crates to your ship. She explains that more of her colleagues are already on <planet> working with more captains and suggests you look for them when you arrive. She thanks you again, and wishes you a good trip to <planet>.`
	"CN-10901" `You find the local charity workers, and they begin unloading the supplies from your ship. When they're about done, you receive a transmission from the Kimek who gave you the job.`
	"CN-10902" `	"Grateful for your services I am, Captain. As simple to you as the job may seem, a great help for those in need, these deliveries are. Contact you again, we shall, if interested in helping more, you are," she says. Once the workers are done, they hand you <payment> and move the crates to a building where Kimek are lining up to receive the supplies. Other workers continue to unload more cargo from arriving ships.`
	"CN-10903" `You find the local charity workers, and they begin unloading the supplies from your ship. When they're about done, you receive a transmission from Chiree.`
	"CN-10904" `	"A simple job it was, Captain, but important nonetheless. More work for you, we'll have, so ask that you keep watch for more members in Kimek space, I do." Once the workers are done, they hand you <payment>, and move the crates to a building where Kimek are lining up to receive the supplies. Other workers continue to unload more cargo from arriving ships.`
	"CN-10905" `As you make your way through the spaceport on <origin>, a Kimek in a blue uniform sees you and approaches. You recognize her as the charity worker who had you deliver some supplies to the poor Kimek world of Fourth Shadow.`
	"CN-10906" `	"Again we meet, Captain <last>! In some more charity work, are you interested?"`
	"CN-10907" `	"I'd love to. What do you need me to do?"`
	"CN-10908" `	"Sorry, charity doesn't pay much and I'm kind of in need of cash."`
	"CN-10909" `	"An ever-colder world, <planet> is. Left the planet, many have, but wish to abandon their homes, lots of Kimek there do not," she explains. "Lacking proper winter clothing for the harsher weather, many are, and led to many job losses, the snowfall has, so delivering various coats and warm clothing pieces, we are."`
	"CN-10910" `	She slowly raises up one leg, struggles for footing with her other five, and waves to a group of other Kimek with the same blue uniform. They come to you and she continues. "Unsuited for such cold climates, we Kimek are, so fall to illnesses, many on <planet> also do. Agreed to help them, these fine doctors have," she says, pointing to the <bunks> Kimek doctors, who all greet you briefly with nods and some leg movement. "Received more incentive funds, we have, so as thanks for your continued assistance, paid more than last time you will be. Help compensate you enough for how much this helps, <payment> hopefully will."`
	"CN-10911" `	Some workers bring <cargo> into your ship, while you show the <bunks> Kimek doctors their bunks. The Kimek who met you here wishes you all a safe trip to <planet>, and moves on to speak with some other captains.`
	"CN-10912" `As you make your way through the spaceport on <origin>, a Kimek in a blue uniform sees you and approaches. You quickly recognize Chiree, and gesture for her to follow you into your ship. "Thank you, Captain," she says once you're both inside. "Another 'charity' job for you, I have. With some passengers, this time."`
	"CN-10913" `	"Just a normal delivery again?"`
	"CN-10914" `	"I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in helping with this kind of work anymore."`
	"CN-10915" `	"No," she is quick to respond. "Well, not entirely. In need of more winter clothing, citizens on <planet> are. Also in need of doctors to combat many illnesses the cold there brings, they are. Transport <bunks> passengers there, you also would. Doctors, two of them are. Headed there to help treat the sick in a hospital. As for the other three... 'researchers' of ours, the best way to describe them is. Of course, if questioned, say that all <bunks> of them are doctors, you must."`
	"CN-10916" `	"Alright, I'll take them there."`
	"CN-10917" `	She leaves your ship, and meets with a nearby group of <bunks> other Kimek - your passengers, you imagine - before having some workers load up the cargo into your ship. The Kimek greet you briefly with nods and some leg movement as you meet them, and after the cargo is ready, you show them to their bunks.`
	"CN-10918" `	"Paid <payment> for this job, you will be. Have a safe trip, Captain," Chiree says before leaving.`
	"CN-10919" `More blue-uniformed workers are waiting when you land, though these uniforms consist of incredibly thick, bulky coats. They take the crates out of your ship while the doctors are directed to a hospital building, and <payment> are transferred to you when the workers are done. They thank you for your help and ask that you look for them in Kimek worlds if you wish to continue helping.`
	"CN-10920" `More blue-uniformed workers are waiting when you land, though these uniforms consist of incredibly thick, bulky coats. They take the crates out of your ship while the "doctors" are directed to a hospital building, and <payment> are transferred to you when the workers are done. They thank you for your help, and come in close as they're about to leave, quietly asking that you look for more members on worlds in northern Kimek space.`
	"CN-10921" `A group of Kimek approach you in the spaceport. They are all in the blue uniforms of the charity you have been helping by transporting supplies and people. "Greetings, Captain <last>," one of them says. "Helped our charity before, you have. Interested in more work, are you?"`
	"CN-10922" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested in helping anymore."`
	"CN-10923" `	"Lack many of their preferred diet options, the Arachi and Saryds on <planet> do," they explain. "Enough to order it from off-world, the poorer of them do not have, so sending them a care package, our group is."`
	"CN-10924" `	They show you to a pile of containers and crates near the hangars, and you have them loaded into your ship. "Once on <planet>, you are, pay you <payment>, we will. Thankful of your help, we are, Captain." They wish you a safe trip, and vanish into the spaceport halls.`
	"CN-10925" `A group of Kimek approach you in the spaceport. They are all in the blue uniforms of Chiree's "charity" group, and one of them signals to your ship once they're close. You get the hint, and bring them aboard. "More work for you, Chiree has. To <planet>," one of them begins the moment you close the hatch. "Prepared an important job, she has. One only you can do. Paid <payment> to deliver <cargo> to <planet>, you will be, and once there, tell you the details about the main mission, she can."`
	"CN-10926" `	"Understood. I'll go there right away."`
	"CN-10927" `	"I'm sorry, but I don't think this line of work is for me."`
	"CN-10928" `	They nod, and you all leave your ship. They show you a pile of containers and crates near the hangars, and load them in your cargo hold.`
	"CN-10929" `You drop off the crates full of charity goods, and the spaceport workers start getting them up on vehicles to transport them to the poor. One of the workers transfers 261,000 credits to your account, thanking you for the help.`
	"CN-10930" `	As they move the last few crates, you hear a rapid tapping approaching from behind, and as you turn to investigate a Kimek tackles you. Some more join in, covering your head with some dark sack, and start shoving you around once they restrain you. You call out for help, but nobody comes. The Kimek keep pushing and tugging at you as they bring you around the city. After many minutes, you hear some doors close behind you, and your captors force you into some cramped room or compartment. You try to stand up straight, but hit your head against the ceiling. It soon becomes clear you're in a descending elevator, and when it stops, you're walked around for a while longer. Finally, the Kimek seat you and remove the sack from your head.`
	"CN-10931" `	The insides remind you of an office building or call center; several Kimek are working in cubicles, most examining computer screens while others speak into communicators. You look back to where you reckon you came from, seeing the entrance to a short elevator by the end of a hallway. Coming around the corner, a Kimek you recognize approaches to sit opposite to you - the Kimek who first contacted you about the charity missions. A group of the blue uniformed Kimek follow after her as they bring a crate: one of the crates you transported here. "Forgive us for the discomfort you must, Captain," she says, as the workers open up the crate, revealing several Heliarch guns stuffed inside. "Wished to speak away from prying eyes, I did. Rest easy, you may, harm you, we will not."`
	"CN-10932" `	"So that's the 'charity work' I've been doing? Smuggling weapons?"`
	"CN-10933" `	"The first time? No, in need of help, Fourth Shadow really is, and do proper charity work, we must, if to keep that disguise, we wish," she explains. "The second time, truly carrying winter clothing, you were, only... doctors, three of the Kimek you transported were not. This time, helped supply our cause, you have."`
	"CN-10934" `	She signals for the Kimek in blue uniforms, and they come to her sides, carefully managing the base of some of her legs. You hear a click, followed by a snap. They pull the prosthetics away from her body, removing the "leg" closest to her head on her left side, and the one furthest from her head on her right side. The Kimek on her left side works on her middle leg, revealing that as a prosthetic as well. "Factory accident," she says, gesturing her head to her right side. "Heroic Heliarch patrols, blasting at the teen Kimek," she gestures to her left side. "Guns of my own, I wanted, to ensure no more legs to them, I lost. Some... rarer equipment, my group needs, though. Help us get that equipment, only you can."`
	"CN-10935" `	"Your group?"`
	"CN-10936" `	"What sort of equipment?"`
	"CN-10937" `	"And if I refuse?"`
	"CN-10938" `	"Then put that sack on your head again, we will, and brought back to your ship, you will be," she says. "Harming you, we are not. Tell on us, you could, but not very... willing to investigate here, most Heliarchs are."`
	"CN-10939" `	"Heard of us in the news, you must have? Terrorists, bandits, outlaws, criminals... many nicknames, the Heliarchs give us." She looks at the weapons inside the crate. "The Lunarium Redoubt, this is. A group of thugs, or whatever they call us, we are not. Trying to rescue our Coalition from the Heliarchs, we are."`
	"CN-10940" `	A pair of Kimek walk past the table where you're seated, headed for the elevator. The Kimek seated in front of you stays silent as she watches them leave. "No criminal, I was, when these two, I lost," she gestures to the stubs on her left side. "Make sure the Heliarchs can never do that again, we will. Greatly appreciated, your help would be." She asks that one of the weapons from the crate be put on the table, and taps it with her leg. "Powerful, the blasts from these are, but in need of some more broad, wider-impacting equipment, we are. Explosives. Fetch for us some grenades from human space, you could."`
	"CN-10941" `	"Alright, I'll help you. How many grenades do you need?"`
	"CN-10942" `	"No, I want no part in this. Bring me back to my ship."`
	"CN-10943" `	"<payment>. Pay you twice their cost, we would," she says as you're getting up. "A lot of money, you could make, if help us, you do."`
	"CN-10944" `	"Fine. How many grenades?"`
	"CN-10945" `	"No. Get me back to my ship."`
	"CN-10946" `	Her mandibles click together for a few seconds. "100 boxes. Brought to <planet>, they must be. The exact coordinates, upon arrival, you will receive." She pauses as the other Kimek put her prosthetics back on. "Chiree, my name is. Hoping, I am, that help us a great deal you will, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-10947" `	She heads back into the strange grouping of cubicles, and the Kimek behind you have you get up, putting the sack back on your head. After another ride in the unpleasantly tight elevator, and some more pushing and tugging at your body, they have you back at your ship. The sack is removed from your head and the Kimek walk off as if nothing happened. Nobody around the hangar seems to have noticed anything unusual.`
	"CN-10948" `	She breathes deeply for a moment, then asks the other Kimek to put her prosthetics back on. "Very well," she says, before walking back into the strange grouping of cubicles. The Kimek behind you have you get up, putting the sack back on your head. After another ride in the unpleasantly tight elevator, and some more pushing and tugging at your body, they have you back at your ship. The sack is removed from your head and the Kimek walk off as if nothing happened. Nobody around the hangar seems to have noticed anything unusual.`
	"CN-10949" `	While they're removing the crates from your hold, a familiar Kimek approaches you: it's Chiree, the local Lunarium leader. "Speak in your ship, may we, Captain?" You bring her inside <ship>, and she continues. "Since one of us, you now are, to help with acquiring some equipment, you I'd like to ask."`
	"CN-10950" `	"Was this 'charity' job just to get me here for this?"`
	"CN-10951" `	"This last one? Yes, wished to speak about this away from prying eyes, I did," she says. "Really in need of help, the people of Fourth Shadow were. Actual charity work, we still need to perform, if to keep up the disguise, we want. The second one... well, as you know, doctors, three of the Kimek were not."`
	"CN-10952" `	She explains that the crates you brought in were filled with Heliarch assault guns, meant to supply the members here with better weaponry. "Used the charity as a means of smuggling, for decades we have," she explains. "But difficult to acquire, larger Heliarch outfits are. Difficult to transport in secret. Capable of leaving, you are, so bring in outfits from the outside, you could." She tells you the Lunarium needs some explosives they could reproduce with relative ease, and use against the Heliarchs in boarding operations. They've been informed that not far from the Coalition, there are human worlds selling Fragmentation Grenades, which would do the job. "100 boxes of them, to <planet>, you must bring," she says. "Paid twice their value, you will be, <payment>."`
	"CN-10953" `	A communicator on her beeps, and she gets word that the workers have finished unloading the smuggled guns. She tells you you'll receive coordinates for delivering the grenades once you arrive at <planet>, and wishes you good luck.`
	"CN-10954" `As you approach the standard docking bay, a message pops up on your monitor telling you to go to the edge of the city. You follow the instructions and find yourself in the middle of several dozen warehouses. Another message arrives and asks that you unload the grenades and bring them to a specific warehouse. As this information comes in, you notice that a few Arachi have arrived just outside your ship with some cargo loaders, seemingly waiting for you to begin moving the smuggled weapons. You open up your hatch, and help them get the grenade crates out of your ship and into the designated warehouse as fast as you can, worried that someone might see you. The door is open, with a few more Arachi waiting inside by a staircase. They say nothing to you and simply take the grenade crates, lifting them off of the cargo loader and bringing them down the stairs, crate by crate.`
	"CN-10955" `	When you're done with the last one, one of the Arachi hands you several credit chips, worth <payment> in total. "Contact you for more deliveries of this kind, we will," they say as they head down with the final grenade box. You head back to your ship, and leave for the usual hangars.`
	"CN-10956" `Shortly after you land, an Arach approaches your ship, waiting for you to come out. When you do, she pulls out a Heliarch badge. "Forgive me for this intrusion, you must, Captain <last>, but orders to inspect your ship, I have." She heads inside your ship and rushes to the cockpit before you can say anything, and asks you to close the door once you get there too. Her eyes trail the interior for a while, then she approaches you. "Helped the Lunarium with supplies before, you have," she whispers. "In need of more such services, we are. Means to defend ourselves against the Heliarch missiles, we require, so sent to ask you for three of the largest human anti-missile turrets, I was."`
	"CN-10957" `	"Where should I take them to?"`
	"CN-10958" `	"I'm not sure human anti-missiles will be very effective against your missiles."`
	"CN-10959" `	"Brought to <destination>, they must be. The factories there, numerous and alike, they are. Hopes to produce our own, in secret, we have."`
	"CN-10960" `	"The simpler their mechanisms, the faster that replicate them, we can," she says. "Strong enough to stop the Finishers, I hope they are... Bring the turrets to <destination>, you must."`
	"CN-10961" `	She asks for your monitor, and, after tinkering with the controls for a minute, plugs a small, round device into it. "Allow us to more easily contact you, this will. Accessed by a separate network entirely, the device is. Simply a means to receive our messages, it is. Leave traces on its hardware, communications will not, and gain access to the network on its own, it cannot. Traced back to us, you won't be, unless caught by the Heliarchs during our communications, you are," she explains. "After delivered the goods to <planet>, you have, message you for more missions, we shall. Good luck I wish you, and my thanks you have, Captain." Once the "inspection" is done, she leaves your ship and scurries off.`
	"CN-10962" `Your monitor beeps loudly as you prepare for your descent onto <planet>, indicating that you have a message. The message details instructions on how to complete your delivery. Under the guise that you're transporting heavy factory equipment, you stop on a landing pad adjacent to a massive automated compound. A gantry crane moves the turrets down to ground levels, setting them on cargo platforms, which are then pulled into a large warehouse. Once all is done, you see that <payment> have been added to your account.`
	"CN-10963" `	You look to your monitor again, and see a message explaining the Lunarium would happily take more copies of smuggled equipment, if you wish to help further. The message details that they've prepared a method of integrating their missions into your job board. The device installed in your ship will include them in your list of regular jobs whenever they're available.`
	"CN-10964" `Once you land on <origin>, the little round drive the Lunarium member plugged into your ship beeps quietly. Your monitor begins to flicker, eventually changing to some sort of messaging interface. A few seconds pass, and some text pops up. "Greetings Captain! Chiree, it is. In need of your 'delivery services' again, we are. Told, we have been, that developed some torpedoes of their own, humans have, and while not as dangerous as Finishers, still provide us much needed offensive power against Heliarch ships, they would. Issued anti-missile defenses, they are not, so a great boon to us, these weapons would be."`
	"CN-10965" `	After you've read the message, you see a blinking circle at the bottom of your monitor, prompting you for some sort of response.`
	"CN-10966" `	"What weapons do you need?"`
	"CN-10967" `	"Where am I delivering the weapons?"`
	"CN-10968" `	You input the message, and get a response almost immediately; it seems Chiree's prosthetics don't negate the advantage of having so many legs typing in unison. "Two 'Torpedo Launchers' and two 'Typhoon Launchers' are what we need, along with the ammo to fill all of them. Brought to <planet>, they must be. There, our most adequate facilities for torpedoes are. Receive <payment> once you've delivered them there, you will."`
	"CN-10969" `	The interface blinks off, and the round drive stops beeping as your monitor returns to normal.`
	"CN-10970" `Once again, your monitor beeps, and some coordinates appear on the screen. You follow them, arriving to a snowfield close to the base of a mountain. Donning your heavy winter clothing, you open the hatch to find several Saryds waiting for you, ready to take the launchers and the ammunition out of your ship. "A better fighting chance, these should give us," one of them tells you as she hands you <payment>, and others work on getting the launchers and their ammunition out of your ship. "Not as mighty as their own Finishers, these are, but still hurt their hulls good, they should."`
	"CN-10971" `	"Are you sure they won't find you here?"`
	"CN-10972" `	"Why is it that their ships don't have anti-missiles?"`
	"CN-10973" `	She seems puzzled by the question, then her face sparks up as if remembering something. "Right, well-versed in our history, you are not," she begins. "Developed their arsenal to fight the Quarg, the Heliarchs have, and while possible, it was, to shoot down their projectiles, far too difficult a task, it proved. Favored more offensive turrets due to that, they historically have."`
	"CN-10974" `	"A calm world, this is, and many Heliarch patrols, it does not get," she explains. "Hidden many things here for long, we have. Continue to remain hidden, I hope we can."`
	"CN-10975" `	The final torpedo is brought out of your ship, and the Saryds start bringing them inside a cave leading into the mountain. The Saryd who paid you thanks you again, and follows after the others. You head back to your ship and fly it to the hangars, hoping to find something warm to drink.`
	"CN-10976" `Once again, the Lunarium's device starts beeping as you land, and your monitor flickers to the same messaging screen as last time. "Hello again Captain. Chiree, it is. Thank you for the torpedoes, I must, already at work on producing more like them, we are. Win us battles, however, they alone will not, so asking you to help us once again, I am. Received word, we have, of some more weapons developed by humans. Quickly heat up ships, they can, and so a great help against Heliarch attacks, they would be."`
	"CN-10977" `	"You have 'received word' of that? From whom? Who's telling you of these weapons?"`
	"CN-10978" `	For how fast she typed before, Chiree takes a long time to answer. "Know that, we do not," is what first appears on the screen. "First contacted centuries ago, we were. Unsure, we still are, if trustworthy, whoever is sending the messages is, but always right they are on their information. The first to bring us human outfits, you are not; whoever they are, brought us caches of some human platings and guns, decades ago, they did. Seen, their ships never were, only the crates and containers, we found."`
	"CN-10979" `	"So why do you trust these mystery informants so much?"`
	"CN-10980" `	"Whatever the case, just tell me what you need me to do."`
	"CN-10981" `	"Because helped us, they always have, and in dire need of help, we are," she shoots back in an instant. "Given us a fighting chance, they have," she adds.`
	"CN-10982" `	She quickly types out another message. "A larger delivery, this will be, so a good hiding spot, we'll need. To <destination>, bring two 'Plasma Turrets' and ten 'Flamethrowers' you must. Paid <payment>, you will be."`
	"CN-10983" `	The beeping stops and your monitor screen goes back to normal.`
	"CN-10984" `As you enter the planet's atmosphere you can't help but notice that much of the planet is covered in a dense, heavy fog. As you contemplate such an oddity, you get a message that guides you to land on a rocky beach, where a large cargo barge is waiting. Stepping off your ship, you're met by a few Saryds with the right equipment to get the Plasma Turrets and Flamethrowers out of your cargo hold. They do so with haste, handing you <payment> as they carry the turrets, and then Flamethrower after Flamethrower, off of your ship.`
	"CN-10985" `	"For your participation in our conjoined efforts, we thank you, <last>," one of them says when they are almost done. "If right, the information is, a tremendous boon to us, these weapons will be."`
	"CN-10986" `	"Are you sure this planet is an appropriate hiding spot? It doesn't seem to be exactly isolated."`
	"CN-10987" `	"How are the turrets and flamethrowers going to help, exactly?"`
	"CN-10988" `	He smiles at your question. "Lie hidden in the fog, many secrets do," he says, as if it were some adage. "Unknown even to most Saryds, parts of this planet are. Well hidden, the weapons will be. Worry about them, you need not."`
	"CN-10989" `	"If to fight the Heliarchs, we are, an advantage against their mighty vessels, we need," he explains. "When long in combat, close to their heat limit, their ships are. Greatly cripple them, we hope that these weapons will."`
	"CN-10990" `	He bids you farewell once the last Flamethrower is loaded onto the barge, and gets on it with the others to sail away. The barge is fully encompassed by the planet's ever-present fog within minutes of raising the anchor. You get inside your ship, and head to the usual hangars.`
	"CN-10991" `Landing on <origin>, the Lunarium's device starts beeping once again. Your monitor's screen shifts as you receive Chiree's message. "Captain <last>, a more complicated task for you, I have. Some better power generation, our ships will need, if to fight Heliarch warships, we are. Simpler to mass-produce, human ones should be, but only on <planet>, large enough facilities exist."`
	"CN-10992" `	"Why is that a problem? I already delivered the grenades to that planet."`
	"CN-10993" `	"Did something change about <planet>?"`
	"CN-10994" `	"Larger than other equipment you've brought us, these generators are," the next message says. "The 'Armageddon Core,' 'Fusion Reactor' and 'Breeder Reactor,' what we need are, but take a long time to move such large pieces, it will. Risk being seen, we cannot, so only in some days, delivered they may be. Switch every month, the rotating patrols do. Arrive on the fifth, new patrols usually do, so delivered during that window before the fifth, the reactors must be. Pay you well for this, we will, <payment>."`
	"CN-10995" `	She signs off, the beeping stops, and your monitor screen returns to normal.`
	"CN-10996" `When you come in to land, the local Lunarium contacts direct you to a site far away from any of the cities. You are led close to a gigantic cave entrance, on a valley already blanketed by the planet's typical heavy downpours. Dozens of Arachi and Kimek are waiting for you, and once you land they use hulking cargo loaders to carefully take each reactor from your ship, slowly bringing them inside the cave. They repeat this slow, arduous process with each reactor that you were tasked to bring to them.`
	"CN-10997" `	Most of those not working on moving the reactors are heavily armed, keeping careful watch of the skies and occasionally tuning into a communicator for any signs of Heliarch ships that may be approaching. After over an hour, once the last reactor is finally taken out of your cargo hold, one of the Arachi comes up to you and hands you <payment>, thanking you for your service to their cause. "A lot of money, this is, but worth it, the reactors should be."`
	"CN-10998" `	"Where do you even get all this money from?"`
	"CN-10999" `	"What are you even going to do with those reactors? It would be really hard to install them in a ship out here."`
	"CN-11000" `	"Word of our existence, the Heliarchs muffle, and distorted and twisted, their versions of our actions are, but enough to drive away our supporters, that is not," he says. "Not entirely... happy, some Arach Houses are, with the direction of things. Help fund us, they do."`
	"CN-11001" `	"Fit for battle, solar panels and fuel cells are not. Come to fight the Heliarchs, we eventually will, so better power generation for our weapons, we'll need," he says, and then points in the direction of the spaceport. "More efficient, Heliarch reactors are, but too difficult to steal them, it is. Too risky. Only provide energy for our facilities, they do. Studied and reproduced for use in our ships, the reactors you brought us will be."`
	"CN-11002" `	They bid you farewell and head into the cave, and you get back inside your ship. Once you land back at the city hangars, the device installed in your monitor beeps again with a message from Chiree. "Helped us a great deal you have, Captain <last>. Contact you like this again, I may not, but find more offers for smuggling jobs, you will. Appreciated, any more equipment you bring us will be, and of course, pay well we would." She signs off, and the beeps stop.`
	"CN-11003" `An Arach stops you by the spaceport and invites you to a free meal at a local bar. "A business proposal for you, my employers have."`
	"CN-11004" `	"Very well, lead the way."`
	"CN-11005" `	"Can't you just give me the details here? I'm not hungry."`
	"CN-11006" `	He seems somewhat disappointed, but agrees nonetheless. "A messenger from the great House Bebliss, I am. Expressed a wish to see you, my employers have, for a great aid to one of their projects, you would be."`
	"CN-11007" `	"What do they want?"`
	"CN-11008" `	"Did they mention how much I would get paid?"`
	"CN-11009" `	"Know such exact details, I do not, but certain, I am, that answer any of your questions, they will. Much interest in your resourcefulness, my superiors have," he says. "On <destination>, they wait. Now, told to tell you, I was, that only to speak with you, they want. To make an offer. If uninterested, you are, pressure you any further, they will not."`
	"CN-11010" `	"Fair enough. Tell them I'll be heading there to hear them out."`
	"CN-11011" `	"I won't go out of my way just to hear about a job offer. Tell them to come in person next time."`
	"CN-11012" `	He nods in some quick gesture, and gives you some coordinates. "To an estate, these will bring you. Thankful for your understanding, House Bebliss is." He runs off, and heads into an office building to inform his superiors that you'll be on your way to <planet>.`
	"CN-11013" `	You follow him into the establishment and order something. "To business, then," he says. "A messenger from the great House Bebliss, I am. Expressed a wish to see you, my employers have, for a great aid to one of their projects, you would be."`
	"CN-11014" `	He nods in some quick gesture, and gives you some coordinates. "To an estate, these will bring you. Thankful for your understanding, House Bebliss is." He finishes up his drink quickly, and leaves the bar to inform his superiors that you'll be on your way to <planet>.`
	"CN-11015" `On your way to the spaceport, you're stopped by a duo who seem to be Arachi businessmen, surrounded by half a dozen bulky, taller Arachi. "In person, as per your request, we have come, Captain," one of the two in fancy suits says.`
	"CN-11016" `	"My request? What are you talking about?"`
	"CN-11017" `	"You've got the wrong person. I don't know either of you."`
	"CN-11018" `	"House Bebliss, right? Thank you for finally finding the time."`
	"CN-11019" `	"To our employee, what you said, it is," they answer. "To 'come in person next time,' you requested."`
	"CN-11020" `	They "invite" you to follow you into what looks like an expensive restaurant, serving typical Arach cuisine. The bulky Arachi don't give you much of a choice, barring you from going elsewhere and only letting up when you are seated. The two Arachi businessmen say they will pay for your meal, though you can't quite find much in the menu appealing to the human palate.`
	"CN-11021" `	"Usually more... respectful about such requests from our House, people are, but hasty of us to approach a human Captain like we would an Arach one, it may have been," one of them says, going through the menu. "Still interested, the House is, so to entertain your request, we came."`
	"CN-11022" `	"Interested in your assistance, that is," the other continues, as he signals for one of the bodyguards to get a waiter. "An important job for you, we have."`
	"CN-11023" `	"Alright, you have my interest. What's this job about?"`
	"CN-11024" `	"Well, if you want me to work with you so much, why don't you just tell me what the job is?"`
	"CN-11025" `	"I'm sorry, I understand you've taken the effort to come meet me in person, but I've got pressing business outside of Coalition space."`
	"CN-11026" `	"Second chance, tenth chance, I really don't care how many you give me. I'm not interested."`
	"CN-11027" `	"Say much, here we cannot," he answers. "If interested, you are, to <destination>, you must go. There, our House's private estate is."`
	"CN-11028" `	"That it concerns recent human events, we can say. Events that involved in, you were," the other says, handing you some coordinates to their estate on <planet>.`
	"CN-11029" `	The waiter arrives, and they suggest some dishes, seeing as you didn't pick anything from the menu. The smell coming from the other tables, however, tells you to decline, so you politely leave the establishment. It seems the only way to find out what these Arachi want is to head to <destination>.`
	"CN-11030" `	The two of them eye you up for a very uncomfortable minute, but never provide some response or acknowledgment. You try and move away and leave the restaurant, but their bodyguards block you. One of the two Arachi from the table appears to grunt, then signals for the guards to let you pass through. You leave the restaurant, and return to your ship.`
	"CN-11031" `You follow the coordinates given to you and land on top of a mountain at a set of private hangars. Nearby is an estate, covered by a dome similar to the one over the spaceport city. You are received by who you assume are Arachi butlers and maids, given their tidy, well-kept uniforms, and follow one of them into the mansion.`
	"CN-11032" `	They bring you to a large, wide room where three preoccupied Arachi are pouring over schematics and blueprints scattered across a table.`
	"CN-11033" `	"Captain <first> <last>!" One of them comes to greet you after the servant announces your arrival. "A rare opportunity, it is, such an exquisite guest, to entertain. Care for a drink, would you?" Without waiting for a response, one of the maids brings over a platter with several cups, and you're pleasantly surprised to discover familiar smells like coffee and tea coming from the silver dish. You notice that there are also some alcoholic beverages as well as just plain water in the middle of the platter.`
	"CN-11034" `	"Difficult to replicate, some of these human drinks were, but for a special guest, the least we could do, it is," another one approaches, gesturing for you to pick one of the drinks, while signaling for another maid to bring him and the other two some drinks of their own.`
	"CN-11035" `	"Thank you, but why exactly did you want to talk to me so badly?"`
	"CN-11036" `	"You asked me to come here for a job. What is the job?"`
	"CN-11037" `	"The great House Bebliss, we represent. Maintain the local hyperspace communication network, our House does," he says as he swirls the drink in his cup before taking a sip.`
	"CN-11038" `	The other one jumps in. "Studied hyperspace links, for millennia we have. More recently, an application of such phenomena that would help the Coalition, we have searched for."`
	"CN-11039" `	"To be trusted, you are. Assured us of that, Chiree has," the one Arach still by the blueprints chimes in. "The Lunarium's guardian angels, we are," she boasts. "Safeguard them against the Heliarchs, our meddling in the communication network does. To better serve that purpose, look further into this field, we must."`
	"CN-11040" `	Still gently swirling his drink in between periodic sips, the other Arach beside you asks, "Knowledge, we have acquired, of a certain conflict in human space. Invaded by aliens, were you? Aliens with such technology?"`
	"CN-11041" `	"Yes, they're called Pug."`
	"CN-11042" `	"Wait, how do you know of this?"`
	"CN-11043" `	"Know it, the Heliarchs do, so learned about it, we have."`
	"CN-11044" `	"Many resources, our great House possesses," the Arach still by the table adds. "Trivial to acquire such information, for us it is."`
	"CN-11045" `	"I see. Well, yes, we were invaded by aliens known as the Pug."`
	"CN-11046" `	"And how did the Heliarchy know?"`
	"CN-11047" `	"In 'their' space, are you not? Scanned by their ships, you were. Subtly amassed, your flight records, your charted map of the galaxy, were," she finishes, and looks to you along with the other two, waiting for your answer.`
	"CN-11048" `	"In 'their' space, are you not? Scanned by their ships, you were. Subtly amassed, your flight records, your charted map of the galaxy, were," she finishes. "Of course, register any such logs, your ship does not, when running tasks or simply coming to meet us like this, you are. Permit them find our bases that easily, we must not. But, digress I do. Please Captain, intrigued about these aliens, we very much are." She gestures toward you with one leg, as the other Bebliss members eye you eagerly.`
	"CN-11049" `	"Human space was invaded by a species known as the Pug."`
	"CN-11050" `	Thankfully, the ones that were downing drinks weren't that close when you said the word "Pug," or else you'd need a new set of clothes. One of them signals for a maid to clean up their simultaneous spit takes, and the Arach by the blueprints finally comes closer.`
	"CN-11051" `	"'Pug,' were they called?" she asks as the maid behind her quickly scrubs the floor. You confirm it, and she calls for a servant, asking them to ready a ship. She whispers something to the other two members of House Bebliss, which the translation devices don't pick up, and starts gathering her belongings. "To forgive me, I ask you, Captain, but leave at once, I must."`
	"CN-11052" `	Once she's left, one of the other two asks for more details, so you give them a brief rundown of the Pug invasion and how humanity managed to fight them off. They ask you to further detail the moments where you had to fight off waves of Pug as Freya worked the graviton transmitters and reflectors to link back to other human systems.`
	"CN-11053" `	"Promising, this Freya woman sounds. Know her location, do you, Captain?"`
	"CN-11054" `	You say that she is probably still on <destination>, and that when you saw her last, she was studying what artifacts the Pug left on the planet.`
	"CN-11055" `	"Speak with this woman, would you, Captain? If willing to work with us, she is, greatly rewarded, you would be."`
	"CN-11056" `	"I'll go talk with her and see what I can do."`
	"CN-11057" `	"Sorry, but I don't want to bother her by pulling her into the Coalition's business."`
	"CN-11058" `	They thank you, and head to another room asking you to wait. One of the maids offers you a choice of another one of the human drinks, while the one holding the platter with drinks that the House Bebliss members were savoring stands like a statue near a corner.`
	"CN-11059" `	(Taste some of the human drinks.)`
	"CN-11060" `	(Ask for one of the Arach drinks.)`
	"CN-11061" `	(Just wait for my hosts to come back.)`
	"CN-11062" `	You politely decline the drinks, and the maid gives you a brief nod, silently going back to her post to stand still like the other. You go over to the table to look at the blueprints, seeing many charts drawn and symbols resembling calculations on one corner, but you can't understand what's written. You sit as best as you can on what you guess is an Arach equivalent to an armchair, looking around the room for a few minutes.`
	"CN-11063" `	Though House Bebliss seemed surprised with your talk about the Pug, they seem to know human drinks all too well. The coffee, while not too strong, still holds that distinct, slightly bitter taste. The tea, which appears to be chamomile, is as soothing as you remember it being the last time you had the drink. The variety of juices available all have a natural, sweet taste to them, save for the peach juice, which you avoided given that its consistency seemed to be closer to pudding than juice and oozed over the lip as you tilted the cup.`
	"CN-11064" `	You wave for the maid with the Arach drinks, and she looks to the other maid in surprise. She tries explaining to you that she isn't sure if these drinks are meant for human consumption. Regardless, you insist, so she reluctantly walks over, handing you one of the cups. You bring it to your nose, and an overwhelming aroma hits your nostrils. The drink somehow smells oddly similar to the feeling you have in your mouth after waking up extremely parched after a long night of sleep. You carefully sip some of it, bringing the cup away from your mouth once the liquid hits your tongue. The sweetness has a sting to it, as if it's lightly biting your tongue as it travels through your mouth. Swallowing it, your throat feels a worrying numbing sensation for several seconds. You put the cup back on the platter, and the maids move away. After about a minute, you start struggling to keep your eyes open. Your surroundings suddenly appear much brighter than before, as if the lights in the ceiling have somehow intensified their output and the colors on everything around you have sharpened their image. You close your eyes for a few minutes to gain your bearings, and everything seems to go back to normal.`
	"CN-11065" `	When your hosts return, they hand you a small suitcase of sorts. "Translated our proposal into your language, we have," one of them says. "Bring that to Miss Freya, you must. Hopeful, we are, that willing to share the research material with us, she is."`
	"CN-11066" `	"Also inside, certain... research papers are. A gift, she may consider it," the other adds.`
	"CN-11067" `	"Also inside, certain... research papers are. A gift, she may consider it," the other adds. "And, Captain, one last thing. Realize we do that in order to explain it all to her, inevitably tell Miss Freya of the Coalition, you will. Only, ask of you, I must, that reveal anything about the Lunarium, you do not. A bordering human world the Heliarchs periodically visit, and no means of culling what information they there gain, we have. Safer, it will be, if keep the Redoubt a secret, you do."`
	"CN-11068" `	They say they will be waiting in the estate for her response, and have the servants escort you back to your ship.`
	"CN-11069" `	They stare at you in surprise for a bit, glancing at one another a few times. They sigh. "Very well, understandable, that is," one of them says. They ask for some more drinks, and have some servants escort you back to your ship.`
	"CN-11070" `You look around for Freya, asking the local dock workers to point you in the direction of the people researching the Pug tech. They direct you to a quieter, less crowded place, where some warehouse complexes have been set up. Some are painted in the usual Syndicate colors, some are guarded by a few Navy troops, and a Free Worlds flag flies by the entrance of the one you enter. Inside, you see groups of people surrounding the various artifacts that the Pug left behind. Some of them are running complicated looking tests, but it seems that they are mostly discussing what to do with the artifacts next. One of the graviton transmitters sits opposite to the entrance, half intact, half dismantled, with an array of scientists poking and prodding the machinery inside.`
	"CN-11071" `	Freya is atop a ladder near the transmitter when she sees you. She quickly hops down from her perch and runs toward you. "<first>! It's nice to see you again. What brings you here?" You tell her you have some important matters to discuss, and she has you follow her to an office-like room packed with tools and components.`
	"CN-11072" `	You give her a rundown of the Coalition, explaining about the three species, the Heliarchs and their fight against the Quarg, and about who House Bebliss is, handing her the suitcase when you're done.`
	"CN-11073" `	(Tell her everything, including the Lunarium.)`
	"CN-11074" `	(Don't mention the Lunarium.)`
	"CN-11075" `	You give her a quick rundown of the Coalition, explaining about the three species, the Heliarchs and their fight against the Quarg, the Lunarium Redoubt and their intentions to overthrow the Heliarchy, and the part House Bebliss plays in that, handing her the suitcase when you're done.`
	"CN-11076" `	"Well, at least these ones are asking if they can come invade us," she jokes as she lays the suitcase on a table, opening it. "Three alien species, huh? We were picking up some degraded radio signals from these systems, before the war even, so I figured there was someone out there." She begins to read the message House Bebliss prepared for her, frowning right at the start. "You didn't write this, did you?" You shake your head. "Thought so. The words are... jumbled?"`
	"CN-11077" `	"Oh, that. You get used to it."`
	"CN-11078" `	"It's not so bad when you're talking with them in person."`
	"CN-11079" `	She gives the message an odd look, lets out an "if you say so," and continues to read it. "If this 'House Bebliss' is as advanced as they claim in this, I don't see how I could help them with anything, but they're offering to share their knowledge with me in return, so I won't complain. If nothing else it'll be an experience, working with giant spiders."`
	"CN-11080" `	"So you're fine with letting them study the Pug artifacts with you?"`
	"CN-11081" `	"I can go back and tell them you've agreed then?"`
	"CN-11082" `	"Have you told the others about this?" Freya asks, and you tell her you haven't. "Alondo, JJ... they need to know about this 'Coalition,'" continues Freya, "even if they've no intention of invading us. JJ is stationed on <planet> currently, so I'll send word to him that we'll be heading there to meet with him. You can give us the whole situation, all details you've found out, there."`
	"CN-11083" `	You follow her back out of the room, and she tells the workers there she'll be heading away with you to <planet> to discuss some matters with JJ. They wish you a good trip, and you head out of the building and into a small residential area near the warehouse, built for the workers during their stay here. You help Freya pack her things while she messages JJ, and you two head to your ship. "When you're done, you can go pick up these Arachi and bring them here. On our way to <planet>, and while you're away getting them, I'll have some time to look at what they've sent me."`
	"CN-11084" `	You show her to her bunk once you're inside your ship, and plot a course for <destination>.`
	"CN-11085" `JJ is waiting for you two when you land, wearing a uniform with various medals and honors on his chest. He greets Freya with a handshake, then turns to you. "It was nice to hear from Freya that you'd be stopping to pay us a visit. Well, until she started going on about how you had some 'critical' information, that is," he says as he shakes your hand, sighing gently. "So much for taking a break from managing fleets."`
	"CN-11086" `	"Sorry about that. It's nice to see you too, JJ."`
	"CN-11087" `	"Well, you won't need to worry about anything being 'critical' too much when it comes to these aliens. Hopefully."`
	"CN-11088" `	"Hopefully? Wait, aliens?!" He gives you a mix between a worried look and a stern face. "Let's just go talk in my office. I'm guessing this is going to be a long story."`
	"CN-11089" `	He beckons you to follow him to a traffic shuttle, which eventually brings you to a towering government building. As you get closer, you notice the main courtyard is home to a multitude of different colored flags, all of them situated around the Free Worlds' own. "Planetary flags," JJ says as you both get out of the shuttle. "Some of our planets created their own recently, and some of the more diplomatic folks decided to set them up around the major government buildings." Leaving the flags waving in the breeze, the three of you head inside the building and go up an elevator, arriving on a floor with a couple rooms to the side and a larger one opposite the elevator. You enter the larger room and see a nice wooden desk, which JJ heads to, sitting behind it, as Freya takes a seat on the sofa.`
	"CN-11090" `	"Well, here we are. What is this 'critical information' you've found, Captain <last>?"`
	"CN-11091" `	"Some more aliens."`
	"CN-11092" `	"I hope none of you are afraid of spiders."`
	"CN-11093" `	(Explain everything, including the Lunarium.)`
	"CN-11094" `	JJ quietly listens as you explain to him all you've learned about the Coalition. You bring up a map of the Free Worlds and show him and Freya the rough area of Coalition space and where it borders Free Worlds territory. As you gesture toward the map, you tell them of the three species, about the Heliarchs and how they've taken the three Quarg rings. Eventually you get to the Arach Houses, explaining that House Bebliss are the ones who wish to go study the Pug artifacts with Freya.`
	"CN-11095" `	When you're done, JJ is the first to speak up. "So far, we seem to be getting along better with these aliens than we did with the Pug. It's good that they're trying to be diplomatic, though I'm not sure it'd be a good idea for the general public to know of them, given past experiences. At least for right now."`
	"CN-11096" `	"Do they have jump drives?" Freya asks. You nod, but say that they can't make their own. "Well, as long as what stockpile they have isn't too large, we shouldn't be in too much trouble."`
	"CN-11097" `	"Except they took three Quarg rings," JJ chimes in. "They've beaten the Quarg? So they're stronger than the Quarg? More advanced?" He asks.`
	"CN-11098" `	"No, but their ships are still a lot tougher than human ones."`
	"CN-11099" `	"No, but they do outnumber humans - all humans."`
	"CN-11100" `	"The Quarg would never just abandon their rings, and do you know how many Quarg are in one ring alone? There's no way they would have lost three of them like that," Freya says. "They'll want those rings back, that's certain."`
	"CN-11101" `	"And we're right between this 'Coalition' and the Quarg near Tarazed." JJ points at the map. "If they decide to go get their rings back, and our neighbors decide to use their jump drives to create a buffer before the Quarg hit them on their home turf..."`
	"CN-11102" `	They stay silent for a while, then JJ picks up the talk again. "If the Quarg have waited six thousand years, then they might wait a few thousand more. What matters now is that we know of these aliens, meaning we must start thinking about possible outcomes to all of this and what they mean for the Free Worlds. If we start preparations now, perhaps we'll get lucky and we won't get caught up in any other wars; especially wars involving the Quarg."`
	"CN-11103" `	JJ quietly listens as you explain to him all you've learned about the Coalition. You bring up a map of the Free Worlds and show him and Freya the rough area of Coalition space and where it borders Free Worlds territory. As you gesture toward the map, you tell them of the three species, about the Heliarchs and how they've taken the three Quarg rings. Eventually you get to the Arach Houses, explaining that House Bebliss are the ones who wish to go study the Pug artifacts with Freya. You also tell them about the Lunarium, explaining the group's actions and their wish to take down the Heliarch government, and what role House Bebliss has in helping them.`
	"CN-11104" `	When you're done, JJ is the first to speak up. "So far, we seem to be getting along better with these aliens than we did with the Pug. It's good that they're trying to be diplomatic, though I'm not sure it'd be a good idea for the general public to know of them, given past experiences. At least for right now." He pauses, then addresses you directly. "It's... bold of you to want to help this resistance group of theirs. There's some sympathy given the Free Worlds' own history, but they sound like they have an even worse shot than what we had."`
	"CN-11105" `	"Whatever their government is, or whether it's overthrown or not, it doesn't change that they're right at our doorstep," Freya says. "Do they have jump drives?" she asks. You nod, but say that they can't make their own. "Well, as long as what stockpile they have isn't too large, we shouldn't be in too much trouble."`
	"CN-11106" `	"The Quarg would never just abandon their rings, and do you know how many Quarg are in one ring alone? There's no way they would have lost three of them like that," Freya says. "They'll want those rings back, no matter what faction is holding them."`
	"CN-11107" `	"Well, if <first> and this 'Lunarium Redoubt' succeed, it probably won't come to that, from what I've gathered," Freya says.`
	"CN-11108" `	"And if they don't? Then a human tried to help the rebels in their space overthrow them. A human that worked for the Free Worlds," JJ responds. "I'm not blaming you, <first>, but we don't know what these 'Heliarchs' will do if you fail. If they figure out how to make their own jump drives, or worse, learn how to cut off our systems like the Pug did..."`
	"CN-11109" `	They stay silent for a while, then Freya picks up the talk again. "If this rebel group never came to be, we could eventually be caught up in a war between the Heliarchs and the Quarg. If they succeed, we won't need to worry about that, at least. If they fail, and the Heliarchs retaliate against humanity, we ask the Quarg for help. At least, with <first> helping these rebels, there's a chance we won't get caught up in a war between the Heliarchs and the Quarg."`
	"CN-11110" `	JJ thinks for a bit. "Fair enough, but it's still worrying."`
	"CN-11111" `	JJ makes a few calls, arranging some meetings to inform Free Worlds officials of what you've told him, then heads out with you and Freya. You go to a cozy restaurant near the center of town, where Freya tells you a bit more of her recent work in Deneb, and JJ laments about some trouble he's been having with handling patrol fleets. He also comments on having visited Katya and Ijs in the Conservatory somewhat recently. They both keep asking you to tell more of your travels with the jump drive, and what you've seen of the galaxy. You do your best to describe the stars you've seen and planets you've been to, as well as the alien wildlife you've encountered. You worry at first that the stories might draw some attention to your table, but the waiters and other customers don't seem to pay much mind; either they ignored you or simply brushed it off as you having had too many drinks. You leave at dusk, and Freya says she'll help JJ in some of the talks with the Free Worlds officials, and will later find her own way back to Deneb. You say your goodbyes to them, and head back to your ship. You should return to <planet> now and tell House Bebliss that Freya's agreed to their proposal.`
	"CN-11112" `Landing beside an Arach Spindle, you maneuver your ship to House Bebliss' estate, and are once again welcomed by maids and butlers. They show you to a room where the same three Arachi from last time are.`
	"CN-11113" `	"Agreed to work with us, has she, Captain?" they ask.`
	"CN-11114" `	You tell them that Freya has agreed to work with them and let them study the Pug artifacts she has collected on Deneb. You also explain that she asked you to inform the Free Worlds about the Coalition first.`
	"CN-11115" `	"Understandable, that is. An unusual request, from an unknown group, it was." They have some of the servants start carrying dozens of luggage bags outside. "If in agreement, Miss Freya is, head to that planet, 'Deneb,' to meet her, we shall."`
	"CN-11116" `	"How do you plan to do that?"`
	"CN-11117" `	"Do you have a jump drive?"`
	"CN-11118" `	"From the Heliarchs, much information our House can gather. Much more difficult, however, acquiring a jump drive is. Risky to possess one, even," they explain. "Assist us on that front, you must, Captain. Bring a jump drive to <destination>, you must. Equip one of our ships with it, we will. Receive <payment>, you will."`
	"CN-11119" `	"Why can't I just bring you to Deneb myself?"`
	"CN-11120" `	"But you just said it's risky to possess one."`
	"CN-11121" `	"Indeed. Keep it, we would not," another one responds. "Once concluded, our business with your friend Freya is, and returned, we have, give you back the jump drive, we would."`
	"CN-11122" `	"Stay there for some months, we will, and though agreed to help us, your friend Freya has, troubled by our presence, other humans may be," they respond. "So that issues with accommodating us, she does not have, use our ship as a base, we will."`
	"CN-11123" `	You follow them outside, and see them board the Spindle, heading to <destination>. You board your own ship, and head back to the city docks, preparing to meet them on <planet> when you have a spare jump drive for their ship.`
	"CN-11124" `Some coordinates are automatically selected when you approach the surface of <planet>. You follow them to reach another private area of sorts, though it looks much more like a factory or a warehouse than an estate. On the corners, several flags and banners of House Idriss are in full display. House Bebliss' Spindle is landed there, and the members who will be following you to Deneb come to your ship when you land beside it. Some workers remove the jump drive from your ship and begin installing it on the Spindle. The House Bebliss members crewing the ship hand you <payment> when the drive is ready.`
	"CN-11125" `	"Once ready to leave, you are, meet us in the main spaceport, you should," one of them says.`
	"CN-11126" `One of the employees of House Bebliss spots you immediately as you enter the spaceport and guides you to what they claim is one of the top restaurants here. The members of the House are waiting inside, the only patrons within the establishment. Having already ordered their meals when you arrive, they offer to buy you anything you want from the menu. Seeing the selection of "exotic dishes" on the other tables, though, you decide to decline their offer.`
	"CN-11127" `	"Ready for takeoff, our ship is," one of them says, preparing some napkins as the waiters bring their orders to the table. "To the world where your friend is, bring us, you must."`
	"CN-11128" `	Another one bites into something that looks like a goat's leg, albeit much bonier, before saying, "Prepared for concealing our presence, we and the crew are. Worry about that, you need not."`
	"CN-11129" `	"Extra fuel, the ship has. Enough to reach the planet, it should be," the last of them tells you. You stay at the restaurant for a surprisingly short while, as the Arachi devour the full-course meals in only a few minutes. You leave together, accompanying them to the hangars, where you see their Spindle landing next to the <ship>. They board it, saying they will follow your ship once you depart, and that you may take off at your earliest convenience.`
	"CN-11130" `As both your ships come in for a landing, you contact Freya and tell her the Arachi are with you this time. She tells you to land near the Free Worlds' warehouses, where you last met her, saying she'll be waiting there to greet them.`
	"CN-11131" `	When you arrive, you wait outside your ship while House Bebliss' ship keeps its hatch closed. It seems they intend to remain in there for the duration of their stay, most likely in fear that their appearance would cause a stir amongst other humans.`
	"CN-11132" `	A few minutes later Freya arrives, and you two approach the Spindle's hatch. Once House Bebliss is satisfied with making sure no curious bystanders are nearby, the hatch opens, and you two go into the ship. Though you've grown used to Arach ships by now, Freya's eyes dart around the interiors as you move within the ship. You imagine she's holding in the desire to ask you some technical questions about the model. When you arrive at the cockpit, you're greeted by the members of House Bebliss. Despite you having told her about them previously, Freya is understandably taken aback for a second or two upon first seeing the Arachi, but soon shakes it off, confidently walking up to greet them. "Hello, my name is Freya Winters. I've heard you're interested in the Pug artifacts we found on this world." Despite the initial shock in meeting them, for someone speaking with giant spiders for the first time she handles it surprisingly well.`
	"CN-11133" `	"Indeed. The trade of our great House Bebliss for thousands of years, the study of hyperlanes has been," one of the Arachi says. "When tell us of your achievements, Captain <last> did, know that we needed to come look into your work ourselves, we did."`
	"CN-11134" `	She quickly gets used to the translation box's odd speech quirk, as she and the members of House Bebliss discuss how to go about helping each other in researching the artifacts here. One of the crew members approaches you as they talk and hands you <payment>. "Thanks for the safe escort here, this is," they whisper.`
	"CN-11135" `	Freya's talk with them goes on for almost an hour. They eventually settle on having some of the artifacts moved to their ship's cargo hold, so that some research can happen there without the risk of being seen. House Bebliss' representatives thank her for the reception, and you follow her back outside.`
	"CN-11136" `	Once the hatch is closed, she asks, "This is one of their freighter ships?"`
	"CN-11137" `	"Yeah, though it's not their largest one."`
	"CN-11138" `	"They're civilians, so they can't buy the warships in their space."`
	"CN-11139" `	"It's definitely a lot leaner than most of our own freighters, for a ship of its size." She turns around, and approaches the ship, reaching her hands up to touch it. "Looks like it's got some very tough armor plating..."`
	"CN-11140" `	"You think they'll be well hidden here?"`
	"CN-11141" `	"You think they'll be safe here?"`
	"CN-11142" `	"What about the Republic and the Syndicate? Will you tell the teams here about the Arachi?"`
	"CN-11143" `	"Well, <planet> has surged in population, for sure, but it's far from a tourist hotspot for now," she answers. "As long as they stick to that ship, no one should know they're here."`
	"CN-11144" `	"<planet> is close enough to Sol that we get Navy fleets flying by here pretty often, and it's far away enough from the pirate strongholds that we rarely get any of them raiding here. They'll be fine."`
	"CN-11145" `	"That's up to JJ, Alondo, and others more involved with Bourne and the Senate to decide. I imagine once they've put together a report of all you've told us, we'll be sharing that with the Republic and Syndicate. Probably best to avoid letting it out to the public right away though; there's still a lot of tension about aliens due to the Pug invasion."`
	"CN-11146" `	She moves away from the ship, and you both leisurely walk back to the Free Worlds' warehouse, chatting as you go. "I need to go tell my team that we're moving some of the load to Southbound's new experimental freighter. I'd prefer to tell them what's going on myself - it makes things so much easier - but I think I'll wait a little longer before doing that. I want to see if I can get a good reading on these aliens first. Perhaps another scientific conversation would help. I'll be in contact if something happens. Safe travels, <first>."`
	"CN-11147" `	You say goodbye, and head to your ship. From the looks of it, it might take some months, if not years, before House Bebliss gets what information they wanted out of this trip.`
	"CN-11148" `You receive a message from Freya as you land on <origin>. "Hello <first>! I hope this finds you well. The past few months here have been... interesting, to say the least. Working with the Arachi has helped us find answers to the questions we had about the Pug artifacts, which invariably has led to more questions. The Arachi are a bit odd, but it's been fun working with them. I figured they would stay here for at least a year, given how many containers and large crates of supplies they brought in that freighter of theirs, but it looks like they've grown homesick, so we said our goodbyes today. They asked me to contact you and say they'll be waiting in a system called '<system>' to pay you and return the jump drive they borrowed. Have a safe trip there, Captain."`
	"CN-11149" `	When you finish reading the message, you plot a course to <destination>.`
	"CN-11150" `Once again, coordinates appear on your screen as you come in to land on <planet>, leading you to the same building where you delivered the jump drive to House Bebliss. Their Arach Spindle is docked there, and the members who were working with Freya come to your ship. "Captain <last>!" One of them greets you as you come down the hatch. "Received the message from Miss Freya, I trust you have? Very fruitful, our conjoined efforts have been."`
	"CN-11151" `	"Unfortunate, it is, that stay there longer we could not," another one interjects. "But away for much longer, we could not be. Need us here, House Bebliss does."`
	"CN-11152" `	They hand you <payment> as thanks for all your help, while the workers remove the jump drive from their Spindle and put it in your ship. The Arachi thank you once more and say goodbye one final time, boarding their Spindle and leaving the planet.`
	"CN-11153" `A few Kimek flag you down by the spaceport entrance. "Greetings, Captain. Work for a tourism company employing dozens of ships across the Coalition we do. Interested in employing your services, our captain is. You see, run into some trouble with the deadline, one of our ships has, and pay you handsomely for aiding the company, she would. Waiting inside that Spire, she is," they say, as they point to a ship parked not too far from your own.`
	"CN-11154" `	"Alright, I'll see if I can help."`
	"CN-11155" `	"Can't you just point me the way yourselves?"`
	"CN-11156" `	"Sorry, I'm not available at the moment."`
	"CN-11157" `	One of the Kimek cowers his legs closer to his body for a moment. "Actually, just short of running late to a mission of our own, we are. Crew of another ship we are; merely told to contact you for help, we were. Too busy managing the rest of the fleet, she is."`
	"CN-11158" `	"A very busy season for us, it has been," another one adds. "Discuss the details, and your compensation, the captain will."`
	"CN-11159" `	One of them brings you to the Spire, sending a message as you two head there, and the hatch is opened right as you arrive. They thank you for helping, and rush to board their own ship and depart. You go up the Spire's ramp and meet some more Kimek from the company, who greet you and guide you through the ship. Halfway through a corridor, they stop and ask that you wait there. A different Kimek carrying nearly a dozen different devices emerges from a side corridor, and the group begins patting and circling your body with the devices. You ask them what they're doing, but they don't respond. After every single one of the machines has finished its beeps and chirps around you, and the Kimek seem satisfied, they continue on. Surprisingly, they bring you not to the cockpit, but to one of the bunks, where a Kimek is talking with a Saryd man. Once she sees you're there, the Kimek gives a glance to the Saryd, and leaves with the others, leaving you two alone.`
	"CN-11160" `	Middle-aged, the Saryd has little hair on his head and a dense beard. "Greetings, human friend. <first> <last> your name is, correct?" You nod. "Apologize I do, for the safety measures experienced, you must have. You see, rather sickly lately, I have been, and while usually fine around Kimek or Arach employees and passengers, wish to try my health against a Saryd or human disease, I did not. But, come to listen of my woes, you have not. Called Elirom, and owner of this company, I am. For those wishing to travel in leisure or for work, provide comfortable ships we do," he explains. "Run into some trouble, one of our ships has. Supposed to transport <bunks> students and teachers back to Second Viridian after their school trip was done, but now waiting for repairs for the ship's malfunctioning outfits, they are. Picked up by <date>, the students must be, so as to not miss their tests, but elsewhere busy, our other ships are. Pick them up in our stead, would you? <payment> from our company, you will receive."`
	"CN-11161" `	"Sure, where am I picking them up from?"`
	"CN-11162" `	"I'm sorry, but I'm not interested anymore."`
	"CN-11163" `	"Waiting on <planet> they are. Inform them to expect your ship, I will. Remember, picked up before <date> they must be." He bends his front legs lightly in a bow, thanking you for agreeing to help, and asks for one of the Kimek to come back and escort you out. They repeat the same tedious search process with the devices on your way out, and wish you good luck when they're finally done.`
	"CN-11164" `	Middle-aged, with little hair on his head and a dense beard, you switftly recognize the Saryd as Elirom, one of the Lunarium leaders you met on Remote Blue. "Hello Captain <last>, good to see you it is. Forgive me for the convoluted security measures, you must, always listening they are..." He rubs one hand over the other while glancing down. "Looking for our members all over <planet>, Heliarch ships are. Received word, I have, that arrive there by <date>, many more Punishers will. If get there they do before evacuated our members, we have, afraid I am that unfeasible to save them, it will become. Still waiting for a ship, <bunks> of them are, and get back there before the Punishers arrive on <date>, our other ships will not. Captain, help us, you must. Compensate you with <payment>, I will."`
	"CN-11165" `	"Of course, I'll head there right away."`
	"CN-11166" `	"Can't they just lay low until the Punishers have gone away?"`
	"CN-11167" `	"No, no," he shakes his head. "Find them out, they would. They always do." His eyes wander around, as he takes a step back. He blinks repeatedly for a second, then looks back at you. "Seen what they do to the prisoners they take, I have, Captain. If there they remain, found they will be, and lost <bunks> more, I would have."`
	"CN-11168" `	He has one of the Kimek come back to escort you out, but before you leave the room, he adds, "Students and their teachers, they are. Picking them up from a school trip, after canceled on them, the original transport did, you are. Bring them back home to Second Viridian for their tests, you will. Asked to do so by the captain of the original transport ship, you were." He urges you to go there as soon as possible to pick them up, and the Kimek take you back out, repeating the same security search in the hallway before opening the hatch for you. They wish you good luck, and close up the hatch again immediately after you've left.`
	"CN-11169" `A line of Kimek, with some Saryds and Arachi in their midst, approach your ship shortly after you've finished landing. These must be the students. They are carrying very little luggage, and board your ship once you open the hatch. Given the young appearance of all of them, you struggle to guess which ones are the teachers. After the last of them comes in, you look outside for a while, confused. Only <bunks> came in, not the 35 that Elirom mentioned.`
	"CN-11170" `	"Weren't there 35 of you?"`
	"CN-11171" `	Many of them wince at the question, and some of the Kimek start making some rhythmless, low clicking sounds. One of the Saryds comes to close the hatch. "Mistaken, the one who contacted you, must have been," she says. "Here, all of us are."`
	"CN-11172" `	Many of them wince at the question, and some of the Kimek start making some rhythmless, low clicking sounds. One of the Saryds comes to close the hatch. "Not anymore..." she says.`
	"CN-11173" `	They tell you that they're ready to leave, and ask that you depart for <destination> as soon as possible.`
	"CN-11174" `Some of the local Kimek are waiting with transport vehicles for the students. They hand you <payment> once you step off your ship, and one of them appears to tick away at a list with each student that steps off your ship. After the last one leaves, he continues to look at your ship for a few seconds, then to the students, entering the vehicles. He strikes two lines, and thanks you for helping. Back inside your ship, you receive a call from Elirom.`
	"CN-11175" `	"<last>! Thank you for helping, I must," he says. "Difficult it can be, when relying on contractors we are. Prefer to travel in ships of my company, our clients usually do. Glad I am, that no issues with the 35 of them, you had. If any more trouble with our usual transports, I have, ask for your services again I may."`
	"CN-11176" `	"Sure thing, it's no problem helping with this."`
	"CN-11177" `	"There were only <bunks>, actually."`
	"CN-11178" `	"Only... oh, I..." he pauses for a few seconds just as his voice cracks a little. "Forgive me, Captain, mistaken, it appears I was. Mixed up the number of passengers with that of another client, I did. Pay more attention next time, I shall." He thanks you again, and ends the call.`
	"CN-11179" `	"<last>! A life saver, you are, quite literally," he says. "Handling other evacuations, I still am, so be there to thank you in person, I could not, but know that deeply grateful for your saving those 35, I am. Contact you again I will, when in need of more help rescuing members we are."`
	"CN-11180" `	"Of course, I'd be glad to help again."`
	"CN-11181" `	"There were only <bunks> waiting for me."`
	"CN-11182" `	Half a minute passes in silence. "I see. At any rate, thankful for your rescuing the others, I am," he says as he ends the call.`
	"CN-11183" `	"Appreciate your willingness to assist us, I do, Captain. Until we meet again." He thanks you once more and ends the call.`
	"CN-11184" `Walking around the spaceport for a few minutes, you're met by a pair of Saryds. "Captain <last>? Worked with our company before, you have. Helped with transporting a group of students, you had." You nod. "Another troubling situation, we have. Help us again, would you?" They point to a Kimek Spire, presumably the very same you boarded last time, parked at the edge of the local docks.`
	"CN-11185" `	"I'm not interested in that kind of job at the moment, sorry."`
	"CN-11186" `	"Certain of that, are you? Willing to pay very well for your continued service, the captain is. Change your mind, would <payment>?"`
	"CN-11187" `	"On second thought, I'd love a transport job right now."`
	"CN-11188" `	"I'm just not interested in working with you anymore, no."`
	"CN-11189" `	Once again you're brought to the Spire, but only the Saryds come in with you, unlike the Kimek from last time. You're all escorted through the corridors, and are all searched by the devices, before you're finally brought to Elirom. He greets you, thanking you for coming, "Some more problems, we've had, so in need of a contractor's help once more, the company is."`
	"CN-11190" `	"Contract us for transport to <planet>, some Arach ranchers did. Attempting to start a longcow business on the deserts of Shifting Sand, they are, and hoping for a loan from a prestigious bank on <planet>, to start off a new expansion to the ranch they were. <bunks> they are, in total, both ranchers and their employees. Only..." He pauses for a moment, as if considering something. "Difficult, the Arachi can be at times. Once discovered they had, that originally from a rival Arach House, the captain of their original transport was, refuse to return with him, they did. Given us until <date> to find a new transport, they have, before cancel out on us, they do."`
	"CN-11191" `	He says you'll receive <payment> once the ranchers are back on Shifting Sand, and urges you to hurry to <destination> before <date>, so that the Arachi don't cancel the transport. He wishes you good luck, and you're brought back out of the ship. The Saryds that went in with you stay inside, and the Spire departs not long after you've left.`
	"CN-11192" `	You follow them to the Spire, and they come in with you, unlike the Kimek from last time. You're all escorted through the corridors, and searched by the security devices, before you're finally brought to Elirom. "Hello Captain, good to see you it is," he greets you. "Word of more Heliarch fleet activity, I have received. Headed to <destination>, to aid on an ongoing search for our members, they are. Arrive there by <date>, they should, so in urgent need of a ship to rescue some <bunks> still on the planet, I am. Pay you <payment>, I will."`
	"CN-11193" `	"I'll go there right away."`
	"CN-11194" `	"How do you keep getting information about these fleets?"`
	"CN-11195" `	He collects his thoughts for a while before answering, "Work together to provide us secretive, quick data, Houses Bebliss and Idriss do. From them, the messages come. But, not by them, the information is found. Someone... something maybe, spying on the Heliarchs is. Not one of ours." He pauses again. "Doubted them myself, at first I had. But, never wrong, the information is, almost as if..." He trails off.`
	"CN-11196" `	"Attempting to pass as ranchers, the members are. On a trip to <planet>, but an argument with their original transport, they had. If stopped, you are, tell them that, you should. Remember, <date>. Hopefully still there when you arrive, all <bunks> of them are." He wishes you good luck, and you're brought out of the ship, with the Saryds that found you staying inside. Not long after you've left it, you see the Spire take off and leave the planet.`
	"CN-11197" `The ranchers arrive to the hangars shortly after you land, most of them Arachi, with a few Saryds and Kimek in their midst. They come into your ship, all <bunks> of them present.`
	"CN-11198" `	"All ready to leave, we are," one Arach tells you as most of the others head to find their bunks.`
	"CN-11199" `	"Got it, we'll leave soon."`
	"CN-11200" `	"How did getting that loan go?"`
	"CN-11201" `	"What?" She looks at you with puzzled eyes, until another Arach lightly whacks one of her legs. "Ah, yes, the loan. Well enough. Agreed to grant us the amount needed, they have." She looks back at the other Arach, who stares at her for a moment. "Well, very tired we all are, Captain, so head to my bunk, I will."`
	"CN-11202" `	"Thought I had, that left behind we would be," one Arach tells you after you've closed the hatch. "Hurry to <planet>, you should. Risk an 'inspection' by the Heliarchs, we cannot."`
	"CN-11203" `	"Is everyone here?"`
	"CN-11204" `	"Thankfully, yes. Lost nobody this time, we have," she says. "Less brutish on their searches on worlds like <origin>, the Heliarchs are. Managed to avoid them well enough, we did. Or, at least, hope so I do."`
	"CN-11205" `	"Well, I'm glad everyone's safe. We'll leave soon."`
	"CN-11206" `	"What do you mean? What's different about worlds like this one?"`
	"CN-11207" `	"What? Obvious is it not? In Saryd territory, we are. Come on now, ready to leave, we are."`
	"CN-11208" `	They all move to their bunks, and you set a course for <destination>.`
	"CN-11209" `The Arachi, along with the scattered few Saryds and Kimek, are ready to leave your ship right as you land, thanking you briefly as each one leaves. The Arachi who seemed to be leading the group give you more of a farewell, chatting a bit, until they see a Kimek Spire - that you all guess to be Elirom's ship - approaching. They grunt, and leave with the rest. You head into the Spire and meet Elirom, who hands you <payment> while watching the group leave in transports via one of the cameras on the outside of the ship.`
	"CN-11210" `	"They didn't seem very happy to see you."`
	"CN-11211" `	"How come you're here? I thought you hired me because you didn't have any ships available."`
	"CN-11212" `	"Hmm? Ah, well, return to where met you I had, one of the ships did. Make it in time to pick up the ranchers it could not, though, so very grateful for your service, the company is once again," he explains. "Delegate my own transport job to that ship instead, I did, for wish I did to apologize to the ranchers in person. Afraid I am, that hear my explanations they will not."`
	"CN-11213" `	"Seem to be the case, that does." He sighs. "Well, understandable it is, from their perspective. More careful about who I sent to transport them, I should have been."`
	"CN-11214" `	"How come you're here? I thought you reached out to me because you didn't have any ships available."`
	"CN-11215" `	"At the moment, I did not, and available in time to rescue them, none of my ships would be," he explains. "Come here after the first of my ships had returned, I did. Wished I had to apologize to them in person, though it seems that hear any of it, they will not..."`
	"CN-11216" `	"No, they were not." He sighs. "A Heliarch, I once was. Arbiter. High rank. Thought of as untrustworthy by many of the Redoubt, I still am. Think, some of them do, that responsible for tragedies that came to their families, I was." He continues watching the group dwindle as more transports come, until the last of them disappears into the spaceport village. "That they are wrong, I hope."`
	"CN-11217" `	He thanks you for helping out again, and says he'll be in contact if he needs any more of your help.`
	"CN-11218" `You receive a call seconds after you've touched down on <origin>. It's from Elirom, the Saryd who had you help transport some of his company's clients. "Captain <last>! Your help again, we need," he begins. "Hire us to bring them to their new home on Ablub's Invention, some immigrants from <destination> did. <bunks> in total. Only..." he looks down, his mouth struggling for words. "Fallen ill, the captain of the ship we had arranged for them has. Supposed to leave by <date>, they were, but get to <planet> in time, we cannot. You, however, a jump drive possess. Help us now, only you can, Captain."`
	"CN-11219" `	"I'd be glad to help. I'll head there as quick as I can."`
	"CN-11220" `	"Can't they just wait a bit longer for you to send another ship?"`
	"CN-11221" `	"I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now."`
	"CN-11222" `	"Please, Captain. Answer all your questions, I will, once safely here they are." He quickly types away at something close to the camera on his end, and you're notified of <payment> in total just having been transferred to your account. "Paid much more for bringing them to safety, you will be. To Ablub's Invention, bring them you must. Sending word for them to wait for you, I am. Help us this one last time, please do, <last>." He looks at you for a moment, then bows lightly before logging off.`
	"CN-11223" `	He sighs in relief, then quickly types away at something close to the camera on his end, and you're notified of <payment> in total just having been transferred to your account. "Paid much more you will be, once safe, the immigrants are. Bring them back to Ablub's Invention, you must. Send word for them to expect you, I shall." He bows lightly, then logs off.`
	"CN-11224" `You receive a call seconds after you've touched down on <origin>. It's from Elirom, and he wastes no time giving you your next mission. "A particularly urgent matter, this is. Looking for our members on <planet>, the Heliarchs are. Found, dozens have already been, and even more Heliarchs by <date> will there arrive. Make it in time, none of our ships can, too far away it is. Possess a jump drive, however, you do. Rescue the <bunks> remaining, you must." He types away at something on his end for a bit, and you see <payment> have been transferred to your account. "Much more I will give you, once safely back on Ablub's Invention you are. If stopped by the Heliarchs you are..." He trails off for a while, and you can hear the increasingly hurried, repeated tapping of hooves on the floor. "If stopped you are, tell them that transporting immigrants to their new homes on Ablub's Invention, you will. Hired by House Idriss, they have been." He urges you to go to <destination> immediately, wishing you good luck, and logging off.`
	"CN-11225" `You are contacted by Elirom upon landing.`
	"CN-11226" `	"Informed I was that manage to make it in time for the transport, you did not, Captain," he speaks in a much sterner tone than what you'd grown accustomed to. "Truly important for us, this job was. Helped us much, you have, but afraid I am that work together any longer, we will not. Goodbye."`
	"CN-11227" `	He signs off before you're able to explain your delay.`
	"CN-11228" `	"Why there were you not, <last>? Lost to the Heliarchs, all of them now are!" He punches the table, shaking the camera on his end. "Supposed to arrive on time, you were. To rescue them, you were meant to. Abandon them like that, how could you?" He appears to swear in the Saryd tongue.`
	"CN-11229" `	He spends a few minutes to calm down, then speaks up again. "Forgive me, Captain. Helped us much, you have, and appreciated your previous heroic actions are, but wrong to rely on you this time, I was."`
	"CN-11230" `	He signs off before you're able to inquire on other ways to save them.`
	"CN-11231" `The moment your ship touches down on the hangar you can already see a very large group of Saryds waiting. When you open your hatch, they rush in dozens at a time, and you catch some Kimek and Arachi in the middle, struggling to keep with the galloping mass. Once everyone is inside, you run a passenger count: only <bunks> of the 116 are on board. You look out, and see nobody else coming to your ship. One of the older Saryds approaches you, pressing the button to close the hatch. "Leave we must," he says. Looking back to the Saryd crowd, many of the adults are comforting their children. The sobs of one Saryd girl in particular drown out the others.`
	"CN-11232" `	"I was told there were 116 of you for me to pick up. We only have <bunks>."`
	"CN-11233" `	"Alright, we'll leave in a few minutes."`
	"CN-11234" `	He squints, clenching his hands into fists and then relaxing them again. "Only <bunks> you are getting. Take us away from here, now, or fly your ship myself, I will."`
	"CN-11235" `	"Understood. We'll leave in a few minutes."`
	"CN-11236" `	"What about the others?"`
	"CN-11237" `	He looks back to the wailing girl, his hands slightly trembling as he clenches them into fists. He turns back to you, opening his mouth as if to say something, but no words come out. He heads back to the crowd, headed for the young girl.`
	"CN-11238" `	You help everyone settle into their bunks, departing for <destination> when you're done.`
	"CN-11239" `You receive a message from Elirom as you enter the planet's airspace, passing you some coordinates and instructing you to land there instead of the usual ports here. You come to a complex in the middle of a prairie, with a blue-ish metal building at its center. As you come down for a landing, you see Elirom's own ship is landed there.`
	"CN-11240" `	Just as quickly as they entered it, your passengers rush out of your ship, greeting and hugging some of the people waiting for them. One of them, Elirom, shyly watches from the Spire, not having come down the ramp yet. The older Saryd who was accompanying the crying Saryd girl leaves her side briefly once he sees him, walking at a quick pace toward Elirom. He grabs him by the shoulders and shouts something in the Saryd language, though no translators pick it up. When he lets go of his shoulders, he goes back to accompanying the girl, and Elirom stays put. You go to him, which prompts him to reach in a pocket and grab a bunch of credit chips, handing them to you. <payment>, in total. "Tell you I did, that well paid you would be."`
	"CN-11241" `	"What were all of them so worked up about?"`
	"CN-11242" `	"What's really going on with you and your company?"`
	"CN-11243" `	He looks into your eyes for a few seconds, before taking a long gaze at the skies. "Come. Talk inside the ship, we should." You two head inside, and one of the Kimek crew members closes the hatch. You come to his bunk, where he sits down and begins, "A transport company, I do not own. No company at all, I own. Transporting students, ranchers, immigrants, you were not." He looks at you intensely. "Saving lives, what you have been doing is. Saving them," he points out to the corridor, in the direction of the hatch.`
	"CN-11244" `	"Saving them? From what?"`
	"CN-11245" `	"I just flew them from one planet to another."`
	"CN-11246" `	"And in doing so, saved their lives, you have," he responds. "The truth, it was, that arrive to the planets I sent you in time, my other ships would have not, but not in a hurry due to contracts, we were. Searching for them, the Heliarchs were, and on their way, Punisher fleets were. Captured, all those you rescued would have been, if arrived before you, those Punishers had."`
	"CN-11247" `	"Why, the Heliarchs. Our so-called 'protectors.' Paranoid, self-decorated butchers in their rooms deep within the rings..." He looks to the ground, disgust written on his face. "Preying on us for many centuries, they have been. With whatever insanities they invent and worship, their actions they justify."`
	"CN-11248" `	"The Heliarchs were looking for them? So they... you all are criminals?"`
	"CN-11249" `	"Elirom, I am. Born on Saros. Raised there, fascinated by the Heliarchs since my infancy. When of age I came, into the Academy of Cadets I enlisted. Served the Heliarchy for 67 years, I had, before finally the right thing, I did. For the last 18 of those years, an arbiter, I was." He brings his hands together, as if to warm them up. "The Lunarium Redoubt, I then joined. Belong to that group, they do, the people whom rescue, you did. Or, at least, their parents do... did." He sighs. "Criminals, outlaws... call us whatever names the Heliarchs do, simply trying to save our Coalition from them, we are. Saving people from their mock hunts for terrorists, my job is. Believe me, you may not. Choose to see us, you can, as what deem us, the Heliarchs do. In doing that, though, changing the things they do, the things that seen, I have, the things that..." he trails off. "But dead to them for decades now, I have been."`
	"CN-11250" `	"You want me to join your group in fighting the Heliarchs, is that it?"`
	"CN-11251" `	"Dead? What do you mean?"`
	"CN-11252" `	He thinks for a few minutes, oftentimes opening up his mouth as if deciding to speak, but ultimately going back to reflecting on what to say. "When decided to... desert, I had, work I did on covering up my escape of the facility where stationed, I was. After forcing an... an incident, meant to erase all traces of mine, fled and hid in civilian ships for a while, I had, until found by the Lunarium I was." He smirks lightly. "Thought I had that aware enough of their patterns and methods, I was, enough to locate them. Find me first, they did though. Taken in, I was, and helping them since, I have been."`
	"CN-11253" `	"What facility did you work at?"`
	"CN-11254" `	"An incident? What did you do?"`
	"CN-11255" `	His eyes flicker at your question, locked in with yours. He averts his gaze, looking back to the ground. "Get going, I really must. Address those you rescued, I shall. Attempt to comfort and relocate them."`
	"CN-11256" `	He gets up to leave. "Come ask for your help directly again, for a long time I may not, but still in need of help saving our members, we will be. Very grateful, we would be, if help us again when we need it, you would." He extends his arm, and shakes your hand, just before following you back out of the Spire. He quickly trots inside the central building, and you head to your ship and fly to the main spaceport.`
	"CN-11257" `	"He seemed angry at you."`
	"CN-11258" `	"I could only get <bunks>."`
	"CN-11259" `	"I know." He sighs. "Made sure I understood that, that old man has."`
	"CN-11260" `	"That he is. A difficult thing to go through, it is. Used to such rough talk, I've grown."`
	"CN-11261" `	He comes closer to you, slouching down and speaking quietly. "Come ask for your help directly again, for a long time I may not, but still in need of help saving our members, we always are. Very grateful, we would be, if help us again when we need it, you would." He pulls back, and extends his arm to shake your hand. He looks at the sky just before he leaves. "Steer clear from the sun you should, <last>." He thanks you again, and leaves to accompany the rescued members into the central building.`
	"CN-11262" `The spaceport of <origin> looks different than the usual Saryd ports: several large posters with some form of badge or logo are scattered about, some fallen to the ground, others still sticking to the walls. As you pick one up to get a better look, an Arach approaches you. "Captain <last> you are, yes?" You nod. "Tummug, I am called. Caught your eye, I see that our posters have. Part of a group promoting new cultural festivals and movies, I am. A tiresome task at times, repetitive even, but always worth it, in the end, helping spread word of new art pieces is."`
	"CN-11263" `	"What are these ones for?"`
	"CN-11264" `	"And you want my help, I take it?"`
	"CN-11265" `	You show him the poster you picked up, which has an image of two crescent moon figures 'swallowing' a dark, nine-pointed star. He looks at it for a while, then answers, "Ah, for the 'Twin Eclipse' theatrical show, it is. A recent success from a group of students from Starlit University. Forgive me, so many plays and films I help divulge, that forgetful of their exact imagery, I can get."`
	"CN-11266" `	He asks for the poster and as you hand it to him, he pulls out some manner of spray. Using it on the blank end of the poster and on the nearest wall, he puts it back there. "Done with my work here, I am. Transport to <planet> I need, as waiting for me to help spread some more posters, coworkers of mine are. Take me there, would you? Pay you <payment>, I will."`
	"CN-11267" `	"Sure, let me take you to my ship."`
	"CN-11268" `	"I'm not headed there right now, sorry."`
	"CN-11269" `	You give him the berth for your ship, and he tells you he'll meet you there soon before running off. A few minutes after you've reached the <ship>, you see him approaching, pushing a small crate "filled to the brim with the posters," he explains as you help him load it into your cargo. When you're done, you show him to his bunk, and prepare for the trip.`
	"CN-11270" `The spaceport of <origin> looks different than the usual Saryd ports: several large posters with some form of badge or logo are scattered about, some fallen to the ground, others still sticking to the walls. Picking one up to get a better look, you recognize the symbol to be that of the Lunarium Redoubt, two moons swallowing a dimming sun. "Up to any unlawful behavior, Captain <last>?" You turn to see an Arach standing there, looking at you. You recognize him as Tummug, one of the Lunarium leaders you met on Remote Blue. "Talk in your ship, could we?" You bring him to the <ship>, and seal the hatch. "Spreading propaganda material against the Heliarchy, I am. The purpose of those posters you found, that is," he explains. "Not the best recruitment strategy, but what I can do without risking too many of our members, it is. Available, are you? In need of transport to <planet>, to continue the work, I am."`
	"CN-11271" `	"Of course, we'll leave right away."`
	"CN-11272" `	"Sorry, I'm not going that way right now."`
	"CN-11273" `	"First, get the merchandise, I must," he says as he leaves your ship. He comes back a few minutes later, pushing a small crate "filled to the brim with the posters," he explains as you help him load it into your cargo. When you're done, you show him to his bunk, and prepare for the mission.`
	"CN-11274" `As you're still handling landing procedures, Tummug is organizing the posters in several smaller piles. "Make sure everyone has the same amount of posters, I must. Let any of them slack off, I will not," he banters. Your ship touches down on the hangar, and Tummug hands you <payment>. He makes a call, and minute after minute some Saryds start coming to your ship. You open the hatch, and he starts handing out a pile of posters to each one who comes in. The posters aren't all identical, though the imagery is pretty much the same in all of them: a dark, nine-pointed star, crumbling to pieces.`
	"CN-11275" `	"So what are these posters for?"`
	"CN-11276" `	"Do you really need that many posters?"`
	"CN-11277" `	He pauses at your question. "What they are for? Oh, the... 'Crumbling Winter Star' I believe it is called? The play these posters are for?" he asks to one of the Saryds, extending his legs to give them their pile of posters. The Saryd looks at him, then you, and nods. "A big hit on Saros, I hear it was."`
	"CN-11278" `	"How exactly are these images going to help?"`
	"CN-11279" `	"A symbol of Heliarch power, their shining golden sun is. A taboo, dimming or breaking that sun has become. Punishable, even. So, with dimming and breaking that sun, hoping we are that get the Saryds interested in finding out why one would do that, the posters do," he explains.`
	"CN-11280" `	"One of the more populous Saryd planets, this is," he responds. "Sure, on the smaller side, the city may be, by Arach or Kimek standards, but still large enough to warrant many posters, it is."`
	"CN-11281" `	He hands out one of the final two piles to the last Saryd, and grabs the last one for himself. "Now, help them with the posters, I will. If interested in helping us further, meet you in the spaceport, I will. Have some dozen extra bunks available, you must make sure," he says as he leaves your ship.`
	"CN-11282" `As before, you find the local spaceport decorated with Tummug's various posters, with some all over the walls and a few on the floor already. Either they were taken down or simply failed to stick to the wall properly. Most of the locals just glance at them, then continue on with their business; only a few pockets of people have formed near some of the posters, perhaps discussing the imagery. Some of the spaceport cleaning workers, on the other hand, take them down nonchalantly, though they don't seem to care too much about getting all the posters.`
	"CN-11283" `	You find Tummug waiting for you in a cafe with some Saryds. "Ready to help us again are you, Captain?" he asks as you sit down.`
	"CN-11284" `	"Where are we going now?"`
	"CN-11285" `	"Is everyone here? I made sure to have some bunks free as you said."`
	"CN-11286" `	"Ah, thank you Captain. Yes, all <bunks> of us, this time you will be transporting," he answers. "Bring along some more help, I wished to, but canceled some of the others have. Some more work here, they must do."`
	"CN-11287" `	He runs one leg over his mandibles in an almost contemplative gesture. "To my home, we will go. <destination>. Setting up one of the famous Arachi soirees, some of the locals are, and tasked with helping them gather attention, we were. Paid <payment> once on <planet> we are, you will be."`
	"CN-11288" `	You all leave the cafe, and Tummug and the ten others follow you to your ship. They bring in <cargo>, and settle in their bunks.`
	"CN-11289" `	You find Tummug waiting for you in a cafe with some Saryds. He gets up once he sees you, and the Saryds follow him outside the establishment. "Talk in your ship, we should," he says once he's close. You all head to the hangars and get inside your ship, with some of the Saryds heading elsewhere to pick up the cargo you'll be carrying. "Run into some trouble, a few of ours have. Leaving for <planet>, we are. Born and raised there, I was, so more familiar with the city's layout, I am. Less likely for some of us to be caught, it should be. Provide them a place to lay low for some time, we will."`
	"CN-11290" `	"Shouldn't we help the ones who got caught?"`
	"CN-11291" `	"Alright, we'll leave once the others come back."`
	"CN-11292" `	"Caught? Caught they were not," he says. "Run into some trouble, they have, but caught, they have not yet been. Not that I've heard, at least." He pauses as he looks out to the hangars. "Made it to the meeting point, they have not, but news of any arrests or executions, I have not seen. Most likely, hiding out to avoid the patrols that could have seen them, they are."`
	"CN-11293" `	The Saryds return a few minutes later with <cargo>. Once it's safely in your cargo hold, you show Tummug and the others to their bunks.`
	"CN-11294" `As before, Tummug separates the banners into small piles as you're finishing your landing procedures. He hands you <payment> right before the first few Saryds leave with their piles, and a few local Arachi join them in picking up banners to distribute around their local neighborhoods. "Meet you in the spaceport again, we will," Tummug says as he finishes distributing the banners. Looking at his own pile, you see an image split with a sharp line running from top to bottom, with the drawing of an Arach collapsing under a scorching sun on the left side contrasted with one having a happy dinner under the moonlight on the right side. Some message in the Arach language is written out at the bottom, below the two images.`
	"CN-11295" `	"What does that say?"`
	"CN-11296" `	"Alright, I'll meet you at the spaceport in a few hours."`
	"CN-11297" `	"This? 'The Twins' Twin Ships' it is, a... mostly comedic play," he explains. "Nearly identical in looks, the two Arach main characters are, but a rich member of a great House, one of them is, while simply cheap transport to a world with a better job, the other wants. On the same planet, unaware of one another, book passage with the two different Kimek captains, they do. Only, also alike, the two Kimek are, and fly the same model of ship, the Kimek Thistle, they do. Brought to a scorching, stale Saryd factory world, the rich Arach is, while a fancy welcome by the powerful House, the worker gets." He catches himself before going further into the plot. "Well, uh, like I said, mostly a comedy, it is. Not too interesting, I suppose it might be."`
	"CN-11298" `	"Read 'Down with the Tyrant House!' it does." He says. Once he notices you have no idea what that means, he continues, "An Arach nickname for the Heliarchy, it is. First used thousands of years ago it was, when more restrictive, and much less lenient, the Heliarchs were becoming. Prohibited, the expression was, but still known, its meaning is."`
	"CN-11299" `	He prepares to leave, and tells you to free up some ten tons of cargo space and keep five bunks available before meeting with him in the spaceport. He then heads down the hatch and disappears into the city.`
	"CN-11300" `The spaceport on <origin> shows fewer of the banners than you expected, with only a few scattered about the walls. One Arach leaves their work building and gasps at the first banner they see, taking it down and throwing it in a bin. They seem stunned for a second, and look around in a hurry, right before scurrying off. Another Arach has a similar reaction to a different banner, but after pondering for a bit, leaves it alone and walks away.`
	"CN-11301" `	When you're done gauging the local reception to Tummug's banners, you go look for him. Eventually you arrive at a workshop, where he's talking with four other Arachi as they work on some small robots not too different from those employed in Arach hull repair systems. The only difference appears to be "wings" that the Arachi are testing by controlling them remotely. "Captain <last>!" Tummug exclaims when he notices you. "Apologize, I must, for not waiting for you in the spaceport. Caught up in testing the prototypes, we were."`
	"CN-11302" `	"What were you testing?"`
	"CN-11303" `	"What are those robots for?"`
	"CN-11304" `	"Remote-controlled drones, they are." He asks one of the Arachi for their controller and begins flying the robot around you. "Testing the precision and response time of commands given to them, we were. Essential for our next venture, they are." He moves the robot away from you and pushes a button on the controller, prompting several small compartments around the machine to open up and a reddish smoke to seep out. "Going to <destination> next, we are. A very populous world, it is, so impossible to cover the whole city in posters, it would be. Use these robots for skywriting our messages, we will." He hands the controller back to the Arach and walks up to you, showing a flyer small enough to fit in your palm, with some short messages in the Kimek language. "Useful for dropping these over the main city, they also will be."`
	"CN-11305" `	"Well, I hope the robots work okay. I'll help you bring them to my ship."`
	"CN-11306" `	"What's written there?"`
	"CN-11307" `	He pulls back the flyer, looking closely at it. "It should be... 'Hottest Summer' and 'an attraction for all people.' A Kimek movie, it is. Not too used to reading Kimek, I am, but designed by some of our Kimek coworkers, these were, so no issues here, there should be." He looks back at the robots. "Only keep the skywriting correct as well, we need."`
	"CN-11308" `	He signals to one of the Arachi, and they walk past you to close the doors and windows to the workshop. "Headed for <destination> next, we are. Too populous a world it is, for us to cover all ground with posters or banners. Use the robots, we will." He asks one of the Arachi for their controller and brings the robot closer to you. He presses a button, and it prompts several compartments around the drone to open up, releasing a reddish smoke. "Leave our messages in skywriting, we will," he says as he hands the controller back to the Arachi. He approaches you, showing you a flyer small enough to fit in your palm, with some short messages in the Kimek language. "Use them to drop these around the main spaceport city, we also will."`
	"CN-11309" `	"Isn't that too risky? Wouldn't the Heliarchs find you out with ease?"`
	"CN-11310" `	"This one means 'Lordless Suns,' and 'Our Laws for Our People' on this other one," he says, pointing with the tip of one leg to one boldened symbol as he says the first "our." He goes to explain their meaning. "The lords of all Coalition stars, the Heliarchs call themselves. When taken, the Ring of Friendship was, when formed, the Heliarchy was, still far more advanced and experienced in most fields the Saryds were. Turned 'their' ring into the seat of government, they had, and in the naive euphoria victory had granted them, tricked into adopting the Saryd law system, the Kimek and Arachi of the time were. Saryd sentences, Saryd punishments." He looks at you as he drags some legs across the floor, as if scratching the ground. "For only a quarter of a Saryd lifetime, the eldest of the Arachi lived. For all their population, managed to live past a century only a few dozen Kimek have. A third of a lifetime to them, even relatively minor Saryd sentences, the Heliarch sentences, are." He slowly crumples the flyer. "Ruled by laws of long-dead Saryd lords, we still are..."`
	"CN-11311" `	"Spoken with Elirom, I have. Moving fleets around, the Heliarchs are, since distractions for them in other systems, some of our teams have prepared," he explains. "Fewer ships on the planet there are, and quick about it, we will be, so unlikely for them to find us, it is."`
	"CN-11312" `	Tummug tells the other Arachi to pack up the rest of the robots and flyers, and accompanies you to your ship. In a few minutes the Arachi come dragging carts with crates filled with the drones, flyers, and canisters of the red smoke for the skywriting. The Saryds you brought here follow after them, bringing along more and more carts. Tummug says you'll get <payment> once they get to <planet>, and moves to his bunk, with the other Arachi following suit.`
	"CN-11313" `This time Tummug doesn't go on to split the flyers into various piles as you're landing. "Already arranged them in the boxes, we have," he says. He directs you to land in a lone hangar on one of the factories far from the city. Upon landing, several Kimek enter the hangar and start crating off the flyers and skywriting drones back to the factory, presumably to make sure they're all in working order. Tummug hands you <payment>, thanking you for bringing them here.`
	"CN-11314" `	"Now Captain, fly the drones over the city we will. Only here to keep an eye on any issues they might have, and repair them, we are," he explains. "To better enjoy the show, head back to the main hangars closer to the city, you should. Once finished, we are, meet you in the spaceport I will. Some more cargo space and bunks, we'll need." You head to your ship, and fly it back to the city.`
	"CN-11315" `	"Now <last>, safe here we should be, but even with fewer Heliarch ships now, stay docked here you should not. If traced to here, the signal controlling the drones is, ready to abandon the facility and flee, everyone is," he explains. "Meet you in the spaceport later, I will. Some more cargo space and bunks, we'll need." You head to your ship, and fly it back to the city.`
	"CN-11316" `	Almost half an hour goes by with you watching the skies of <planet> before the first signs of the drones show: they're too small for you to see from where you are, but you make out the piles of red smoke swiftly growing into Kimek letters in the sky, appearing in spiraling columns and arcs, with small, spread out dots separating the letters. Crowds clog the streets, Kimek look out the windows and some even gather atop apartment buildings to gaze at the messages. When the drones are done, the messages Tummug had shown you on the flyer are fully formed, and the drones take a short break. When they return, they get to work on another set of messages as the first one begins dissipating. After a few repetitions, and another pause, flyers begin raining down the city streets, the local Kimek picking them up in curiosity and discussing among themselves. The "rain" goes on for several minutes, before the drones start heading to other portions of the city and you lose sight of them.`
	"CN-11317" `	Focusing now on the crowds and their reception, you see the Kimek are split: nearly everywhere they are in heated discussion, with many on one side seemingly approving of the display, while others yell and gesture for the messages to be put out, throwing the flyers to the ground and stomping on them. The Heliarch agents present on the ground do their best to separate the crowds and keep the order, but struggle against the sheer number of Kimek. Not long after the drones disappeared, however, Heliarch warships fly through the atmosphere in a fury, speedily undoing the skywriting as they head in the direction of the factory. Some ships leave more agents on the ground, and with increased personnel the Heliarchs now manage to stop the crowd infighting, and start clearing out the streets.`
	"CN-11318" `Tummug is quick to find you in the spaceport. He approaches you with the Arachi who helped him with the drones, as well as some Saryds and Kimek, all following behind him in a dash. "Delay you long this time I will not, Captain <last>," he says. "Headed to <destination> we are. Already arranged for what we'll need to be brought to your ship, I have."`
	"CN-11319" `	He then tugs on your clothing as if asking you to bow down a bit, as he himself stretches up. "Leave at once, we must!" he whispers.`
	"CN-11320" `	You do your best to keep up as you run with them back to your ship, where they help some others load boxes and crates of promotional posters into your cargo hold. Strangely enough, you don't see any of the flyers that the drones rained from above earlier, or any sort of video displaying the skywriting on screens around the spaceport. Once the cargo is all in your ship, Tummug comes to say you'll receive <payment> for the job, and rushes inside your ship with the others.`
	"CN-11321" `	He briefly glances around, then says, "A busy day it is, so hurry back to your ship we should. Otherwise, difficult to find, available cargo loaders will be."`
	"CN-11322" `	Running back to your ship, you notice a total lack of the flyers that rained down the city earlier, or any replay of the skywriting on any of the screens around the spaceport. Tummug and the Arachi who worked on the drones are all with the group, but their rush to get to your ship leaves you uneasy. You all help some more members get boxes and crates of posters into your ship, and head inside with Tummug and the others once you're done. "Leave now, we must. Too much attention, the drone show seems to have gained us," he tells you. "Pay you <payment> once on <planet> we are, I will. Go." They all head to their bunks, and you move to the cockpit, firing up your engines.`
	"CN-11323" `Tummug gives you the <payment> and starts working on opening up the crates and boxes with the others. By the time you open the hatch, they've only managed to open some of the crates, but it seems like they've called in several Saryds from the hangar to help unload the remaining boxes and move them elsewhere. You approach Tummug, who's still picking through the posters. The posters are emblazoned with images of Saryds, Kimek and Arachi jailed and imprisoned in cages made out of chains. Looking closely, you realize the "chains" are made out of circlets like those used by the Heliarchs. Your eyes go to Tummug, who's looking back at you.`
	"CN-11324" `	"What exactly are these for?"`
	"CN-11325" `	"I don't think the Heliarchs would be very approving of these."`
	"CN-11326" `	"Approving of none of our work, they are," he responds. "Enjoy lying to you, I did not, Captain, but risky it would be, to tell you who we were before we secured the boxes and crates from <origin>."`
	"CN-11327" `	"True it is, that spreading around posters, banners and flyers as propaganda, we have. Only, not for some movie or other media they were. Jabs at the Heliarchy, they all have been, means of getting the people thinking, so that maybe recruit them, we can. Help greatly with that, what we secured from <origin> will."`
	"CN-11328" `	"What did you bring in those crates? Weapons?"`
	"CN-11329" `	"Evidence. Proof. Of their crimes unpunished, of treason against one's own. Hold countless billions, the Kimek factory worlds do, and grounds for many of the Heliarchs' senseless arrests, they are. Write off disappearances as work accidents they do, but records, they keep, and tracking the captured 'criminals' they always are. Our target, those records were. There described, the whereabouts or fates of many are."`
	"CN-11330" `	He remains quiet for a while, focusing his eyes on the images, then on yours as he hands you one of the posters. "Called the Lunarium Redoubt, my group is. Nickname us rebels and outlaws, the Heliarchs kindly do in their broadcasts. Helped us you have, <last>, and help us a lot more, in other ways you can." He pauses, still locking eyes with you. "Think not the Heliarchs as benefactors. Ruin us they will, if stop them we cannot."`
	"CN-11331" `	"Self explanatory, I imagine?" he says before he picks up the last few of them from the box. "Spread these around the planets, we of course will, but more valuable, the information in the unopened boxes and crates is."`
	"CN-11332" `	"What information?"`
	"CN-11333" `	"Is that why you were in such a rush to leave before?"`
	"CN-11334" `	"Hoped we had, that suffice as a distraction the skywriting and rain of flyers would, so that safe for the others to break in and steal the data it was," he explains, sighing. "Mistaken, we were. Set their patrols off all around, our previous propaganda efforts apparently did. Go into hiding for a while, they'll need to."`
	"CN-11335" `	"Documents, recorded data of the fates or whereabouts of many who 'disappeared,' we stole. A common thing it is, on Kimek factory worlds, for Heliarchs to write them off as work accidents. Investigate the data thoroughly we will, and maybe uncover the coordinates of their prison - or morgue - we finally can."`
	"CN-11336" `	He thanks you for helping, and leaves your ship with the remaining posters. You go to check the spaceport and portions of the city later, but find neither Tummug, his colleagues, or any of the posters.`
	"CN-11337" `After wandering the spaceport for a while, you notice a crowd of dozens of individuals heading to the hangars, specifically in what looks like the direction of your ship. A roughly equal number of Kimek and Arachi, with some Saryds as well, they stand in front of the <ship>, looking around as if searching for its captain. You approach them, and one of the Kimek, whose thorax and abdomen are slimmer than the usual for her species, meets you to speak for their group.`
	"CN-11338" `	"There you are, Captain <last>," she greets you. "Pyakri, my name is, and looking for your transport services, my friends and I are. Talk in your ship, could we? Wish to discuss the details there, I do."`
	"CN-11339" `	"Sure, let me get the hatch."`
	"CN-11340" `	"You'll have to clear out, I'm not taking any passengers now."`
	"CN-11341" `	You bring her aboard, and she continues when you close the hatch. "Thank you Captain. Now, assisted some of my colleagues, you already have, yes?" She waits for you to answer, but seeing your puzzled look, resumes her explanation. "The Lunarium Redoubt? Assisted us before, you have, even if aware of all the details beforehand you were not. Suppose I do that mostly heard of us as criminals or the like, you must have. Petty in their propaganda, the Heliarchs are. Recommend you as trustworthy, some people did whom helped you have, so possible it is, to go ahead with a special endeavor that planning, I have been."`
	"CN-11342" `	"What's this 'endeavor' you need help with?"`
	"CN-11343" `	"Your friends only told me what I was really doing after I was done. I don't want to help you any further."`
	"CN-11344" `	"Why? Interested in helping the Heliarchs instead, are you? Worked with them, some of our members have. An arbiter, Elirom, one of them, was. One of the highest ranks, that is, second only to the consuls themselves," she responds, getting closer to you. "Change for the better, the Coalition soon will. Difficult it will be, to take down the Heliarchy. Very strong it is, so greatly appreciated any help would be. Of course, once free from them we are, rewarded appropriately shall be those, help us who do in our time of need."`
	"CN-11345" `	"And what would I have to do to help you?"`
	"CN-11346" `	"Why do you want to take down the Heliarchs? Seems to me the Coalition is doing very well under them."`
	"CN-11347" `	"Whether you and your friends win or lose, I want no part in it. I'm not helping you."`
	"CN-11348" `	"Of course, only exposed to Heliarchy propaganda, you are. An achievement of the current Heliarchs, what prosperity we have is not, and furthering that prosperity, they most certainly are not!" She quickly slows down her breathing after the exclamation, calming down. "Grown paranoid, they have. Seen a Quarg in millennia, nobody in the Coalition has, but think they do, that to fight the Quarg their purpose is. Making enemies, taking prisoners of their own people, they have been. Public arrests with no warning or cause, disappearances in the night..." She backs away slightly, her mandibles clicking in a low murmur. "Leave I will, if interested you are not, but in need of help we are, Captain."`
	"CN-11349" `	"Help with what, exactly?"`
	"CN-11350" `	"I'm sorry, but helping your group any further sounds too risky to me."`
	"CN-11351" `	"Difficult it is, to fight Heliarch ships, but fight them all the same we will need to, eventually," she explains. "Not very... experienced in warfare, most of our members are, as avoiding any ship battles we have been. Seeing as a jump drive you have, think we did that bring some of our regional fleet leaders to human space, you could. Train there against human pirates, we can."`
	"CN-11352" `	"Alright. I'll help you. How many people are you bringing along?"`
	"CN-11353" `	She perks up with your answer. "<bunks> in total, our group is. Wish to cause a commotion in human space, we do not, so bringing along <cargo> to sustain ourselves for a while, we are. Avoid leaving the ships at all, we will."`
	"CN-11354" `	You recognize her as Pyakri, a Lunarium military leader who you met on Remote Blue, and bring her aboard your ship to talk. "Looking for you I have been, Captain <last>. Need your help I do, for a training endeavor of sorts."`
	"CN-11355" `	"What do you need help with?"`
	"CN-11356" `	"I'm not very good at training others, are you sure you need my help?"`
	"CN-11357" `	Her mandibles click together rapidly, sounding almost like a chime in its rhythm. "Doing the training you will not be. For the most part, at least," she explains. "Waiting just outside, many of our regional fleet leaders are. Your jump drive, and some of your knowledge, what we need is." She chirps again.`
	"CN-11358" `	"Very... lacking, most of our members are, in ship to ship combat expertise. Wish to test some tactics, the leaders do, so that better explain it to members under them they can. Of course, dangerous to challenge the Heliarchs for that, it is, so thought of training against human pirates, we did. Bring us to human space for that, you would. <bunks> in total we are, and bring along <cargo> to sustain ourselves without needing to leave the ships and cause a commotion, we will."`
	"CN-11359" `	She asks you to open the hatch, and she has a few more members from the crowd come in. They ask for your map, and then for the nearest hub of pirate activity. You point to Greenrock in Shaula, the biggest pirate world in southern human space, telling them it's one of the most dangerous ones. They then ask if there are any major shipyards in the South, and you point them to Southbound Shipyards, on <planet>, and the Tarazed Corporation, on Wayfarer. After some debate, they decide that <planet>'s proximity to the Coalition makes it a better pick in case they need to return quickly, and settle on that as the destination. "Bringing along enough credits to purchase a few warships, I hope we are," Pyakri comments. They have their <cargo> brought to your ship, and you show them to their bunks.`
	"CN-11360" `Once you've landed, Pyakri and some other Lunarium members come to your cockpit, where you show them a monitor with the list of ships for sale at the local shipyard. You answer their questions about the ships' abilities, strengths, and failings to the best of your knowledge. You also show them the outfits available on <origin>, in case they want to change any of the ship loadouts. After discussing with the others for a few minutes, and going back to check the pages of some ships, Pyakri asks you to help her purchase 1 Bastion, 3 Argosies and 4 Clippers.`
	"CN-11361" `	"Are you sure you don't want more Bastions? They're pretty tough, you'd all be safer in them."`
	"CN-11362" `	"So how are you going to actually enter the ships? I thought you wanted to remain secret from humans."`
	"CN-11363" `	"Much more durable than what we have available, Heliarch ships are. Aware of the danger, everyone is, and to better understand ways to survive in more fragile ships, practice with them we must."`
	"CN-11364" `	"Be outside for long, we cannot, so to have the ships brought closer to here, we will need. Wait for nightfall first, though, we should, as easier to sneak quickly into the purchased ships it would be."`
	"CN-11365" `	You help her finish the transaction, giving the basic rundown of Southbound's shipyard interface, and ask for the ships to be brought to the hangars beside the <ship>. "A great help you were, Captain. Vital, this will be, if to pass as a human fleet, we are. Be careful in communicating with clients in the area, I must be." Your face showing some confusion, she explains her plans further. "After gotten the gist of fighting human pirates with you, we have, work as bounty hunters, we will. Make enough to pay you back for your services, I intend to. Even if similar to taking jobs in the Coalition space, human bounties are, need to communicate minimally with the clients, we may still."`
	"CN-11366" `	"Well, I'm sure you'll get the hang of it."`
	"CN-11367" `	"Are you sure that's a good idea? Since you want to avoid humans noticing you."`
	"CN-11368" `	"What? Oh, worried about the translators, are you? Yes, sound robotic at times, they can, but impede us not, that will. Readied the translating software to work on text messages, we have. Neither seen nor heard, we will be," she touts.`
	"CN-11369" `	"I'm more worried that the... speech pattern will give you away."`
	"CN-11370" `	"Well, if you think you'll be alright, sure."`
	"CN-11371" `	"Pattern?" She looks at you, confused, and so you explain the quirk of the Coalition's translator boxes. You ask her to simply type something into your monitor, with the aid of the same translating software, and point to her the jumbled words when it translates to your language. "And always like this, our translators have been?" she asks in disbelief. You nod, and in either some act of shame, or anger, she cowers her legs closer to her body, while tapping the ground with them erratically. "Work perfectly for translating from the human language, they do, and problems between the Coalition languages, there are not... Reported before, this issue was not. Not to the Heliarchs, not to us! An embarrassment, that is..." She sighs, spreading her legs back to normal. "Once in power, we are, talk to Oobat about fixing them, I will. For now, hope I will that need to communicate with humans much, we will not."`
	"CN-11372" `	Once all the purchased ships are parked near your own, you give her another rundown, this time of the job board. You help her learn the layout of bounty hunting jobs, and give her some tips on locating ships with bounties on them. Hours after nightfall, you see the hangars become much less lively, with only the night shift workers moving about. You open the hatch and make sure the coast is clear before moving with the Lunarium members to the Bastion, parked closest to your own ship. The members assigned to that ship enter the hatch, Pyakri included, and you repeat the process with the others, heading to the Argosies in front of you. After the last of them, you move in quick trips to each of the Clippers, finally looping back to your ship once you're done. With everyone now in their own ship, you ask some workers to help move the supplies right by the hatches. Once the workers have moved away, the Lunarium crew open up to bring the cargo inside, and you head to the Bastion to meet with Pyakri.`
	"CN-11373" `	You find the ship's interior already undergoing modifications, with many of the Arachi using various legs to hold wires in place as they replace the human control pads and keys to versions they are more accustomed to. Pyakri is inside the cockpit, testing many of the controls as she looks at a manual on one screen, already translated to the Kimek language. "Ah, hello again Captain. Worked well, the plan has, and seen we were not. At least hope that, I do." She opens up a map, pointing to a star you recognize as <waypoints>. "Taken our first job, we have. Since far more experienced in fighting human pirates, you are, ask for your help in this first fight, I must. Informed me the job offer has, that in this system the bounties are. Head there quickly to face them, we should, before time to flee, they have. Follow your ship there, we will." You go from ship to ship, reminding each of the captains to be careful in the coming fight, and then enter your own. With the purpose of this training being to grow the Lunarium's combat experience and tactics, things certainly wouldn't work well if some of them died right in their first fight, so you should try and keep them all alive.`
	"CN-11374" `Pyakri contacts you right as you land, by a text message in your monitor. "A great help you were, Captain! More... battle-hardened, if call them that you could, the crew with me are, so have much trouble with their morale, I did not, but still have me worried, the pirates did. Used to human ships, we are not, so fly them well enough to combat such fleets, we cannot. Not yet. Now that guided us through this first fight, you have, work on our own for a while - taking smaller, simpler bounties - we will. Contact you again, I shall, once done with our training, we are."`
	"CN-11375" `Your monitor shifts into a messaging interface as you're landing, and some text quickly pours in. "Captain, hello. Pyakri, it is. In the last few months, fought many human pirates, and managed to practice and hone fleet movements, we have. Return to the others in the Coalition, we now must, so need your help again, we will. Waiting on <planet>, we will be." The message ends and your monitor returns to normal. You set a marker on <destination> to head there later and pick up the Lunarium members.`
	"CN-11376" `Pyakri's fleet lands on the pads around the <ship>, and they message you saying they will wait for nightfall to board your ship. In the meantime, they focus on removing objects and tools and undoing adaptations to the ships that could give away their presence. Once the sun sets you notice them opening their hatches, so you open your own and help them quickly and quietly sneak into your ship. Perhaps because they'd grown used to human space, or maybe they simply did not care since they were going home for good, they proved a lot less cautious this time around, though you still don't imagine anyone saw them.`
	"CN-11377" `	Once everyone is in your ship, Pyakri approaches you and hands you some credit chips worth <payment> in total. "Try splitting the fleet into smaller ones for a while, we did, so taken some simpler, less rewarding bounties, we also have," she explains. "But, hopefully made enough to pay you for your services, we have."`
	"CN-11378" `	"Did you manage to fight the pirates well enough?"`
	"CN-11379" `	"Honestly I'm surprised you didn't lose anyone. Some of the ships you bought aren't exactly made for fighting."`
	"CN-11380" `	She clicks her mandibles quickly. "Neither are ours. Coalition ships, I mean. Of weaker materials, our civilian vessels are made, with less intricate shield matrices, less space for weaponry. With that knowledge, intentionally choose ships on the more fragile side for this training, I did. Focused on fighting heavier human ships, we were, to simulate that difference in durability and firepower," she explains. "Of course, with Heliarch ships, much greater the gap is, but a useful experience it has been regardless."`
	"CN-11381" `	"Lie I will not, difficult the first few months were. Very used to the Coalition, to our equipment, we were, so forget we did many times that no hull repair capabilities of their own, the ships had." She passes her two front legs over her head a few times, as if brushing it in shame. "Lucky we were, that no casualties we had. At least, a good way to improvise mid-battle rescues, it all was." she finishes, perking up her head.`
	"CN-11382" `	You once again help them contact the local shipyard and arrange for the selling of their fleet. After the process is done and the workers have finished taking away the ships, Pyakri tells you that they're ready to head back to the Coalition, to <destination>, from where they'll head back to their respective bases and share their newfound experience with Lunarium recruits. You help Pyakri and the rest to their bunks, and set a course for <planet>.`
	"CN-11383" `Shortly after you land, several groups come to meet some of the Lunarium members and escort them to their ships. They depart right away, while any remaining members leave straight for the city. "Gotten word of our return yet, the others have not, so wait here for more ships to bring them to the planet they normally operate from, they will," Pyakri explains.`
	"CN-11384" `	"A great help you were, Captain. Train normally against each other as in drills, we cannot, as risk the Heliarchs finding us, it would. Not very useful either, since fighting ships weak like our own, we will not be." She looks out to the others, preparing to head into the city herself. "Aware I am that joined up with us, you have not, Captain. Your choice, it is, whether help us further you do, help the Heliarchs, or just leave and never return. Just, ask you I do, that think well about it before deciding, you must." With that, she says goodbye, and follows the others into the city.`
	"CN-11385" `	"Lucky we are that joined us, you have, Captain <last>. Wanted for years to try some tactics in real combat, I had, but of course, do it here without risking our whole operation, we could not. Hope I do that boost the confidence of our lower ranks, the recent experience we gained will." She asks you to be careful in your travels, and says goodbye, following the others into the city.`
	"CN-11386" `As you prepare to land on <origin>, your monitor starts producing a low hum, stops, then starts again. This keeps up for nearly a minute until a message pops up. "Captain <last>, come to trust you our comrades have, thanks to your consistent help to our cause. Interested we are in your continuous support, so that free the Coalition, together we can. Come to <destination> you must. Meet with you, our leaders will, so that discuss an important task with them, you may. Have an available bunk in your ship, you should."`
	"CN-11387" `	The message cuts off shortly after you finish reading it. Your monitor is back to normal, and no humming sound can be heard. You mark <planet> on your map.`
	"CN-11388" `Here on <origin>, the Lunarium leaders are waiting for you. Would you like to meet with them and officially join the Lunarium? Given their cause against the Heliarchs, this would no doubt set you on a path to conflict with the Heliarchy.`
	"CN-11389" `	(No. I don't want to support the Lunarium at all.)`
	"CN-11390" `	You leave your ship to find a pair of Kimek waiting for you. "Follow us to the meeting point, you will," one of them says, and you oblige, trying to keep a low profile as you go with them across the city. You reach a district near the center of town, with modest blocks and few skyscrapers, and head into what seems to be a Kimek restaurant. You continue following the two Kimek past busy tables and Kimek patrons who all have eyes on you as you head to the back.`
	"CN-11391" `	Taking an elevator, you move down a few levels. You arrive at some doors that open to an Arach delegation, with half a dozen bulky Arachi surrounding a young, fine-dressed lady in a blue "dress" with white lines wrapping around it. "Oh, finally arrived, have they?" she says as you step off the elevator, coming to meet you. "<first> <last>, is it? So intrigued by our most recent recruit, I was, that decide I did to come to this meeting for once. Lady Lobmab Bebliss, I am, head of our great house, and benefactor to the Lunarium." She steps one leg forward towards you, as if in some archaic Arach gesture. Unsure on how to respond, you do your best extravagant bow, which seems to satisfy her as she pulls her leg back closer to her body. "Confess I must, however, that most inconvenient it is, to come so far away while maintaining a low profile. Difficult to just disappear, it is, when the head of the greatest Arach House, you are. Hope I do that worth it, your contributions are."`
	"CN-11392" `	"I'll do what I can to help."`
	"CN-11393" `	"It sounds like you've contributed much to the Lunarium cause. How have you helped the resistance?"`
	"CN-11394" `	"Yes, well observed. Kept the Lunarium Redoubt safe from prying Heliarch eyes and ears, my house has. Under me, assured it is that found by them, no dealings of ours - no dealings involving you - are," she says in a smug tone.`
	"CN-11395" `	The Kimek who accompanied you here ask that you continue on. Lobmab and her bodyguards lead the way through busy cubicles and hallways, where dozens of Kimek work at computers and screens, as if monitoring the whole city. At the end of what seems to be the main passage of the complex, you pass through a doorway to find the Lunarium leaders seated around a table. You're shown to a seat, and as Lobmab comes in at the end, one of the bodyguards announces, "Lady Lobmab Bebliss, head of our great House."`
	"CN-11396" `	Some of the others at the table look to one another, and one of the Kimek who accompanied you all the way from your ship sighs quietly before coming to Lobmab. "Most welcome you are, Lady Lobmab," he says, as he begins pointing to the leaders one by one, starting from your left with a Kimek. "Your host, Chiree is, the head of our local forces and organizer of many of our operations. Fought the Heliarchs since a young age, she has." He continues pointing to them in a clockwise pattern, now to the left of Chiree. "Likewise, been helping us for decades now, Tummug has, in spreading word of our group, and bringing to the people the truth about the Heliarchy. Another prominent Arach, and vital to the task soon to be discussed, Oobat is. A studious linguist, and aspiring diplomat, she is. Already worked together, I believe you and Pyakri have? One of our most senior militia officers, she is." He takes a pause, looking at Lobmab, almost as if waiting for some approval regarding his introductions of the others. She simply nods, and he moves on. "And... Elirom. A prominent Saryd Heliarch Arbiter who defected over a century ago. Been advising us since, he has." He waits for her to say something, before looking back at the table again and pointing to you. "Oh, of course. <first> <last>, the human, helped us greatly who has, and joining us today, who is."`
	"CN-11397" `	Satisfied with the introductions, Lobmab takes her seat, much to the Kimek's relief. "Very grateful we are, that made the time for this meeting you have, Lady Lobmab," Chiree says. "A special task for Captain <last>, we have, and wish to have all leaders present to discuss it, we did. But, first, welcome our newest member, we must," she says, looking at you. "Any questions for us have you, Captain?"`
	"CN-11398" `	"What are you all going to do if you do manage to take down the Heliarchs?"`
	"CN-11399" `	"You'll need to fight the Heliarchs at some point. Are you capable of doing that?"`
	"CN-11400" `	"Am I the only outsider helping you?"`
	"CN-11401" `	"How do you pay for all this?"`
	"CN-11402" `	"I'm fine for now. What about this task you need me for?"`
	"CN-11403" `	"Rebuild, first we will need to," Chiree responds. "Fight tooth and nail to remain in power, they will, so a great deal of damage to the Coalition, we expect."`
	"CN-11404" `	"Once back in order, everything is, focus on reassuring the populace we should. A change for the better, it will be, and help in making sure everyone realizes that, House Bebliss will," Lobmab jumps in. "Earn back what they took from us, we will."`
	"CN-11405" `	Once the head of House Bebliss is done, Chiree continues. "Pointless, our fight will have been, if corrupted in those rings again, our successors thousands of years from now become. Set up transparency measures and means to ensure that absolute power, the consuls do not have, we will."`
	"CN-11406" `	"Try and fool you, I will not. At a tremendous disadvantage, to say the least, we are," Pyakri answers. "Weaker, our ships are, and far less powerful weapons, we boast. Mostly human designs. Due to being simpler, easier to produce in what factories we have, they are. Also lack experience, the troops do..."`
	"CN-11407" `	The mood around the table quickly dims as she goes on listing the ways the Lunarium is lacking in comparison to your opponents. Elirom stands up, putting both hands on the table to draw attention. "Smarter than us, they are not. Assure you of that, I can. Wanting in many areas we are, yes, but only because hoard our best materials, they do. Already preparing some deadlier weapons, we are. Finished, the blueprints have been. Only lacking the right materials, we are. When secured those, we have, move on to reforming our arsenal we can, and maybe get some better ships produced, too."`
	"CN-11408" `	"And suppose I do that, intend to tell me where to attack for such materials, you do?" Pyakri asks as she stands up herself. "Caught by 'the unforeseen' will my men again be? By an Arach battalion you forgot to mention, again?"`
	"CN-11409" `	Caught off-guard by the question, apparently, Elirom looks at her for a few seconds, then resigns himself to sit back down.`
	"CN-11410" `	For a few seconds, they simply exchange looks at your question, until Lobmab speaks up. "Transmissions and messages from some source, Bebliss has received for centuries now. Told us they have of Heliarch activity, fleet movements, training drills, propaganda plans. Always exactly right in their predictions, the messages were. Also pointed us to equipment caches - caches with outfits previously found nowhere in the Coalition - they have. Human weaponry, blueprints, factory parts..."`
	"CN-11411" `	"Aware of the identity of whoever does it, we are not," Elirom says. "An arbiter I was, and though a great deal I knew, still kept from me, some critical information was. Possible, it is, that from one of the consuls, the information comes. Though, difficult to steal a jump drive to bring in the weapons, it would be, even for a consul." He pauses, a dead stare in his eyes as he bites lightly on a finger. "Also received word of... experiments, we have from the messages. Some manner of procedure to take over bodies... stop whatever it is being done in the rings, we must."`
	"CN-11412" `	The rest of the table look to Lobmab at the same time, prompting her explanation. "Amassed great fortune over our history, House Bebliss has. As part of our gracious help to the Lunarium, providing nearly everything in financial terms we have been."`
	"CN-11413" `	She stops, with the others still looking at her, as if expecting something more. She remains silent, so Chiree looks back at you, continuing, "Also taken some loans from House Plumtab in our stead, Houses Bebliss and Idriss have. Not terribly passionate for our cause, Plumtab's bankers are, but share our interest in booting the Heliarchs, they do, even if meet or talk with us, they never do."`
	"CN-11414" `	Tummug goes around the table, handing copies of some documents to the other leaders before answering. "One of the centerpoints of Heliarch propaganda, the fear of the Quarg is. Served to justify their budget, and their obsession with hoarding the military, for millennia it has. Thought up a way to mitigate the effect that has on the populace, Oobat has."`
	"CN-11415" `	With this cue, Oobat goes further into the plan. "Not seen in Coalition space in over six thousand years, a Quarg ship has been. Most likely moved on from our war, they have, unlike the Heliarchs. If proof of the Quarg's lack of interest in waging war against us, we had, spread it to the people, we could. Given the Captain's resourcefulness, and possession of a jump drive, think we did that the best way to acquire that proof, meeting up with the Quarg is." She grabs one of the documents, pointing to it. "For you all to review these questions, I would like. Careful we should be, with regard to their wording. Once done, we are, board Captain <last>'s ship, I will. Meet with the Quarg in human space, we must," she says the last part looking at you. "Met with the Quarg before, have you, Captain?"`
	"CN-11416" `	"No, sorry. I never had the time to visit one of their worlds or rings."`
	"CN-11417" `	"I've only seen them in pictures and videos."`
	"CN-11418" `	"Ah, a shame that is. Well, I suppose a first time for the both of us, this trip will be."`
	"CN-11419" `	"Yes. They can be a bit odd, but they've always treated me well."`
	"CN-11420" `	"Yes, sadly. They're obnoxious and condescending."`
	"CN-11421" `	"Good to hear, that is. Hope I do that willing to extend that treatment to me, they are."`
	"CN-11422" `	The table puts the documents away in unison, looking at you after your answer. "I see... well, at least cooperate for the interview, we can hope they will."`
	"CN-11423" `	The Lunarium leaders spend an hour or so going over the questions proposed for the interview, deciding to ditch some, and add a few new ones. All the while, Elirom asks in a worried manner if Oobat is sure of this idea. "Forgive me if sounding like a Heliarch, I am, but dangerous to leave, it is. Know we do not, the Quarg reaction to seeing someone from the Coalition in their territory."`
	"CN-11424" `	"Understand that, I do, but fine I will be. Unlike the Quarg it is, to attack unprovoked," she answers. "And if bad comes to worst, trust I do in Captain <last>'s abilities to ensure our escape." The leaders go over the interview questions a while longer, until they've reached a consensus as to its completeness. They wish you and Oobat good luck, and you both are escorted back out of the complex to your ship. There, Oobat asks you for the best place for such an interview in human space, and you point to <destination>, where the Quarg are constructing their ringworld. "Then head there, we must. In your care I will be, Captain." You show her to her bunk, and plot a course to <planet>.`
	"CN-11425" `Once you've docked in <origin>, you go check on Oobat, who's readying some form of camera while rehearsing the questions for the interview. "Just a moment Captain, ready in a minute I will be," she says. You head out of your ship and flag down the first Quarg you see.`
	"CN-11426" `	"How may I assist you, human?" it says.`
	"CN-11427" `	"I've brought an Arach from the Coalition. She wants to interview the Quarg."`
	"CN-11428" `	"I'm with a group from the Coalition, the Lunarium, who are fighting the Heliarchs. They want to talk to you, and have sent a diplomat with me."`
	"CN-11429" `	It stays silent, glancing over at your ship. "I see," it says. "Wait here. I will bring one who can speak on the matter." It moves away in a quickstep, briefly talking to some other Quarg along the way, who come to your ship and wait. Oobat comes out of your ship as you wait, causing a minor scene as some of the humans visiting the station panic at the sight of a giant spider. Others come closer, intrigued by the unknown alien, or perhaps thinking her to be some form of prop. Oobat doesn't pay them much mind though, instead focusing on the Quarg near the two of you, and watching the others in the distance.`
	"CN-11430" `	The Quarg around you dissuade the gawking humans from getting closer, and after a few more minutes a Quarg in faded, light gray robes comes to meet you. "Hello, human. And..."`
	"CN-11431" `	"Oobat, my name is," she says. "A member of the Lunarium Redoubt, a group in the Coalition created to fight the Heliarchs, I am. Assisted us much, Captain <last> has, and bring me here now they did, for wish to ask you some questions about your views on the Coalition, my group does."`
	"CN-11432" `	The Quarg gazes at you two for a few seconds, before squatting down to your level. "Very well. What questions do you have?"`
	"CN-11433" `	She hands you the camera, turning it on and asking that you keep it as still as you can once you're positioned to get a good angle. She then connects her translator to it remotely, so that the audio picks up the Quarg's translated responses. "Well, begin then we shall. Regarding the very reason for the Coalition's formation, intending to fight us again, are you?"`
	"CN-11434" `	It thinks for a moment, then answers, "No. We never intended to fight. It was the Saryds, Kimek and Arachi of old who fought us. We are not a warring people."`
	"CN-11435" `	Seemingly satisfied with the answer, Oobat moves on to the next. She questions the Quarg for about ten minutes on their activities outside the Coalition and their relation with the humans and other species. She even has you move the camera around for a bit to show the local human-Quarg interactions, as the Quarg compares dealing with humanity to dealing with the Coalition species. Oobat moves from question to question as if in a checklist, until she arrives at the last one. "About finished, we are. Thankful for your answers I am. Just one last thing, to appease the people back home. Interested in returning to take back the rings, are you?"`
	"CN-11436" `	"Of course," it says without hesitation. "The rings are our homes. My home." Clearly not expecting that answer, Oobat looks at you in confusion.`
	"CN-11437" `	"It's been thousands of years. You're still lingering on those rings?"`
	"CN-11438" `	"If you want them back, why haven't you returned by now?"`
	"CN-11439" `	"Lingering on... 'those' rings? Our rings. Our homes," it replies. "Do you so easily forget yours?" The Quarg crosses one arm, grabbing its shoulder, lowering its head as its back curves. Patches of skin start turning pitch black, and it brings its other arm to its head as if in pain.`
	"CN-11440" `	"Because that would have forced a fight. The three... these Heliarchs, would not listen. They never listened," it answers, crossing one arm and grabbing its shoulder, lowering its head as its back curves. Patches of skin start turning pitch black, and it brings its other arm to its head as if in pain.`
	"CN-11441" `	By now the atmosphere's changed, with no humans in sight around you. Dozens more Quarg begin to form circles around your ship, eyes fixated on Oobat. The ones closest to you watch the one who was being interviewed carefully, like waiting for some sign, as its whole body shifts color. Oobat is still looking at you, confusion and worry written on her face.`
	"CN-11442" `	"I think that does it for the interview."`
	"CN-11443" `	"We should leave. Now."`
	"CN-11444" `	She nods, and gives a quick "thank you" to the Quarg again, turning to go back inside your ship. The Quarg stops her though, reaching out one arm quickly to grab one of her legs. Slowly, its skin turns back to the grayish blue from before, as it calms down. "Should you succeed, please, permit my return home." The Quarg around you disperse, and the one who was interviewed stands up again and moves back to other sections of the station.`
	"CN-11445" `	You board your ship with Oobat, and hand her back the camera. "Mostly well, it went," she says, looking through the sped up footage and pausing at certain moments where the Quarg is responding. "Not what we expected from that last question, it was, however. Disappointed, I imagine Elirom will be." She tells you she'll be working on some basic edits to the footage, and says you may return to <planet>.`
	"CN-11446" `When you and Oobat reach the Lunarium's complex, you're welcomed back by Chiree, Elirom and Tummug. "Tell you I did that come back safely, they would," Tummug says to Elirom. "So, good enough to use in our efforts, was it?"`
	"CN-11447" `	Oobat shows them the recording, satisfaction clear on their faces as they listen to the Quarg. The mood darkens when the last question appears, however. Once it ends, Elirom stands up and heads to the nearest wall, slamming an arm onto it. Chiree sighs, and turns to Tummug, "Worth using still, is the footage?"`
	"CN-11448" `	"Up until that one? Yes, of course. Need to edit it for a cleaner, quicker video, we do, but a great piece it will be," he says. "That last part though, go as we expected, it did not."`
	"CN-11449" `	"Only prove the Heliarchs right, that last question would," Elirom chimes in. "Matter not, it does, if a thousand times the footage disproves their narrative. If even one thing, pick and spin as proof of their side they can, fruitless, the effort will be." He pauses, then hits the wall again, with less force. "Play it again, could you?" Oobat obliges, and plays the recording once again. Elirom has it paused a few times over the course of the video, breaking out a device to write down some notes. Once he's finished, he has the last portion repeated a few times still, seeming particularly interested in the Quarg's changing pigment. "Onyx black..." he ponders out loud, "what was, again, the emotion of that color?" Snapping out of the trance only after a few more repetitions, he hands Oobat the notes. "Right they were about the Quarg wanting to take the rings back... A shame it is, that use that point against them we cannot. Though, maybe, if interested in the rings they still are after so long..."`
	"CN-11450" `	He exits without saying anything else, leaving everyone else confused with his abrupt departure. "Much to take in at once, it must be, for him in particular. A Heliarch he once was, after all," Tummug says. "Get to work on perfecting the footage, and readying it for release to the public, we should."`
	"CN-11451" `	Oobat agrees, and the two prepare to leave with the footage. "A unique experience the trip was, Captain. Hope I do that work together again, we soon will."`
	"CN-11452" `	"Same here. It was different from my usual jobs, working a camera and all."`
	"CN-11453" `	"Anytime. Just, let's find some more normal people to interview, next time."`
	"CN-11454" `	She chuckles, and nods before leaving the room, following Tummug out of the Lunarium complex.`
	"CN-11455" `	Chiree approaches you and hands you a small box. You pick it up, and upon cursory examination, notice it's one of the Coalition's translation devices. "One of us you now are, so capable of understanding what we say without others aiding you, you should be," she says. "Still readying ourselves for major assaults on the Heliarchs, we are. A difficult fight against them, we will have, all the way. Hoping, I am, that with your help we can count, when the time comes."`
	"CN-11456" `	You look to Chiree, and see her brushing her frontmost left leg with the tip of her right one, as if cleaning away something. Once she's done, you see various bolts and a metal texture revealed. "Lose two of my legs to a Heliarch attack, I did. Grown used to the prosthetics, I have, but faded from my memory, that day has not." She stares at you. "Aware, we are, that helped the Heliarchs before, you have. Ask about specifics, I did not, for wish to know, I do not. Harmless work, it may have been. Or, helped them mutilate others like me, you may have." She approaches you, handing you a small box: one of the Coalition's translation devices. "One of us, you now are. Hear of any more aid to the Heliarchs from your side, I will not."`
	"CN-11457" `	You say your goodbyes, and you're escorted out of the complex and back to your ship. The Kimek who brought you there enter the ship with you briefly, and inform you that they've sent word across their major bases in the Coalition about your joining up. You're told that you'll find some new outfits available in their secretive outfitters. "In separate portions of the cities, sometimes in other cities entirely, our shops are, but safe from Heliarch patrols, they so far have proven." They give you a short list of the planets where you'll find their outfitters, and coordinates and instructions as to how to get to and access each of them.`
	"CN-11458" `	When they leave, you start tinkering with the translation device, figuring out how to configure it to translate each of the languages. After testing it using local transmissions and broadcasts for half an hour or so, you're decently fast with it, to the point where you can change what language it translates to or from a few times in a second.`
	"CN-11459" `	It may be a long time still before the Lunarium is ready to take up arms against the Heliarchs, so for now you figure you could help by looking into what minor jobs they may have for you.`
	"CN-11460" `(You have joined both the Coalition's Lunarium and Heliarch factions due to an unintended bug. Please choose which side you prefer to be with.)`
	"CN-11461" `	(Side with the Heliarchs.)`
	"CN-11462" `	(Side with the Lunarium.)`
	"CN-11463" `	(You've sided with the Lunarium.)`
	"CN-11464" `	(You've sided with the Heliarchs.)`
	"CN-11465" `A voice says, "This system is off limits. You should leave."`
	"CN-11466" `	After a second, you realize that the voice did not come from your communications equipment. In fact, now that you think about it, you're not sure if it was an audible voice, or just something in your head.`
	"CN-11467" `	"Why should I leave?"`
	"CN-11468" `	"You can't tell me what to do."`
	"CN-11469" `	"You should leave." The thought repeats itself, insistently. Either you're going crazy, or a creature is communicating with you telepathically.`
	"CN-11470" `	You feel as if a vast and patient creature has just heaved an immense sigh. "Human, you would do well not to ignore the warning of an Archon. I am here to warn off those who might be harmed by the swarm intelligence that infests this system. If you remain here long your ship will be digested by the swarm."`
	"CN-11471" `	You recall that "Archon" is what Drak ships are called.`
	"CN-11472" `	"What do you mean, 'digested'?"`
	"CN-11473" `	"What is a 'swarm intelligence'?"`
	"CN-11474" `	"I mean that your ship will be broken down into its component parts." You notice, as the voice says this, that your shields are registering small energy bursts, as if they are being struck by invisible weapons.`
	"CN-11475" `	"What is this swarm?" you ask.`
	"CN-11476" `	"Self-replicating miniature robots," the voice replies. "A weapon created by the Korath, the last of their great abominations. If you wish to feed your ship to the swarm, I will not stop you, but they already possess enough raw material here without your assistance." The voice's tone, inasmuch as a disembodied imaginary voice can be said to have a tone, is sardonic.`
	"CN-11477" `	"Okay, okay, I'll get out of here."`
	"CN-11478" `	"Wait, I have more questions."`
	"CN-11479" `	You ask, "Why don't you just destroy the swarm, if it is so dangerous?"`
	"CN-11480" `	The voice says, "Because if the Korath manage to drive themselves extinct, this intelligence will be their last and greatest surviving creation, and we will preserve it as a living memorial to them. Please do not interfere here." When the voice speaks the phrase, "drive themselves extinct," the words are accompanied by an emotion that you cannot put a name to.`
	"CN-11481" `	Also, the empty space around your ship is beginning to light up with small sparks, like an angry swarm of fireflies.`
	"CN-11482" `	"Well, it's an honor to meet you. I'll be leaving now."`
	"CN-11483" `	"Why do you care if they go extinct?"`
	"CN-11484" `	"Our directive is to enforce peace and prevent extinction," says the voice. As before, the words "prevent extinction" echo loud in your mind as if underlined by a nameless emotion. "Now, enough questions," says the voice.`
	"CN-11485" `	The presence inside your head seems to fall away, and you are left talking to thin air.`
	"CN-11486" `While navigating the skies of this desert world, you notice readings similar to the planet where you previously encountered a member of the Gegno Vi. It's likely this world is also home to the same or a similar species of large, worm-like creatures you confronted back then. Eventually, you come across a large Gegno Vi vessel stationed on the surface, though unlike in your prior encounter, the ship isn't sunken into the desert - it has likely landed here recently. A group of Vi warriors are marching out and nearby the vessel, and while they do, your radar picks up two more ships descending from above.`
	"CN-11487" `	(Continue to observe.)`
	"CN-11488" `	The approaching ships continue their descent, paying you no attention. They appear to be ones that were in orbit when you first entered the system. One of them is the same model as the one on the ground, likely some type of transport. The other, however, isn't one you've seen before. It looks like some sort of interceptor vessel, though it is definitely larger than something like a Sparrow from human space, maybe even the size of a Headhunter. Perhaps that ship belongs to someone of importance.`
	"CN-11489" `	In any case, considering that the planet is home to more of those monsters from before, and the Vi are here in numbers, it might be best you take your leave now before the situation gets out of control again.`
	"CN-11490" `	(Approach the landing zone.)`
	"CN-11491" `	Throttling your ship forward, you head towards the Vi's landing zone. While the other transport vessel has touched down already, the interceptor, still in the process of landing, suddenly whips around to face you as you approach. Unlike the Scin's warships you confronted a few days ago, which were more reactive to your presence than direct about it, the Vi here are now going out of their way to approach your ship. A moment later, you receive what sounds like an angry hail from the interceptor.`
	"CN-11492" `	"Tchii ciei escitch tchii iedf teih Voordhte!"`
	"CN-11493" `	(Leave now.)`
	"CN-11494" `	(Continue.)`
	"CN-11495" `	You decide it's best to not encroach on the Vi's area any more, as there's no telling what they'd do if you continued to do so. Once you back off, the interceptor briefly jerks forward at you in a vexed manner, continuing to observe you until you've left the area. While the Scin seemed more open to interaction, the Vi are clearly averse to it.`
	"CN-11496" `	You decide to continue flying towards the Vi without heeding their warning. With no hesitation, the interceptor begins to charge at you, and the ships on the surface start preparing for takeoff. Even some of the Vi soldiers on the ground are shouting and gesturing toward your vessel with their weapons. It would seem the Vi are no longer tolerant of your presence.`
	"CN-11497" `	You decide to withdraw from the area, and the ships continue on their way toward the surface as if you were never there. Regardless of whether or not they could have been hostile, getting mixed up with what may be some sort of military exercise could be dangerous, especially with the Vi.`
	"CN-11498" `As you enter the system, you notice that there is both a Vi and a Scin fleet at the center, although neither of them is engaging the other. Instead, they are observing a pair of ships, one from each side, that appear to be challenging one another. Maybe this is some sort of ceremonial event between the Gegno factions. It's probably best not to interfere.`
	"CN-11499" `The presence of scattered old recording instruments on the surface of this planet seems to contradict the apparent disinterest with which the Gegno appear to be treating it. Despite its location within the Gegno's home system of Heutesl, the planet is apparently deserted. Still, since this planet isn't strictly controlled by the Gegno, it makes for a convenient place to stop, and they seem to neither notice nor care that you have landed here.`
	"CN-11500" `	However, as you fly around, you notice a small Gegno shuttle parked on the ground. The tan coloration of its hull suggests that it's a civilian craft, but what it's doing here is unknown.`
	"CN-11501" `	You steer your ship toward the shuttle, and once you approach it, you are able to see a Gegno on the ground fiddling with one of the nearby devices. As you fly closer, they stop their work and return to their shuttle, taking off shortly after. It seems like they weren't interested in any potential interaction with you.`
	"CN-11502" `	Landing beside the satellite, you step out to take a look. The device is indistinguishable from any of the others you have seen so far. Its only notable feature seems to be its advanced age.`
	"CN-11503" `Nothing is of much interest on this cold, unwelcoming moon in the middle of nowhere. However, there's something about the surface of Cyife that is a bit peculiar. Some of the light refracted through the surface seemingly dissipates or reflects back in strange patterns. Although it appears to be ice, more detailed inspection reveals that small patches of the terrain seem to instead be made of some other type of crystalline material. In the distance is something that truly stands out on this world - a large egg-shaped structure with a green hue to it.`
	"CN-11504" `	Once you get close enough, the oblong object reveals itself to be some sort of large Gegno ship with the coloring of the Scin faction. What it's doing this far away from their home space is a mystery, much like the moon it's stationed on. After a few seconds, it launches into the atmosphere and leaves the moon. There doesn't seem to be anything left where it was parked, nor any trace of what the Scin were doing here to begin with.`
	"CN-11505" `	Once you get close enough, the oblong object is revealed to be a large Gegno Scin ship, similar to the one you encountered during an interaction with the Scin a while ago. What it's doing this far away from their home space is a mystery, much like the moon it's stationed on. Or at least, was stationed on, as after a few seconds it launches into the atmosphere and leaves the moon.`
	"CN-11506" `	Once you get close enough, the oblong object reveals itself to be one of the Gegno Scin's large research ships, the same kind that you entered during an interaction with the Scin a while ago. It's possible the Scin found the mysteriousness of Cyife worth traveling so far from their home space to investigate. You'll never know for certain as after a few seconds, the ship launches into the atmosphere and disappears into space. They didn't seem to leave anything behind.`
	"CN-11507" `Although this planet is uninhabited, there are more than a few Gegno Scin ships currently parked across the surface. It seems like there's an ongoing operation to continue constructing what infrastructure has been built in the past, and the hard-working Scin pay little to no attention to your visit.`
	"CN-11508" `	However, a few moments later, the Scin suddenly start scurrying to their ships. Based on your experiences so far, you haven't gotten close enough to alarm them. They begin taking off one by one in a hurried fashion, but not toward you - the <ship>'s sensors suddenly begin picking up a large Gegno Vi fleet entering the system. It appears that this place is turning into a battlefield, and getting caught up in the middle of it is likely something you should avoid.`
	"CN-11509" `After you go through your post-docking routine and enter the ringworld, you can't help but feel that something is a bit off. Normally, the Quarg here would be swiftly walking about, focused on their duties, but for some reason, there seem to be fewer of them around than usual. Moreover, those you do come across are occasionally having discussions with one another, sometimes looking in your direction even for the slightest moment. What stands out the most is the utter lack of any Gegno in the area you're visiting.`
	"CN-11510" `	A few minutes later, while you are making your way through the pristine interior of the ring, you hear a voice call to you from down one of the various branching corridors. Turning around, you recognize the unique attire of the Quarg who has helped you in the past, along with a few others. "Circumstantial greetings once more, <first> <last>. Might we have a significant moment of your attention?"`
	"CN-11511" `	"How long will it take?"`
	"CN-11512" `	"As long as is required, for this matter is of symbolic importance," it says, with a slightly elevated tone.`
	"CN-11513" `	You follow the group of Quarg to a smaller discussion room, similar to the one you've previously visited. Or perhaps you've been visiting a different room each time, considering how unfathomably large a ringworld is. Once you sit down, the Quarg from before looks at you for a moment, looks down at the table, then back up to you.`
	"CN-11514" `	"Formerly, I have offered suggestions of heedful interplay regarding the Gegno. We have been alerted of a few additional encounters you have experienced, although they seemed minimal in nature. In such cases, it has been generally described that you left in a timely manner, for which we are notably appreciative. However," the Quarg continues, "despite your efforts in recommended cautions, there are some Gegno figures of meaningful standing that expressed frustration in your trivial appearances. They inquired of us as to the possibility of unnecessary reoccurrences."`
	"CN-11515" `	"Why does this frustrate them?"`
	"CN-11516" `	"I haven't done any harm to them."`
	"CN-11517" `	"It was more coincidental than anything."`
	"CN-11518" `	"I wish to learn more about them."`
	"CN-11519" `	"One need not invoke violence to greatly harm another. However purest intentions may be, even the smallest unbeknownst action may rapidly tumble to one not forseenly desired." The Quarg then ponders for a moment.`
	"CN-11520" `	"Even a mere brief coincidence may cause a result not desired, nor foreseen, by the instigator. All living things owe their existence to series of arbitrary coincidences." The Quarg then ponders for a moment.`
	"CN-11521" `	"Not always does the desire to learn lead to pleasant opportunities. The most curious of creatures can easily be harmed when naive to the nature of their interests." The Quarg then ponders for a moment.`
	"CN-11522" `	"Imagine, if you will, during the substantial conflicts the humans call the Turf Wars, a strange alien came to human space. We Quarg woefully witnessed that hazardous conflict - it was a time of great waste, unfortunate peril, and unsavory distrust among humanity. The Gegno are in a vulnerable state notably comparable to such a time, and introduction of outsiders would not befit the case. The truth remains that we have been contacted by a few Gegno of importance in respect to your past presences, and there has been a show of concern surrounding your unstated intentions." After a brief pause, the Quarg looks to you in a strange manner, and you aren't sure what to make of it. "Though, unexpectedly, a select few times we have also been curiously asked of your origins, an experience we are not strongly familiar with involving the Gegno."`
	"CN-11523" `	The Quarg leaves its chair and motions you to do the same.`
	"CN-11524" `	(Stand up.)`
	"CN-11525" `	"Our best of recommendations to you is to avoid further contact in the coming future. Meanwhile, we shall attempt a most careful negotiation with their hierarchy to come to terms of a ground of acceptance for your presence. Should we find commonality, you will receive communication from one of the title 'Adrauni,' as has been bestowed upon me."`
	"CN-11526" `	The rest of the Quarg, who have been listening to the conversation attentively the whole time, begin to escort you out of the room. If the Gegno are willing to go as far as to contact the Quarg about your appearances, then this is truly an important matter to them. For the time being, it's probably best to allow the Quarg to find some kind of resolution with the Gegno while you keep your distance.`
	"CN-11527" `	"Formerly, I have offered suggestions of heedful interplay regarding the Gegno. However, we are increasingly aware of correlative happenings upon them involving yourself. It would seem consequential events have indeed occurred. Not often previously were we approached by Gegno, but on a few notable occasions now have meaningful figures sought us out for inquiry - most notably due to violent circumstances." The Quarg stares at you for an extended period of time, waiting for some kind of answer.`
	"CN-11528" `	"They attacked me first."`
	"CN-11529" `	"I wanted to get their attention."`
	"CN-11530" `	"Violence happens all the time in human space, but the Quarg don't seem interested in it."`
	"CN-11531" `	The Quarg continues to look at you for a while longer before answering. "Based on some principles, I may see reason for them to be... inclined... to do such. However, to do so in this case would not align with their elder's interests, nor would any fabrications." The Quarg blinks at you, then ponders for a moment.`
	"CN-11532" `	The Quarg blinks. "And you found a suitable solution to your... problem... by instigating unprovoked hostilities?" The Quarg then continues to stare at you in what you presume to be a judgemental manner for an awkward amount of time, before looking away to ponder to itself.`
	"CN-11533" `	The Quarg takes a long moment to ponder your statement, as if it wasn't expecting such a response. "Indeed, it is known that conflict is commonly natural amongst you quarrelsome humans. But this matter is of another sort." The Quarg then thinks to itself again for a little longer.`
	"CN-11534" `	"Imagine, if you will, during the substantial conflicts the humans call the Turf Wars, a hostile alien came to human space. We Quarg woefully witnessed that hazardous conflict - it was a time of great waste, unfortunate peril, and unsavory distrust among humanity. The Gegno are in a vulnerable state notably comparable to such a time, and introduction of even more hostilities would not befit the case, especially of those from the outside. We have been contacted by numerous Gegno members of high standing and wish for this to be a matter only of further strict cautionaries, but regrettably, the Gegno believe it a matter beyond attentiveness." The Quarg leaves its chair and motions you to do the same.`
	"CN-11535" `	"You are recommended for departure from Gegno space as of this decisive moment. Meanwhile, we shall attempt a most careful negotiation with their hierarchy to come to terms of an acceptable toleration of sorts. Should we find commonality, you will receive communication from one of the title 'Adrauni,' as has been bestowed upon me."`
	"CN-11536" `	As the rest of the Quarg escort you out of the room, the Quarg named 'Adrauni' addresses you one last time. "Do avoid any further violent tendencies, Captain." If the Gegno are willing to go as far as to contact the Quarg, then this is truly an important matter to them. For the time being, it's probably best to listen to the Quarg's warnings this time around and leave Gegno space until some kind of resolution is found, if at all.`
	"CN-11537" `Once you land on the ringworld, you are greeted by a small group of Quarg who quickly motion you to follow them. They escort you through various halls of the ring, which still appear to lack the presence of any Gegno. Down at the end of the next corridor, you see Adrauni waiting for you, though beside it is a Gegno in some form of strange attire. Once you meet up with them, the other Quarg head off in a different direction, and Adrauni begins walking down another hallway. "Please, indulge in accompanying us."`
	"CN-11538" `	As you follow them, Adrauni begins to speak while holding out one arm. "If you may, as humans say, humor me, what do you suspect was the result of my negotiations with the Gegno?"`
	"CN-11539" `	"That they will accept me?"`
	"CN-11540" `	"That they want nothing to do with me?"`
	"CN-11541" `	After a brief delay, Adrauni turns to the Gegno, mutters something in their language, then responds to you. "I see. And what do you propose is the reasoning for that?"`
	"CN-11542" `	"I've helped them before, and I could help them now."`
	"CN-11543" `	"I figured you could convince them."`
	"CN-11544" `	Adrauni ponders for a few moments as you continue walking through the impeccable interior of the ringworld. "That is a rather human response. However, do not conflate your value in assistance with theirs. Even should you provide beneficial assistance to the Gegno, a beneficent response in return is not necessitated. You have heeded my warnings at this juncture, yet you simply are doing what the Gegno desired from the beginning, and that is leaving them alone."`
	"CN-11545" `	"Maybe it's better I do leave them alone."`
	"CN-11546" `	"There must be something I can do."`
	"CN-11547" `	Adrauni gives you a slight glare while continuing through the ringworld. "Do you not recall my prior mention of us Quarg having attempted such desired persuasions? It is not within our ability to convince the Gegno of anything. They are greatly devoted to their own, and will go beyond any boundary to oppose counsel, even by us Quarg."`
	"CN-11548" `	"The way they act around me."`
	"CN-11549" `	"From what you've told me before."`
	"CN-11550" `	"Indeed, the Gegno are wary of you, who lack caution." A few seconds pass, and Adrauni gives a strange look towards the Gegno. You aren't sure what it's thinking. The Gegno seems to ask a question in their language, but receives no response. Adrauni pauses a while longer before speaking again. "Despite that, you have found yourself in precarious situations we have not. We as a species embraced contact with the Gegno; however, you remain the only human here. Perhaps therein lies a notable implication of distinction."`
	"CN-11551" `	"Are you saying there's something I can do?"`
	"CN-11552" `	"I'm not sure I understand."`
	"CN-11553" `	"I see." Adrauni blinks slowly while staring at you. It's almost as if it is surprised, or at the very least, not expecting that response. "Wise it is that you follow my fortunate instruction. If it weren't as such, I may not be the one speaking with you in this moment. Or, perhaps, it would be no one." It then looks forward again as you continue on your stroll, leaving you to think on those words. "Unfortunately, the Quarg are unable to further assist you in this delicate matter. If you recall, we have attempted prior counsel with the Gegno, yet bound they are in their ways, even should it mean incredulously opposing us Quarg."`
	"CN-11554" `	Adrauni turns to you briefly, staring at you blankly, then turns to the Gegno and mutters something in their language before responding to you. "And why is it that you are unsure?"`
	"CN-11555" `	"I wasn't sure you could convince them."`
	"CN-11556" `	"I don't know anything about them."`
	"CN-11557" `	After a pause, Adrauni turns toward you, glares at you briefly, then looks back forward as the three of you continue through the ring. "Quite an important conclusion, is that not? Many times I have said this, that the Gegno are not what I would consider humans to possess knowledge of. Should you learn more, I'm afraid even then that the Gegno do not contrastingly desire, what was the human word - camaraderie?" The Gegno then asks something in their language, and Adrauni begins a somewhat lengthy conversation with them.`
	"CN-11558" `	The Quarg turns back to you. "You are here not at the whim of your fanatic species, but at your own behest. Actions you take may be that of a human, but are not willed by that of humanity." Blinking slowly, Adrauni then turns to the Gegno walking besides it and begins a somewhat lengthy conversation with them.`
	"CN-11559" `	You walk in silence for an awkward period of time. The strange architecture of the ringworld does little to comfort you; it feels like you've walked down the same path several times now. A few moments later, you eventually begin following Adrauni and the Gegno down what appears to be a different section, though it is strangely wider than previous ones. Before you begin asking more questions, Adrauni finally replies. "It is apparent that you may understand something of your fragile circumstance. It is no longer what I, rather, the Quarg, can do for you. It is what you can do for yourself."`
	"CN-11560" `	Adrauni speaks to the Gegno once more for an extended period of time. The strange architecture of the ringworld does little to comfort you; it feels like you've walked down the same path several times now. A few moments later, you eventually begin following Adrauni and the Gegno down what appears to be a different section, though it is strangely wider than previous ones. "Yes, it may be that your timely departure is the most favorable outcome in this affair." A long, awkward silence ensues, at the end of which Adrauni briefly comes to a halt, still facing forward, now crossing its arms behind its back. "Though you and I figure that is... unlikely."`
	"CN-11561" `	The Gegno leaves the two of you upon the entrance to a separate hallway, and you follow Adrauni to one last stop. You are at the end of your seemingly long trip through the ringworld, finding yourself back where you started - the docking facility where your ship is stationed. Although it felt like a dizzying maze to follow Adrauni around back to here, you can't help but imagine how much more confusing it would be to explore the entirety of a ringworld, considering that was only several minutes worth. Adrauni stops and turns to you, slightly lowering itself to speak closer to your own height. "You must seek audience on your own, tenacious, behalf. Visit the Gegno homeworld of Dueyu Eitch, present yourself in a manner that you desire to be perceived. Only then will you find your desired answer."`
	"CN-11562" `	"Won't they prevent me from landing?"`
	"CN-11563" `	"Couldn't we have just asked the Gegno from earlier?"`
	"CN-11564" `	"I'm not sure that's safe. Could you escort me there?"`
	"CN-11565" `	"Thank you. I will leave now."`
	"CN-11566" `	"Contrarily, I rather believe them to be expecting of you. Do remember you must hail the planet for clearance."`
	"CN-11567" `	Adrauni ponders your question for a few moments before answering. "Ah, yes, your naivety to Gegno culture had but briefly passed me. Tradition amongst female Scin is to allocate time of research just short of a lifespan. The one whom you speak of is very much devoted to us here, nothing more. For any official matters with the Gegno to pass, they must go through the great heart of the colony."`
	"CN-11568" `	Adrauni blinks at you. "I would have hoped you understood what was meant by your previous realization." It looks off to the side in deep thought, then back to you. "Habitually, we Quarg scarcely visit the Gegno for the most minor of reasons. Should you be accompanied at this time, the Gegno's unstable perception of you would alter further. Imagine if the Quarg visited your own planet called Earth with strange others in tow." You guess that Adrauni then does what the Quarg equivalent of a sigh would be. "However, yes, I am capable of sending you an escort. Be certain in this decision."`
	"CN-11569" `	"Yes, I would like an escort."`
	"CN-11570" `	"Actually, I should be fine."`
	"CN-11571" `	Adrauni hesitantly responds. "I shall send for one upon your departure."`
	"CN-11572" `	"I see. May it be for the best, then."`
	"CN-11573" `	"Safe travels, <first> <last>. I aspire for your daring decisions to befit the wise on your journey ahead." Adrauni gives you a lengthy bow, then leaves the hangar. You get the feeling that this might have been the last time you meet with it. As you return to your ship, a few other Quarg, who have been watching the conversation from afar, also return to their normal routine as if nothing had happened. Now, it is up to you to see for yourself whether or not the Gegno will accept you.`
	"CN-11574" `Once you land on the ringworld, you notice a group of Gegno off to the side of the hangar you are stationed in. They have the hulking appearance of Vi warriors, and while they aren't moving from their position, they watch you intently as you exit your ship. A small group of Quarg then approach you and quickly motion you to follow them, escorting you through various halls of the ring. Eventually you are led to the room where you met Adrauni in the past, or perhaps one identical to it. "Please, seat yourself."`
	"CN-11575" `	You sit down, along with two other Quarg, and the rest of them leave the room with the door sliding shut behind them. Adrauni stares blankly at you for a while, then speaks. "I presume you understand what result came from my negotiations with the tedious Gegno."`
	"CN-11576" `	"That they are upset with me?"`
	"CN-11577" `	"That they will tolerate me?"`
	"CN-11578" `	"No, I do not."`
	"CN-11579" `	Adrauni continues to stare at you, then slowly blinks. "I see. What is your strange understanding of the term 'tolerate' in this capacity?"`
	"CN-11580" `	"Permission to land on their worlds."`
	"CN-11581" `	"Allow me access to their technology."`
	"CN-11582" `	Adrauni ponders for a few moments. "That is a rather human response. Although we Quarg are, by your definition, minimally tolerant of your species, access to only some of our wondrous worlds we give you. However, what of humans to others? Should the Gegno, or species of other eccentricities, be given leisure to your planet Earth? It may be the case with you, though with anxious humanity, it certainly would not be." One of the other Quarg in the room says something to Adrauni, to which it responds with a conversation in its own language.`
	"CN-11583" `	"Is there no way I can work with the Gegno?"`
	"CN-11584" `	"I guess I should leave them alone."`
	"CN-11585" `	Adrauni clicks its teeth together in what appears to be a laughing manner, a reaction you have yet to see from it. "And we many Quarg, of those who live among ambitious humans, allowance of our technology have we given? One is not owed rights to another's inventions under pretensive tolerance." The other Quarg in the room look at Adrauni strangely, after which it begins a conversation with them in their own language. After a few moments, they too stare at you with strange looks, followed by an awkward silence, which is broken by Adrauni speaking to you once more. "With us as well, hardly do the Gegno share much of intrigue at all."`
	"CN-11586" `	"Then is there no way I can work with the Gegno?"`
	"CN-11587" `	"Indeed, you do not. To tolerate is to authorize unrestricted occurrence despite undesired preface. In this lies not the Gegno's interest, as once I have said before." It looks up in thought for several moments. "Perhaps in your naive judgment I am mistaken. Humans tolerate their own undesirables, those who have come to be known as corsairs. Portions of your species permit their tiresome actions, while others do not. Be that as it may, suppose a species other than humanity begins similar agitation. I would presume the case to be different." Adrauni then begins a conversation with the other Quarg in the room.`
	"CN-11588" `	"Are you saying there's no way I can work with the Gegno?"`
	"CN-11589" `	"It would be evidently so, given that those of the Vi themselves have brazenly entered our ring. A show of force is most unprecedented, even more so opposed to other means of less immodest communication. I had the slightest hope you understood my preachings of nonviolence, as I believe there to be benefit from optimistic aspirations in younger species, but ultimately my hopes are proven unfounded." Some of the other Quarg in the room abruptly address Adrauni as if you weren't present and begin a long period of debate, occasionally punctuated by glares in your direction.`
	"CN-11590" `	"Yes, I believe that to be a common theme in this extraneous situation. It is quite a dangerous practice to commit an act before knowledge, as we Quarg have been advising you impulsive humans for many years. In our discussions with you, evident it is that this has proven to be true. However, the great bounds stepped beyond here go beyond what we are able to accommodate." Adrauni then changes its expression slightly, glowering at you again. "Particularly after continual warnings prior." One of the other Quarg in the room says something to Adrauni, to which it begins a conversation in its own language.`
	"CN-11591" `	You sit in silence for an uncomfortable amount of time, during which even the Quarg don't speak to one another. The strange structure and bright lights of the room do little to reassure you as the Quarg ponder to themselves. A few moments later, they begin talking amongst themselves once more, but you don't have a chance to get a word in. After several more minutes of deliberation and strange looks, the other Quarg stand up and flank you from both sides, while Adrauni finally addresses you once more. "Unfortunately, at this stage of events, not I, nor the Quarg, can give you an answer to your inquiry. We are of agreement in our strong opposition to further interaction between yourself and the Gegno." It then does what you think would be the Quarg equivalent of a sigh.`
	"CN-11592" `	You sit in silence for an uncomfortable period of time, during which even the Quarg don't speak to one another. The strange structure and bright lights of the room do little to reassure you as the Quarg ponder to themselves. A few moments later, they begin talking amongst themselves once more, but you don't have a chance to get a word in. After several more minutes of deliberation and strange looks, the other Quarg stand up and flank you from both sides, while Adrauni finally addresses you once more. "Indeed, that statement is in our strongest of preferences for this matter." It stands up and crosses its arms behind its back. "Though I would suppose you and I figure that to be... unlikely."`
	"CN-11593" `	The door opens behind you, and the Quarg motion you to follow them once more, escorting you out of the room and back to the hangar your ship is parked in. There seem to be a few more Quarg walking the corridors than usual, some stationed among various entrances. You can't help but remember that this is only one small section of the ring, making the rest of it seem even more impossibly large and filled with Quarg. Once you return to the hangar, you're greeted by the sight of the Vi warriors being blocked off by a larger group of Quarg, although there doesn't seem to be any intentions of hostility, nor conversation, from either side. Adrauni then stops in front of you. "It is no longer in our jurisdiction to assist you in this. However, if you indeed continue to pursue this desire to associate with the Gegno, you must seek audience yourself. Visit the Gegno homeworld of Dueyu Eitch, present yourself in a manner that you desire to be perceived. Only then will you find the answer to your whims."`
	"CN-11594" `	"Won't they deny me from landing?"`
	"CN-11595" `	"Couldn't we just ask the Gegno over there?"`
	"CN-11596" `	"I will be leaving now."`
	"CN-11597" `	After a pause, Adrauni responds. "Contrarily, I rather believe them to be expecting of you, accounting for their exclamations of the situation."`
	"CN-11598" `	"Those of the Vi do not represent those of the Gegno, that is, of a whole species. The Vi present with us are merely of one family, to which there are many such groups." Adrauni considers your question for a few moments, almost appearing to have a slight interest in it. "It is unlike that of which you humans are familiar to. Vi culture does not denote a family merely by ancestry nor familiarity."`
	"CN-11599" `	"Although your actions thus far are in dissatisfaction, I aspire for future decisions being made to befit the wise on your journey ahead. I wish you an educational journey, <first> <last>." Adrauni gives you a lengthy bow, then leaves the hangar. You get the feeling that this might have been the last time you meet with it. As you return to your ship, the Vi warriors continue watching from afar, but the Quarg steadfastly block them off. It is up to you to figure out yourself whether or not the Gegno will tolerate you any further.`
	"CN-11600" `While you are in the midst of docking with the ringworld, you notice a large tan-colored Gegno ship already present in your designated hangar, surrounded by several ships from both the factions of the Vi and Scin. Near them, a small group of Quarg are debating something with a smaller group of Gegno who seem rather upset. As soon as you exit your ship, both groups stop and look your way. You recognize Adrauni swiftly approaching you alongside a Gegno that is wearing a very intricate set of armor, neither Scin nor Vi in appearance.`
	"CN-11601" `	Adrauni does not hesitate to address you. "<first> <last>. I presume you understand the meaning of this affair."`
	"CN-11602" `	"I'm not sure what's happening right now."`
	"CN-11603" `	"I think I understand the gist of it."`
	"CN-11604" `	The Quarg now stands in front of you, slightly lowering to speak to you. "As so happens to be the arduous case, several complaints we Quarg have received from the Gegno. Meddled in their affairs you have, one too many times. As much of a desire I have to converse with you more on the matter, not I, nor the Quarg, will be of any further help to you in your endeavors here." Adrauni turns to the Gegno, who seems almost dismissive, or at the very least trying to avoid eye contact with you. After a brief discussion of which you understood nothing, the Gegno walks off to the tan-colored ship. As if on cue, all of the other Gegno in the hangar return to their own respective ships.`
	"CN-11605" `	As you watch all of the ships leave, Adrauni speaks once more. "Eight revolutions you have been given by the Gegno to make an appearance on their world. If to this you do not comply, then you are, in their words, dismissed from their space."`
	"CN-11606" `	"Dismissed?"`
	"CN-11607" `	"Will you be coming with me?"`
	"CN-11608" `	"Alright, I will go."`
	"CN-11609" `	Adrauni thinks for a brief moment. "A more appropriate expression would be exiled, or perhaps shunned? Gegno culture is to hold all as a great home. Your presence in their space is to say you have already entered, though it is now an invitation you are no longer welcome to."`
	"CN-11610" `	"Aren't I already unwelcome?"`
	"CN-11611" `	"They can't decide where I go."`
	"CN-11612" `	"It is a difficult philosophy to explain. We Quarg were also subject to inhospitality. In some notable capacities we still are - however, it is of a different manner than this one."`
	"CN-11613" `	"Be that as it may, do not rushedly conflate such with unpunishable action. On their worlds is to their own conscientious discretion. However, what action you ultimately decide upon in their space is not without observation."`
	"CN-11614" `	"I shall not be. Indeed, it is regrettable that I can no longer be of assistance, but the fate of this matter belongs to only you and the Gegno."`
	"CN-11615" `	Adrauni stands up to its full height before you one last time. "To keep what little relations we have with the Gegno, I must inform you we no longer can allow access to our worlds here in their space. Despite this misfortune, I aspire for wise decisions from you in your journey ahead, <first> <last>." Adrauni gives you a lengthy bow and leaves the hangar, this likely being the last time you ever meet with it. It is now up to you to try and figure out some sort of common ground with the Gegno, if that's even still possible.`
	"CN-11616" `The Gegno display caution once more as fleets of both Vi and Scin ships orbit their homeworld while you begin your descent. Your Quarg "escort", which was already in the system before you, stays behind. A few smaller Gegno ships from each fleet follow you down to the planet's surface, forming up in front of you to lead you to your destination.`
	"CN-11617" `The Gegno display caution once more as fleets of both Vi and Scin ships orbit their homeworld while you begin your descent. A few smaller Gegno ships from each fleet follow you down to the planet's surface, forming up in front of you to lead you to your destination.`
	"CN-11618" `	Once you pass through several layers of smog, you're once again flying around the towering castle-like cities of the Gegno homeworld. Eventually, you are led away from the busyness of the cities to a more remote area with a massive structure shrouded by the smog, possibly the one you visited the first time you were here. The activity around it, however, seems much smaller compared to anything else thus far.`
	"CN-11619" `	Rather than one of the docking ports alongside the tower, the Gegno ships instead direct you to the base of the structure, obscured by another dark cloud of smog. When you reach the surface, the Gegno ships hold their position above while you park your ship on the ground. The area seems devoid of any other Gegno, almost hauntingly so.`
	"CN-11620" `	(Exit my ship.)`
	"CN-11621" `	You decide to remain in the safety of your ship. The Gegno hovering above you aren't helping anymore - they are simply watching you. Other than them, there are no other vehicles in the area, let alone any sort of ship. Before too long, you notice a shadowed figure in the smoke ahead, carrying a long staff of some sort. A lone Gegno exits the smoke cloud, takes a few more heavy steps, then stands their ground several meters away from your ship.`
	"CN-11622" `	Any action you take now would be solely at your own discretion. However, there is only one choice left for you to make.`
	"CN-11623" `	(Meet with the Gegno.)`
	"CN-11624" `	(Leave the Gegno and their world.)`
	"CN-11625" `	You decide to continue in your endeavor. You've made it this far, considering you're back on their homeworld and they haven't shown any signs of wanting you gone as of yet. The outside environment appears to be "safe" for humans - being something similar to the conditions on Earth, if Earth were even more polluted than it already is. Donning your sidearm in case of an emergency, you exit your ship and cautiously approach the Gegno. Although it's a little hard to tell, you're almost certain this is the Gegno you first met on that desert planet from before. The only difference in their appearance is some kind of red band on their left arm. The ships above suddenly fly off, and the Gegno turns around, beginning to head for the massive tower that stands in front of you.`
	"CN-11626" `	The outside environment appears to be "safe" for humans - being something similar to the conditions on Earth, if it were even more polluted than it already is. Donning your sidearm in case of an emergency, you exit your ship. The Gegno in the ships above intently watch your every move, and apart from the distant thrum of their engines, it is eerily quiet. Before too long, you notice a shadowed figure in the smoke ahead of your ship, carrying a long staff of some sort. A lone Gegno exits the smoke cloud, slowly approaching you. They stop a couple of meters away from you, and although it's a little hard to tell, you're almost certain this is the Gegno Vi that you first met on that desert planet from before. The only difference in their appearance is some kind of red band on their left arm.`
	"CN-11627" `	At this point, any action you take would be solely at your own discretion. However, there is only one choice left for you to make.`
	"CN-11628" `	You decide to continue in your endeavor. Considering you're back on their homeworld and they haven't shown any signs of wanting you off of it as of yet, there's no point to throwing all your progress away. As you approach the Gegno, it indeed seems to be the one you've met in the past. The ships above suddenly fly off, and the Gegno turns around, beginning to head for the massive tower that stands in front of you.`
	"CN-11629" `	The tower ahead of you is truly a sight to behold. It appears to be larger and taller than anything in human architecture, yet it looks very old - noticeably so - compared to the portions you've seen higher up in the clouds of dark smog. The base, which grows larger as the tower gets taller, is lined with rows of torch-like structures with flames reaching high above them. The interior is just as intriguing - the first area you enter looks like it almost came straight out of some old medieval fantasy. Everything looks rocky and sculpted in appearance, although some entrances seem to be made of newer metallic materials.`
	"CN-11630" `	You wonder if all Gegno architecture is built like this, but your curiosity is cut short when the Gegno, who has been many steps ahead of you, grunts and gestures for you to enter a cage-like platform at the other side of an enormous room.`
	"CN-11631" `	(Enter the cage.)`
	"CN-11632" `	Thankfully, the cage is not anything like a jail cell; with a clank of chains and other indeterminate sounds, you begin to ascend upwards to wherever your next destination may be. However, the shaking and clanging of the lift doesn't exactly ease your mind. All of a sudden, you start to hear a deep, methodical rumble coming from above you. In that same instant, you're hit with a gust of air. Your cage is outside the building, and it is rocketing upward with only the support of a few rails and pulleys. Surrounding the core of the tower in front of you are other large metal pulley systems, with the Gegno in one to your left in the distance. As you're ascending, you see that many Gegno are lined up on several balconies at different levels of the tower, playing large timpani-like drums in a steady rhythm. Occasionally they yell or play a horn-like instrument.`
	"CN-11633" `	A few more minutes of drumming, several layers of smog, and what feels like altitude sickness all assail you until the lift arrives at the very top of the tower - a huge, circular platform out in the open with a group of Gegno wearing various fashions of armor formed up around a large table, or display grid of sorts, with several models of planets and ships on top of it. A ring of electronic torches flanking each edge of the platform extends upward to the darkened sky.`
	"CN-11634" `	The Gegno that has guided you here gestures for you to go join them at their location among the others.`
	"CN-11635" `	(Go to the Gegno.)`
	"CN-11636" `	(Stay where I am.)`
	"CN-11637" `	It's not long before a pair of Gegno soldiers walk over and essentially "pressure" you into joining the others. You might as well play by their rules, given the situation.`
	"CN-11638" `	Once you reach the other Gegno, the drumming comes to an abrupt halt. Shown in the center of the display is some text, none of which you can understand. Three Gegno standing next to one another, separate from everyone else, begin speaking in low, booming voices; their language is incomprehensible. One is very bulky, and looks like the kind of Gegno that belong to the Vi faction, while the other two are smaller. All three of them are wearing the same set of intricate armor with fancy protrusions, drapes, and other details. All of the other Gegno present are of various builds, though none of them are wearing any colors indicating a faction. Some of them gaze toward you occasionally, while others pay you no attention at all.`
	"CN-11639" `	The awkwardness of the situation increases as several minutes pass, during which some Gegno from the crowd step up to the opposite side of the table from the trio and have a discussion. You look over to your Gegno guide standing next to you, their gaze locked on to the conversations ahead. One of the trio finally calls them over, placing a model of a desert planet on the table - the one where this all started. A heavy discussion follows, and while you watch your guide, you realize that they are the only Gegno with that red band on their arm. The other Gegno in the crowd don't seem very pleased as their discussion continues.`
	"CN-11640" `	Though it felt like it might not happen, the moment comes where the bulkiest of the trio directly gestures to you. The tension of the situation skyrockets as they say something in their language, then motion for you to stand across from them. All of the other Gegno are now staring you down, waiting, as your guide heads off to the side.`
	"CN-11641" `	(Approach the trio.)`
	"CN-11642" `	(Remain where I stand.)`
	"CN-11643" `	You choose not to do anything else, remaining where you stand. Anything you do would likely be held against you. Another few moments go by and the Gegno trio return to the table, beginning to discuss amongst themselves using the assorted objects on the table grid. Images and words are cycled through on the monitor, but you're too far away to see any of them. Several more minutes pass, and you feel like they've all but forgotten you as you start to tune out their discussion. Eventually, you're pulled back to reality; everything has gone silent yet again and one member of the Gegno trio calls to you to get your attention on the display.`
	"CN-11644" `	Any Gegno in your path march out of your way as you approach the center of the platform. You're in the spotlight now, and the silence is deafening. As soon as you stop at the trio, a few images of the <ship> in different contexts come up on the table's monitor, and one of the trio moves several planet miniatures which correspond to the ones you've visited in Gegno space. Following another brief moment of silence, one which seemingly everyone weathers with anticipation, one of the three addresses you in their language at a lower volume than they were speaking before.`
	"CN-11645" `	"Eyuu udyom Gegno tyysis. Udiyh tei arrtes ofor tei piyepuo?"`
	"CN-11646" `	"Are you asking me something about the Gegno?"`
	"CN-11647" `	"I would like to work something out with the Gegno."`
	"CN-11648" `	"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you are saying."`
	"CN-11649" `	The Gegno stares at you, then looks at the display, which is slowly panning between the situations you've found yourself in:`
	"CN-11650" `	A more detailed image of a desert planet, different than the first one, comes onto the display. Alongside it are many graphics - one representing a platoon of Vi warriors, the unique Gegno ship you saw there, and a few words scrolling by, possibly the names of each warrior that was present that day. Next to the name of the planet is a smaller graphic of one of those giant sandworms you fought, suggesting that they're found on other desert worlds beyond the first one.`
	"CN-11651" `	To the side of the table, you notice a model of the Mercury-like planet you landed on here in their home system, though strangely it doesn't come up on the screen at any point.`
	"CN-11652" `	An image of two distinct ships comes up, matching a pair of models on the table. One of them is the same type of Vi ship you first came across in the sand on a desert world, and the other is a Scin ship that looks like a derivative of other Gegno ships. You hear someone in the crowd yell loudly in what might be disappointment, but they are silenced by the Gegno trio.`
	"CN-11653" `	One of the more prominent situations is the one that involved a large battle between the Vi and Scin over a moon orbiting a forest world. A long list of phrases scrolls by with graphics of different Gegno ships next to them, probably those who took part in said battle. The Gegno around you murmur to each other, occasionally grunting.`
	"CN-11654" `	On the far end of the table, you see a small model of an ice moon. Nothing else comes up regarding it.`
	"CN-11655" `	You look up to see the trio of Gegno still intently staring at you. All of the other Gegno surrounding you have a similar expression. On the display, two icons appear side by side, and under each of them is a long list of phrases. As they scroll, the Gegno break out in discussions with one another, some loud and some not. You almost jump when the trio address the crowd and begin a speech of sorts, sometimes gesturing to the crowd, and sometimes gesturing to you. Although most of the Gegno seem frustrated, the trio is able to calm the crowd.`
	"CN-11656" `	The bulkiest Gegno of the trio then places a model of a massive Vi warship in the middle of the table, one that you definitely recognize. More angry outbursts come from the surrounding Gegno, and while the one who placed the model glares at you, the other two eventually deescalate the uproar.`
	"CN-11657" `	After having gone through all of the cases which involved you, the trio addresses the gathering once more with a big speech. Their voices echo through the outside air, and all of the Gegno respond with concurrent bellows or chants, followed by more silence. Oddly enough, you feel as if you are standing among them as part of the gathering, rather than as some foreign alien. You aren't restricted at all, even with a weapon on you.`
	"CN-11658" `	One of the smaller Gegno in the trio gestures back to you and speaks once more. You still don't understand a word they are saying, but it must have been important, as all of the other Gegno except your guide back away several steps. The trio member invites you with both arms to use the objects and the table, while all three of them back up themselves, leaving you alone in the open.`
	"CN-11659" `	(Approach the table and try to explain the incidents I was involved in.)`
	"CN-11660" `	(Stay where I am and do nothing.)`
	"CN-11661" `	You don't approach the table, standing awkwardly in the open. Maybe it's better to not say anything at all if you're what they perceive as the problem here. A whole minute of silence goes by, and all of the Gegno, including the trio, haven't said so much as a word. Instead, they silently judge the choice you've decided to make. The trio then march back to the table, moving all of the models aside as if they're setting up for something.`
	"CN-11662" `	Walking up to the table, you try your hardest to explain each situation one by one. Since you can't read or do anything with the actual display on the monitor, you try picking up the models, which nobody seems to be bothered by. At the same time, you gesture using your hands, mainly representing your ship flying "away". You wonder if anything makes any sense to the Gegno, but they don't seem to be paying attention to your words or actions themselves; rather, they seem to respond to the tone and emotion of them. After doing your best to describe everything, you back away from the table. The trio march back up to it, discussing your response amongst themselves. They then start moving all of the models aside as if they're setting up for something.`
	"CN-11663" `	Surprising both you and the other Gegno, an image of the planet Earth appears on the monitor. There's no way the Gegno have ever left the borders of their own territory, let alone visited human space. How they got this image is a mystery, but the fact is that an image of the ancestral homeworld of humanity is right in front of you. The member of the Gegno trio that has spoken the least then steps forward, but instead of heading to the table, they make their way to you directly.`
	"CN-11664" `	(Place my hand on my holster.)`
	"CN-11665" `	If the Gegno have an image of Earth, who knows what they know about you, or humanity in general? Slowly moving your hand to your holstered weapon, you prepare yourself for any possible aggression. Even though you do so, the Gegno doesn't hesitate or stop heading in your direction, although some in the crowd seem slightly concerned.`
	"CN-11666" `	Now standing not even two meters in front of you, the Gegno looks at you intently. An image of the world you're on right now slides over the one of Earth, and the Gegno points to it. "Gegno Dueyu Eitch echre, echre isend Gegno." The image shifts back to Earth, with the Gegno still pointing at the screen. "Eyuu dueyu nnepta, viehetch eyuu." The Gegno now motions toward the ground at your feet. "Viehetch eyuu ayyr Dueyu Eitch. Udiyh tei tsider?"`
	"CN-11667" `	(Don't say anything.)`
	"CN-11668" `	"...Dueyu Earth?"`
	"CN-11669" `	Without saying a word, you continue to look at the Gegno, and it continues to stare back, pondering your silence. They make a snorting sound with their nose, then leave you to join the other two behind them.`
	"CN-11670" `	The Gegno leans closer to your height and displays a peculiar expression - possibly one of disapproval. You panic a little, and some of the others seem surprised that they got this close to you. They then speak in a low rumble, somewhat like a whisper spoken aloud. "Eyuu idu keiou ghynem uf, 'Dueyu.'" Getting back up, the Gegno heads back to the other two behind them.`
	"CN-11671" `	With a sense of finality, the trio beckons to the crowd and begins another long speech. An image of a space station appears on the screen, and a large discussion begins between the other Gegno, whom have formed back up with each other. Some arguments between various Gegno in the audience start happening. Meanwhile, your Gegno guide bumps into you and starts to direct you away from the discussion, back to the cage lift with nobody else batting an eye.`
	"CN-11672" `	Several minutes later, you are escorted back to the base of the tower, which is now surrounded by a large group of Gegno civilians all gawking at the two of you. You're led back to your ship with your head spinning slightly, unsure what to make of that whole encounter. As they did the first time you were with them on the desert planet, the Gegno heads for your ship and hands you a small compass device, this time marking a different location on the map.`
	"CN-11673" `	At the very least, you can take this as an indication that they are not done with you yet, so you prepare to travel to your next destination.`
	"CN-11674" `	With a sense of finality, the trio beckons to the crowd and begins another long speech. When they are finished, the crowd goes silent. Your Gegno guide bumps into you and starts to direct you back to the cage lift while nobody else bats an eye. Several minutes later, you are escorted back to the base of the tower, still as barren as it was earlier. You're led back to your ship with your head spinning slightly, unsure what to make of that whole encounter. The Gegno remains at a distance from your ship as you prepare to depart.`
	"CN-11675" `	Before you leave, you watch as they lift their staff weapon and flip it around. An explosive cloud of smoke follows, and a sizable crater appears right beside the <ship>. It seems that you're no longer welcome here, although the fact that they intentionally missed such a large target might have other implications. Regardless, it could have been you on the other end of that blast at any point during this journey.`
	"CN-11676" `	Despite the aggressive action, you are not followed as you leave the planet.`
	"CN-11677" `	You ultimately decide that pursuing this ruse with the Gegno is no longer worth the effort. Even if you did end up in some sort of dialog with them, it would likely take an excessive amount of effort in order to get any amount of progress, assuming that is even possible. Perhaps even landing here was a mistake. You could never guess what might happen if you continued this endeavor, given you are all alone on the home world of a species that has shown itself to be rather xenophobic, even to the Quarg.`
	"CN-11678" `	As you prepare to depart, the Gegno, who was watching you all this time with a blank stare, lifts their staff weapon and flips it around. An explosive cloud of smoke follows, and a sizable crater appears right beside the <ship>. It seems they are, at the very least, unhappy with your decision to leave, which is a little odd considering they didn't want anything to do with you before. The fact that they intentionally missed such a large target, however, might have other implications. Regardless, it could have been you on the other end of that blast.`
	"CN-11679" `You arrive at your destination: a massive space station. Instead of standing directly behind you in your cockpit this time, the Gegno ended up taking a seat next to one of your open bunks, and didn't move a muscle up until now. Despite the grandiose nature of the Gegno's one and only space station, it seems very old and inactive. As you are escorted around the spacious interior, of which a majority is only a skeletal frame of pipes, bars, and supportive structures, you see a noticeable lack of personnel and running machinery. Some sections aren't even properly pressurized, but thankfully your spacesuit makes up for it. Occasionally, you come across some workers, but they appear very lethargic, or maybe just unmotivated.`
	"CN-11680" `	Eventually, you end up in a large docking bay where more workers and ships are present. Some of the workers are hauling crates of materials back and forth, with others talking among each other. The Gegno with you then motions over to a half-cracked display board on one of the walls across the room. With one last meaningful look, the Gegno leaves you to your own devices. You wonder if you'll ever see them again, considering the way they were treated back on Dueyu Eitch.`
	"CN-11681" `	(Go to the display.)`
	"CN-11682" `	(Try to communicate with the other Gegno around me.)`
	"CN-11683" `	You attempt to get the attention of some of the other Gegno present in the facility, but most of them give you strange glares or outright ignore you, until one seemingly annoyed Gegno gestures to the large cracked display.`
	"CN-11684" `	The display, although cracked and beaten up, still appears otherwise functional. It presents a series of graphics in a list that seems to be updating in real-time. On the left side of each graphic are various types of minable asteroids, and on the right are tally marks. It appears to be some sort of job list linked with the station, which implies that the Gegno are at least giving you a chance to "do your part", or perhaps make up for what you've done.`
	"CN-11685" `	(Accept one of the jobs.)`
	"CN-11686" `	(Leave without doing anything.)`
	"CN-11687" `	You fiddle with the screen, trying to decipher how to use it. Some of the Gegno gaze at you for doing so. While they silently judge, you manage to figure out that it's a touch-sensitive interface, though it takes a lot of force for you to get it to work.`
	"CN-11688" `	The first time you get the device to work, you see an image of a hematite asteroid, rich in iron, with five strange-looking tally marks next to it. Mining for them wasn't exactly the first thing you were expecting to do for the Gegno, but it is a start.`
	"CN-11689" `	You decide to leave the facility. None of the Gegno pay you any attention as you do, and are focused back on their work once more.`
	"CN-11690" `Despite previously leaving the station, you're given clearance to land again. Would you like to go to the job facility and try to accept one of the listings?`
	"CN-11691" `You dock with the station at the facility's port, rather than on the other side of it. Waiting for you is a large group of Gegno workers, all in rusted or damaged gear. After a few moments of staring and discussion among one another, they unload the minerals from your ship, then go about their business as if nothing happened. Another approaches you, and to your surprise, pays you a sum of <payment> for your work. It seems that the Gegno value and reward effort no matter who does it, even a member of another species.`
	"CN-11692" `	For the time being, the station remains accessible to you, as well as these small odd jobs for mining. Hopefully someday the Gegno will recognize that you're worth more than whatever they've labeled you for.`
	"CN-11693" `As you descend towards the surface of this seemingly uninhabited world, you activate your ship's radar system to scan the surface for anything of interest. While waiting for something to appear, you look up and catch a glimpse of a cloud of dust bursting from the ground far off to your right. Peering back down to your radar, you check the surface scans of that direction, but nothing appears. As you continue your flight, another sudden dust cloud appears several minutes later, but still nothing on the radar. You decide to keep your ship a few thousand meters above the surface and take the time to carefully look around, but there still doesn't seem to be anything of note besides the cracked rock formations and valleys of sand.`
	"CN-11694" `	Suddenly, your radar system picks up a larger signal on the horizon, and you see a bulky, rock-like structure. Once you get close enough, the structure begins to resemble a ship like ones you've seen flying around in the nearby systems, although it is half sunken into the sand.`
	"CN-11695" `	(Land near the ship and investigate.)`
	"CN-11696" `	(Continue to search the surface.)`
	"CN-11697" `	You carefully land your ship nearby, exiting your ship in an environment suit with your sidearm on hand and walk towards the alien spacecraft. The ship appears a bit larger than you thought - around the size of a Firebird. The dark-brown hull appears to be made from an unknown material, and has several metallic-looking parts both hatched in crevices and protruding outward. Oddly enough, the warship seems perfectly intact, but the way it is angled into the sand suggests that the ship has been there for some time. There doesn't seem to be any activity around it either. You decide to head back to your ship and take another look around the area.`
	"CN-11698" `	As you fly onward, an erratic signature on the surface appears on the edge of your radar. A large arch-like structure becomes visible in the distance, but disappears shortly after. You set your ship down close to the location and exit to investigate.`
	"CN-11699" `	As you fly onward, an erratic signature on the surface appears on the edge of your radar. A large arch-like structure becomes visible in the distance, but disappears shortly after. You set your ship down close to the location and exit to investigate, making sure to equip an environment suit and holster your sidearm.`
	"CN-11700" `	Much to your surprise, there is a large humanoid figure standing where the signature originated from. Your radar showed something much less defined than a humanoid, but standing in front of you is a large, bulky being cladded in what looks like a form of metallic armor, wielding a spear-like weapon. The figure moves around attentively as if it is focused on its surroundings, but appears to take no interest in your presence. The encounter feels very odd in that there is no immediate interaction or acknowledgment of your existence.`
	"CN-11701" `	(Approach the alien.)`
	"CN-11702" `	(Turn back to my ship.)`
	"CN-11703" `	Suddenly, the ground starts to vibrate intensely. You take out your sidearm in a panic, but as you look back up at the alien figure, you notice that they too enter a defensive stance - but not towards you. A large maw bursts open in the sand to your left, and out of it comes a massive creature hundreds of times your size, covered in spikes and scales. You barely have time to react as it plummets onto the sand to your right, but you get a glimpse of the alien creature riding the beast as they impale it with their weapon.`
	"CN-11704" `	(Leave the planet immediately.)`
	"CN-11705" `	(Distance myself from the site but continue to watch.)`
	"CN-11706" `	(Try to help the alien defeat the beast.)`
	"CN-11707" `	You aim your sidearm at the beast, preparing to fire. Instead of digging back under the surface, the beast continues to thrash about where it is while the alien batters it down with their spear weapon. Making sure you don't accidentally hit them, you hold your breath and wait until the right moment comes, aiming for the creature's head. The flailing creature begins to get closer, and your pulse begins to race. A gust of sand blasts directly towards you, and once it clears you fire your weapon. A shot flies directly into the face of the beast.`
	"CN-11708" `	Much to your dismay, the shot almost immediately ricochets off of it. You watch as the massive monster tumbles over you, just barely leaping into the air above. The monster plunges into the earth behind you, and you fall to your back with the wind knocked out of you. You raise your sidearm once more. The creature explodes out of the ground with its gaping mouth pointed upward to the sky. With shaking hands, you take aim once again and pull the trigger.`
	"CN-11709" `	A loud, cannon-like bang follows, but it most certainly did not come from your weapon. The beast before you falls downward in a cloud of black smoke, blasting sand and rubble everywhere with a thud. Once you come to your senses, you see the alien marching out of the creature's mouth.`
	"CN-11710" `	(Stand up and approach the alien.)`
	"CN-11711" `	(Get up and run to my ship.)`
	"CN-11712" `	Before you can collect yourself, you realize the alien is now much closer to you. Within a matter of moments, the alien stands before you, giving you a much better look at them. They are much taller than you, extremely bulky, and slightly hunched over. Heavy-looking metal surrounds their body, and in any exposed areas are rough-looking patches of skin and hair. Thick facial hair covers their face, and above their human-like eyes are a pair of horns curved inward towards you.`
	"CN-11713" `	Awkward silence ensues, and the alien looks you up and down in an unenthused way. They emit a very deep grumble, and with a loud snort, reach into a crevice in their armor to grab something. Pulling out what looks to be some sort of star map, they point to a location on it, gesture to themselves, then lower the device slowly to you. It seems they want to be taken to one of their species' planets.`
	"CN-11714" `	(Accept their request.)`
	"CN-11715" `	(Ask about their request.)`
	"CN-11716" `	(Reject their request.)`
	"CN-11717" `	You hesitantly take the device and turn to make your way to your ship. Before leaving, you take one last glimpse of the enormous creature in the background. Its head appears dragon-like, though with numerous eyes and a mane of spikes. A few small appendages sprout from its neck, giving it a scaly, salamander-like appearance. The various signatures on your radar earlier must have been others of their kind. The alien glares at you, then at the creature, before turning back to you once more to continue towards your ship.`
	"CN-11718" `	You try to ask the alien about the trip, but they simply give you a blank stare for a few seconds before shoving the star map into your chest, letting go of it. You reactively catch it, almost falling over yourself, and then take one last glance at the enormous creature in the background. Its head is very reptilian, close to dragon-like, with numerous eyes and a mane of spikes. A few small appendages are on either end of it, almost like a scaly salamander. Turning around, you see that the alien is already far ahead of you, and you rush after so they aren't first to your ship.`
	"CN-11719" `	You shake your head and decline the request of the alien after having dealt with everything that's happened. Turning back towards your ship to leave, you suddenly find yourself face-first in the ground, coughing up sand and dust, and hear the device hit the ground beside you. In frustration, you quickly get up and look for the alien, who is already marching towards your ship in the distance. Perhaps it wasn't the best idea to decline the request and turn your back on a being several times larger than you, who just took down a beast hundreds of times the size of them. You turn to look at the huge creature one last time. Its head is very reptilian, close to dragon-like, with numerous eyes and a mane of spikes. Definitely something more dangerous than you could ever be on foot.`
	"CN-11720" `	Cautiously retreating towards your ship, you keep your eyes and ears peeled for the creature, wondering if and where it might appear again. As if to answer your inquiry, the ground begins to rumble, and off to your left, sand and rubble erupt into the air as the beast twists and turns across the surface. Following a loud bellow, the creature screeches in short bursts, almost like chirps, except much deeper than that of a bird. As some of the dust clears, you see the alien figure breathing intensely as they continue to battle the beast.`
	"CN-11721" `	(Help the alien.)`
	"CN-11722" `	With the situation beginning to spin out of your control, you quickly turn around and make for your ship, taking off as soon as you can. You wonder what will become of the alien figure as while they are most certainly a member of the species inhabiting the nearby systems, it doesn't seem like any help will be sent for them anytime soon.`
	"CN-11723" `	Suddenly, your radar systems pick up a larger signal on the horizon, and you see a bulky, rock-like structure. Once you get close enough, you recognize it as one of the Gegno's warships, although it is half sunken into the sand.`
	"CN-11724" `	(Investigate the Gegno ship.)`
	"CN-11725" `	(Resume my search of the surface.)`
	"CN-11726" `	You carefully land your ship nearby. Most of the faint radar signatures from earlier have disappeared out of range. Exiting your ship in an environment suit and your sidearm on hand, you walk towards the Gegno ship.`
	"CN-11727" `	The ship appears a bit larger than you thought - around the size of a Firebird. The dark-brown hull appears to be made from an unknown material, and has several metallic-looking parts both hatched in crevices and protruding outward, indicative of the Gegno Vi's brutish aesthetics. Oddly enough, the warship seems perfectly intact, but the way it is angled into the sand suggests that the ship has been here for some time. There doesn't seem to be any activity around it, and you aren't picking up any nearby signs of life. You decide to head back to your ship and take another look around the area.`
	"CN-11728" `	As you fly onward, an erratic signature appears on the edge of your radar. A large arch-like structure becomes visible in the distance, but disappears shortly after. You set your ship down close where it originated from and exit to investigate, donning your environment suit with your sidearm at hand.`
	"CN-11729" `	Much to your surprise, there is a large humanoid figure standing in front of you. It looks nothing like the Gegno you've seen on the nearby Quarg ringworld; it is large, bulky, and clad in metallic armor. In one of its hands is a spear-like weapon; you guess that they are a Gegno Vi based on their appearance. The Vi moves around attentively, focused on its surroundings, but appears to take no interest in your presence.`
	"CN-11730" `	(Approach the Vi warrior.)`
	"CN-11731" `	Suddenly, the ground starts to vibrate intensely. You take out your sidearm in a panic, but as you look back up at the Vi, you notice that they too enter a defensive stance - but not towards you. A large maw bursts open in the sand to your left, and out of it comes a massive creature hundreds of times the size of you, covered in spikes and scales. You barely have time to react as it plummets onto the sand to your right, but you get a glimpse of the Vi riding the beast as they impale it with their weapon.`
	"CN-11732" `	(Observe the situation from a distance.)`
	"CN-11733" `	(Assist the Vi in defeating the beast.)`
	"CN-11734" `	You bring your sidearm up to a firing position and wait for the beast. Once again, it jumps out of the sand in an incredible display, but instead of digging back under the surface, the beast continues to thrash about where it is while the Vi batters it down with their spear weapon. Making sure you don't accidentally hit them, you hold your breath and wait until the right moment comes, aiming for the creature's head. The flailing creature begins to get closer, and your pulse begins to race. A gust of sand blasts directly towards you, and once it clears you fire your weapon. A shot flies directly into the face of the beast.`
	"CN-11735" `	A loud, cannon-like bang follows, but it most certainly did not come from your weapon. The beast before you falls downward in a cloud of black smoke, blasting sand and rubble everywhere with a thud. Once you come to your senses, you see the Vi marching out of the creature's mouth.`
	"CN-11736" `	Before you can collect yourself, you realize the Vi warrior is now much closer to you. Within a matter of moments, the alien stands before you, giving you a much better look at them. They are much taller than both you and the other Gegno you've seen, extremely bulky, and slightly hunched over. Heavy-looking metal surrounds their body, and in any exposed areas are rough-looking patches of skin and hair. Thick facial hair covers their face, and above their human-like eyes are a pair of horns curved inward towards you.`
	"CN-11737" `	While the Gegno are known to dislike outsiders, this particular Gegno seems to at the very least acknowledge you. After a period of awkward and what seems to be judgmental silence, the Vi looks you up and down in an unenthused manner. They emit a very deep grumble, and with a loud snort, reach into a crevice in their armor to grab something. Pulling out what looks to be some sort of star map, they point to a location on it, gesture to themselves, then lower the device slowly to you. It seems they want to be taken to one of the Gegno's planets.`
	"CN-11738" `	You hesitantly take the device and turn to make your way to your ship. Before leaving, you take one last glimpse of the enormous creature in the background. Its head appears dragon-like, though with numerous eyes and a mane of spikes. A few small appendages sprout from its neck, giving it a scaly, salamander-like appearance. The various signatures on your radar earlier must have been others of their kind. The Vi warrior glares at you, then at the creature, before turning back to you once more to continue towards your ship.`
	"CN-11739" `	You try to ask the Gegno about the trip, but they simply give you a blank stare for a few seconds before shoving the star map into your chest, letting go of it. You reactively catch it, almost falling over yourself, and then take one last glance at the enormous creature in the background. Its head is very reptilian, close to dragon-like, with numerous eyes and a mane of spikes. A few small appendages are on either end of it, almost like a scaly salamander. Turning around, you see that the Gegno is already far ahead of you, and you rush after so they aren't first to your ship.`
	"CN-11740" `	You shake your head and decline the request of the Gegno after having dealt with everything that's happened. Turning back towards your ship to leave, you suddenly find yourself face-first in the ground, coughing up sand and dust, and hear the device hit the ground beside you. In frustration, you quickly get up and look for the Gegno, who is already marching towards your ship in the distance. Perhaps it wasn't the best idea to decline the request and turn your back on a being several times larger than you who just took down a beast hundreds of times the size of them. You turn to look at the huge creature one last time. Its head is very reptilian, close to dragon-like, with numerous eyes and a mane of spikes. Definitely something more dangerous than you could ever be on foot.`
	"CN-11741" `	Cautiously retreating to a safer distance, you keep your eyes and ears peeled for the creature, wondering if and where it might appear again. As if to answer your inquiry, the ground begins to rumble, and off to your left, sand and rubble erupt into the air as the beast twists and turns across the surface. Following a loud bellow, the creature screeches in short bursts, almost like chirps, except much deeper than that of a bird. As some of the dust clears, you see the Vi breathing intensely as they continue to battle the beast.`
	"CN-11742" `	(Assist the Vi.)`
	"CN-11743" `You find yourself approaching this desert world once again, wondering what happened to the alien figure you previously encountered. Knowing the world is home to a dangerous indigenous species, you are hesitant on landing, making sure to stay clear of any signs of creatures like the one from before.`
	"CN-11744" `	(Go search for the alien.)`
	"CN-11745" `	(Carry on.)`
	"CN-11746" `	With the coordinates of the alien vessel still in the history of your ship's computer, you set off to find it again. On your flight there, your radar suddenly picks up another ship approaching, and you look up to see the same type of ship you saw before flying at a higher altitude over you in the opposite direction. It must be another pilot belonging to the alien species.`
	"CN-11747" `	(Attempt to contact the ship.)`
	"CN-11748" `	(Evade the ship.)`
	"CN-11749" `	The ship continues to fly off behind you until it disappears. It seems that whoever is piloting it isn't concerned with helping the alien on the surface. Eventually, the familiar sunken vessel appears on the horizon and you begin to fly around the area in search for signs of life, hoping that the alien is still alive. Nothing comes up besides the faint blips of the sand creatures at the edges of your radar and you decide to follow them instead.`
	"CN-11750" `	The signals keep randomly disappearing and reappearing elsewhere, and appear to lead to only empty space. After checking a few of them, an erratic movement appears on the edge of your radar, similar to the one during your first visit. Approaching the location, you recognize the beast that is swinging about on the surface, and catch glimpses of the alien from before continuing to fight it.`
	"CN-11751" `	(Assist the alien in defeating the creature.)`
	"CN-11752" `Despite knowing you are transporting one of them, you made the conscious decision to fire upon <alien> ships, and the rest of your trip to this world was extremely awkward. Rather than settle in a bunk, the <alien> passenger stood close behind you in your cockpit the entire time. You occasionally turned to observe their behavior and even made attempts to communicate, but they wouldn't so much as look in your direction.`
	"CN-11753" `	Strangely, they didn't seem to be upset at all, at least in a way you could tell. Regardless, the tension became extremely uncomfortable, but now that you've landed your ship, perhaps you could address it.`
	"CN-11754" `	(Try to communicate with the <alien>.)`
	"CN-11755" `	Before you could turn to speak to them, you feel an immense force go straight through your torso, and your body slowly starts to lift up. You try to speak, but nothing comes out, and struggling your head, you turn to see that the <alien> has pierced you through your chest with their spear weapon. As your vision slowly fades, the last glimpse you could see of them wasn't a look of hatred, but one of disappointment.`
	"CN-11756" `Your trip here was full of tension and anything but pleasant. Rather than find a seat normally, the <alien> stood close behind you in your cockpit with their arms crossed during most of the ride, almost as if they were an immovable boulder. Occasionally, you made attempts to communicate with them again to break the pressure, but the most they would give you is a slight glance or low grunt.`
	"CN-11757" `	As you descend into the atmosphere, you watch as layers of dark smog quickly reveal massive cities glittered with various lights towering into the sky. The ships here are of different shades than the ones you previously saw, being more tan than dark brown, and are in a much larger quantity. The intensity of traffic, combined with the overwhelming mass of infrastructure, suggests that this is the homeworld of the <alien>. Before getting lost in the fantastical sight in front of you, the <alien> marches up next to you and raises one arm, gesturing to an enormous factory-like structure in the distance that stands out from other towers. You carefully guide your ship to the building and with the help of the <alien> find a suitable docking port to land on.`
	"CN-11758" `	After you touch down, several <aliens> that are of a similar appearance to the one next to you begin to line up in a formation towards your ship, all carrying various types of staff-like weaponry. However, they don't show any signs of aggression and simply hold their position in a coordinated display of might. The <alien> beside you gestures for their compass device they gave you earlier.`
	"CN-11759" `	(Hand them the device.)`
	"CN-11760" `	After fiddling with it, the <alien> marks a new location and presents it to you. "Oukeug," they say, and gesture you to depart in a fashion of urgency. They then leave your ship, walk towards the others, and have a brief discussion. A few moments later, another smaller group of <aliens> arrive with what looks to be some type of fueling device, and after a minute or so of fidgeting with it, they manage to hook it up to your ship. These <aliens> look shorter and thinner than the others, and wear more leather-like garments than heavy metal ones - but their demeanor is just as rigid. Once your ship's fuel has been filled, the <alien> that has been guiding you gestures towards the sky. It seems your visit to the mysterious <alien> homeworld will have to be cut short.`
	"CN-11761" `	After fiddling with it, the Vi marks a new location and presents it to you. "Oukeug," they say, and gesture you to depart in a fashion of urgency. You look at the location and notice that it's the Quarg ringworld you've previously visited. They then leave your ship, walk towards the others, and have a brief discussion. A few moments later, another smaller group of Gegno arrive with what looks to be some type of fueling device, and after a minute or so of fidgeting with it, they manage to hook it up to your ship. These Gegno look shorter and thinner than the others, and wear more leather-like garments than heavy metal ones - but their demeanor is just as rigid. Once your ship's fuel has been filled, the Gegno Vi that has been guiding you gestures towards the sky. It seems your visit to the mysterious Gegno homeworld will have to be cut short.`
	"CN-11762" `	After fiddling with it, the <alien> marks a new location and presents it to you. "Oukeug," they say, and gesture you to depart in a fashion of urgency. You look at the location and realize that it's the nearby Quarg ringworld. Considering your history with the Quarg, they likely won't be welcoming you with open arms, to say the least. The <alien> abruptly jabs you with their elbow, motioning you once more to take off.`
	"CN-11763" `	You begin preparing your ship for departure, and the <alien> leaves your ship. They walk towards the others, have a brief discussion, and another smaller group of <aliens> arrive with what looks to be some type of fueling device. After a minute or so of fidgeting with it, they manage to hook it up to your ship. These <aliens> look shorter and thinner than the others, and wear more leather-like garments than heavy metal ones - but their demeanor is just as rigid. Once your ship's fuel has been filled, the <alien> that has been guiding you points towards the sky. Visiting the Quarg isn't an option, so it seems associating with these <aliens> is unlikely for the foreseeable future.`
	"CN-11764" `As soon as you enter the system, your eyes are greeted with a familiar sight - a Quarg Ringworld. Shortly after, the Quarg open a communications channel with you. "Your welcome is not desired here, aggressor. What purpose do you seek, if not that of violence?"`
	"CN-11765" `	"The aliens on a nearby world sent me to you."`
	"CN-11766" `	"I would like help in conversing with the nearby aliens."`
	"CN-11767" `	The Quarg are quick to respond. "You will find no such help in us. It would be of best interest to not affiliate yourself with these aliens, whom call themselves the Gegno. It is not us, so much as it is the Gegno, that do not desire contact. Little would you understand how impactful your actions may be with ether the Vi or Scin, let alone ones of violence." A slight pause ensues. "Now, begone from our system. We shall be watching."`
	"CN-11768" `	Without the Quarg's help, interaction with these so-called "Gegno" seems unlikely for the foreseeable future.`
	"CN-11769" `	After an extensive moment of silence, the Quarg respond. "We have no interest in aiding an instigator. The aliens you speak of, Gegno as they are called, are a fragile species. They themselves do not desire contact, as their attention is had on the great deal of internal struggle between the Scin and Vi. In such a case, the Gegno would gain nothing in relations with interstellar warmongers, and you are strongly cautioned to avoid affiliation with them. Now, begone from our system. We shall be watching."`
	"CN-11770" `	The mood here is eerie as the Quarg here move in an unusually quiet manner. They are dismissive of the other species walking about, who are equally as dismissive of you. The strange atmosphere around you is finally broken when a few Quarg start to advance towards you, moving much quicker than the rest. After some unidentifiable discussion and gestures between themselves, one of them motions you to follow them.`
	"CN-11771" `The visual of a complete Quarg Ringworld is drastically different than the alien homeworld you were on before. Such a pristine, advanced structure is quite the opposite of a disorderly industrial civilization. The population of Quarg here must be at least around the trillions, many times more than the population of the alien homeworld. What's even more interesting is there are other aliens of the kind you met before here on the ring too. The Quarg must have some kind of relations with them, perhaps through trade, maintenance, or other services. Despite them being present, the Quarg seem to be very dismissive of them. However, a few of the aliens occasionally glance over at you with hints of interest.`
	"CN-11772" `	Soon enough, a few Quarg start to rush towards you much faster than the others and begin a conversation between themselves. You aren't sure what language they are speaking, but judging by the tones and pronunciations, it sounds similar to the one you've heard the aliens speaking before. After a moment or so, one of them motions you to follow them.`
	"CN-11773" `	You walk with the Quarg, occasionally having trouble keeping pace with their silent yet brisk steps, as you head towards an area that appears devoid of the other aliens. Eventually, you are led to a smaller room with two more Quarg in waiting, silently sitting at the end of it. They talk, but this time you can hear a few familiar sounding terms, one being "Huema." Despite speaking to each other for several minutes, the Quarg still look at each other in what you assume is something like bewilderment.`
	"CN-11774" `	One of the Quarg waiting in the room finally turns towards you and motions you to take a seat. Its look of confusion disappears when they turn their gaze back upon you. Meanwhile, the other Quarg that was seated has left the room, along with the ones that first brought you here.`
	"CN-11775" `	"Is there a problem?"`
	"CN-11776" `	The Quarg continues to look at you and bows its head slightly in an apologetic manner, as it seems neither it, nor any other Quarg on this ringworld, can speak your language. You continue to patiently wait in the uneasy silence, withholding your curiosities as almost half an hour goes by.`
	"CN-11777" `	Finally, the silence is broken when the second Quarg from earlier enters the room again. This time, it glares at you much more energetically, and you begin to wonder if your presence really is an issue.`
	"CN-11778" `	You preemptively begin to stand up, but you are cut short when you see the second Quarg raise its arms outward in a gesture you never thought you'd see from a Quarg. "This must be for you an exhilarating day, young traverser. I strongly imagine this is a first for both of us." It is now obvious that this Quarg is not the same one from earlier, and you begin to see a few differences in its attire and figure. The upbeat rhythm to their speech is not something you would expect of a Quarg.`
	"CN-11779" `	"Where am I?"`
	"CN-11780" `	The Quarg sits down across from you, still gesturing its arms about in a strange manner, albeit slower this time. "You have found yourself in the dwelling of the mighty Gegno, who have rooted their hardy empire here in the great galactic east."`
	"CN-11781" `	"You have astonishingly achieved a wondrous feat, brave traverser," the Quarg says, placing its hands together. It seems that the Quarg are already aware of your encounter on the alien homeworld. In fact, thinking back to it, the looks of interest earlier by other aliens suggests that the word got spread quickly. It then sits down across from you, then raises its arms outward in a gesture you never thought you'd see from a Quarg. "Not significantly often it is that the mighty Gegno interact with daring outsiders."`
	"CN-11782" `	"The Gegno?"`
	"CN-11783" `	"Do the ships I've seen around belong to these Gegno?"`
	"CN-11784" `	"Yes, the imperious Gegno. A juvenile race, they are, many decades younger than that of you humans. They do not find themselves in the struggle of leadership the same way as others do. Rather, they glorify their pursuit of guidance between one another to share a noble future." You wonder if the Quarg's use of boastful adjectives is because of gaps in its translations, or if it is intentionally speaking that way. Its voice still comes from the lower tones of Quarg speech, clashing with the excited pace it is speaking at.`
	"CN-11785" `	"What is this guidance they pursue?"`
	"CN-11786" `	"Indeed, the vessels of such stature represent the robust Gegno. Not in sorrow, but greatness do they pursue their future, bearing the fruit of sacrifice as a trophy to their name."`
	"CN-11787" `	"Sacrifice?"`
	"CN-11788" `	"The Gegno believe it necessary to pursue what they choose must be, in order to imagine a grand future for themselves. Thus, they have separated into two different branches. One brandishes themselves as the honorable Vi - mightiest of warriors, toughest of kin. They are brutes that see proof of strength being the one and only variable in determining their path. That of the Scin, the more technologically able, believe that only through progression of sciences and discovery will the Gegno prosper."`
	"CN-11789" `	"The Gegno believe it necessary to overwhelmingly sacrifice whatever must be, in order to imagine a future for themselves. Thus, they have separated into two different branches. One brandishes themselves as the honorable Vi - mightiest of warriors, toughest of kin. They are brutes that see proof of strength being the one and only variable in determining their path. That of the Scin, the more technologically able, believe that only through progression of sciences and discovery will the Gegno prosper."`
	"CN-11790" `	"The Vi are right, the strength to survive is more important than anything else."`
	"CN-11791" `	"The Scin are right, technological advancement opens up so many possibilities."`
	"CN-11792" `	"Why do they not combine their efforts to better their future together?"`
	"CN-11793" `	"While it is characteristic, such a tremendous proposition is rather dull for a marvelously growing species. Be that as it may, you humans follow this harsh doctrine, though to a much lesser degree than that of the Vi."`
	"CN-11794" `	"The pursuit of technology leaves behind many values important to a glorious species' growth, that of which we have seen plentifully."`
	"CN-11795" `	"Regrettably, most Gegno do not have a drive to pursue their principal future, diluting themselves far into their stagnant present. Segregation of followings was one of few ways to seek motivation beyond the fact."`
	"CN-11796" `	"Thank you for the information."`
	"CN-11797" `	"It seems that you do not like the paths they've chosen."`
	"CN-11798" `	The Quarg stands up, but as it does so, you watch as a few marks on its otherwise gray skin shift into blue hues with faint traces of purple, though they fade away shortly after. "It is not in our prosperous grasp to persuade the Gegno, as once we did attempt to. They threaten conflict with us should we interfere, and we have no desire to witness an imperiled uprising of such a sort once more." It pauses for an extended time, then gestures you to stand up as well.`
	"CN-11799" `	"Similarly, the Gegno do not wish to interact with audacious outsiders. Unfortunately, only a brief history of them we can tell. We cannot advocate virtuous pleasantries between you and them, though you are welcome at this ring should you find yourself here again. Please keep encounters with the Gegno minimal."`
	"CN-11800" `	"However, it is still quite staggering that the Gegno interacted with an audacious outsider such as yourself." The Quarg pauses again for a moment and takes a longer breath than usual. "Please do be distinctly cautious in encounters with the Gegno. Unfortunately, we cannot advocate virtuous pleasantries between you and them. Only a brief history of them can we tell. Although, you are appreciably welcome at this ring should you find yourself here again."`
	"CN-11801" `	The Quarg motions a bow to you, and the first one from earlier escorts you out of the room. It seems associating with these so-called "Gegno" is very unlikely for you, and you will have to deal with their xenophobia for the foreseeable future.`
	"CN-11802" `As soon as you land on this Quarg world, a few Quarg swiftly make their way to your ship. One of them stands in front of the rest and beckons you over while the others quietly speak to themselves in a language you've not heard before. The Quarg bows down slightly to speak to you, and judging by the look in its eyes, they seem rather perplexed. "Sdii veebyi keies Gegnion?" it asks, which seems to be the language the others were speaking in. Afterwards, it patiently waits for your response.`
	"CN-11803" `	(Try to speak to the Quarg.)`
	"CN-11804" `	You introduce yourself to the Quarg and then explain that you don't understand their language. It lifts itself back up slowly, seemingly pondering the situation before turning back to the others. After a few more exchanged words, one of the other Quarg walk off and fetch some sort of device, bringing it back to you. It appears to be some type of holographic map. The Quarg gestures to a system nearby, which then reveals a hologram of a Quarg Ringworld. "Ehsveet Duebyuarr Giaru, Aechman," it says, and then bows before you.`
	"CN-11805" `	You should probably go pay the ringworld a visit.`
	"CN-11806" `You arrive once more at Giaru Gegno, hoping to find another Quarg that speaks your language. This time, however, you notice that a few of the Gegno on this ringworld occasionally give you a look of interest as they walk by. After about a minute of this a pair of Quarg approach you, motioning you to follow them. Led back to the familiar room from before, the Quarg you previously spoke with is already calmly sitting at the other end of the table.`
	"CN-11807" `	"You have astonishingly achieved a wondrous feat, brave traverser," the Quarg says, placing its hands together. It seems the Quarg are already aware of your encounter on the alien homeworld. In fact, thinking back to it, the looks of interest you received earlier suggests that the word spread quickly. "Not significantly often it is the mighty Gegno interact with daring outsiders."`
	"CN-11808" `	"It was a coincidence."`
	"CN-11809" `	"They seemed in trouble when I found them, so I helped them."`
	"CN-11810" `	"Indeed yes, strange coincidences do curiously happen. Many coincidences are as mere fleeting moments of subtle peculiarity." The Quarg then displays a soft grimace. "Sometimes, one may be grand and powerful, in addition to having potent consequences. The Gegno have learned this a great number of times.`
	"CN-11811" `	"Quite a brave one you indeed are. Most would think to not leap into the daunting face of uncertainty as you have." The Quarg momentarily meditates on its next thought. "Though, as the Gegno have throughout their history, some may make momentous jumps undeterred by any amount of hesitance."`
	"CN-11812" `	The Quarg raises from its seat, and you act in accordance. "Please do be distinctly cautious in your encounters with the Gegno. Always feel gracious to visit here once more, should you mindfully chose to do so." As you are directed out of the room, you turn back to see the Quarg bowing. You can't help but wonder what was on its mind during the conversation, but it might be for the best you are more careful from now on.`
	"CN-11813" `As you're traveling through Gegno space, a faint signal starts emanating from somewhere in your ship. You aren't sure what it is, as it doesn't appear to originate from the ship itself, so you decide to take a look. After a few minutes of searching for the culprit, you come across a device not too dissimilar from the one that the Gegno you met on Var Oti had given you, arbitrarily shoved into some corner of your ship's infrastructure. You don't know how or when it got there, but at least it wasn't something more dangerous like an explosive.`
	"CN-11814" `	Once you retrieve the device, you notice that along with the signal it's emitting, there is some sort of map display that has several locations in the region marked in some way or another, along with various scribblings in a language you can't understand. Although it's hard to make sense of what any of it means, one particular planet displayed has several graphics around it, much more extravagant than the rest. Perhaps finding this planet will shed some light on this strange situation.`
	"CN-11815" `The signal coming from the mysterious device is weak. You must be getting farther away from the location marked on the device.`
	"CN-11816" `The signal coming from the mysterious device is becoming stronger now. You seem to be getting closer to the location marked on the device.`
	"CN-11817" `Once you enter the system, the mysterious device suddenly makes a loud noise and shuts off. You aren't sure if that means you've found your destination, or if this whole situation was just a ruse. Either way, the only way to find out is to land on the planet and see if anything is there.`
	"CN-11818" `You make your descent to the surface of this world, going through several thick layers of clouds. Once you break though them and prepare to land, you notice what appear to be a few Gegno Scin ships grounded nearby, easily distinguished by their various green color patterns. Two of them look like military vessels you've seen in nearby systems, while a third one between them is a small shuttlecraft. It's almost as if they were expecting you, as before you continue further, one of the warships begins to lift off the ground and head in your direction.`
	"CN-11819" `	(Leave the planet.)`
	"CN-11820" `	(Wait and see what they do.)`
	"CN-11821" `	(Prepare for combat.)`
	"CN-11822" `	Engaging your weapon systems, you brace yourself for a hostile encounter as they approach. The Scin ship advances towards yours then slowly comes to a halt in front of you. They haven't fired any weapons, and they aren't displaying any aggressive behavior, so they might not be looking for conflict. Ever so slightly, the warship reverses backwards and comes to a stop. You decide to stop your ship as well, and you wonder what this is about. Once again, the Scin ship reverses, slowly drifting away from you. It appears they want you to follow them.`
	"CN-11823" `	Bringing your ship to a halt, you decide to wait and see what the Scin ship does as it advances towards you. As it slowly approaches, it slows down and eventually stops for a brief moment. Ever so slightly, the warship then begins to reverse backwards, and continues to drift away from you while facing you. They don't seem to be cautious of you, rather, it's almost as if they're implying to follow them.`
	"CN-11824" `	(Follow them.)`
	"CN-11825" `	Wary of the Scin warship, you turn around and begin to ascend back into space. The Scin ship advances towards yours, but as it comes closer, it begins to take on an escort formation with you, following you as you leave the planet's atmosphere. Once you finally make it back into space, the Scin ship breaks from formation and flies away. You're unsure of what they're doing on the planet or why you've been lead to them, but it's probably better for you to be careful and not get involved.`
	"CN-11826" `	You inch your ship forward in acknowledgment. All of a sudden, the second warship on the ground lifts off and forms up behind you, while the one in front of you turns around and begins to fly off into the distance. You follow them, curious where they might be leading you. To your rear, the remaining shuttle takes off, but instead of following you, it heads off into the atmosphere above.`
	"CN-11827" `	Although this planet initially appeared dull due to the several layers of thick clouds, the surface shows occasional signs of life such as plains of grass or dried-up riverbeds, while patches of low fog cover various other locations. As the flight continues, the two Scin ships slowly start to move around so that one is on either side of you. Up ahead in the distance, a large structure comes into view from behind another wall of fog. After getting a bit closer to it, you make out the familiar green colors of the ships flying with you now. The two warships begin to descend towards what you assume to be a sizable Scin freighter sitting in a large open area of sand.`
	"CN-11828" `	Your previous encounter with a Vi warrior was chaotic and unpredictable, so it might be best to be extra cautious in this situation. As you set your ship down near the vessel, the two warships that guided you here also land nearby and power down. Other than the Gegno ships in front of you, there doesn't seem to be any strange activity on your radar at the moment. Environmental readings of the outside surprisingly indicate conditions safe for a human, but it's better to be safe than sorry. You equip your environment suit and your pistol just in case.`
	"CN-11829" `	(Approach the Scin.)`
	"CN-11830" `	(Stay by my ship.)`
	"CN-11831" `	You take one or two steps forward but remain close by your ship, staying alert. The freighter is indeed large - maybe four times the size of a Hauler, or almost twice the size of a Behemoth. An elevator lowers from its undercarriage, and a group of Scin exit the ship, making their way towards you. Their attire is much different than that of the Vi; most of them are wearing what looks like segmented armor with many layers of plates, giving the appearance of scales. One of them, however, has a much lighter armor set focused mainly around their shoulders, with orange robe-like garments underneath. They are slightly thinner than the other Scin. Although they are nowhere near as bulky as the Vi, they all still appear taller than any human. More importantly, they seem far more eager to interact with you, seeing as they left the comfort of their own ship to greet you.`
	"CN-11832" `	Stopping about four meters from you, the Scin in heavier armor drop to the ground on one knee. The one wearing a robe takes a few more steps, then sits on the ground in front you, crossing their legs.`
	"CN-11833" `	(Reach for my pistol.)`
	"CN-11834" `	You sit down, taking a good look at them. Their skin appears almost bone-like with very faint patterns of light green. Unlike the Vi, they have three small horns and barely any hair at all. They seem just as interested in your appearance, looking you up and down. Another Scin from the freighter walks over, bringing some sort of device and kneeling down next to the robed one, who takes the device and sets it down between you and them. It looks like some sort of tablet or drawing implement.`
	"CN-11835" `	The Scin then reaches their palm out and makes a mark on one half of the display, then turns it to you.`
	"CN-11836" `	(Place my hand on the device.)`
	"CN-11837" `	Placing your own palm on the device, you feel it vibrate a little. A detailed wireframe of your hand appears on the other half of the device. The Scin moves the device aside, then extends one arm out showing the top of their hand.`
	"CN-11838" `	(Extend my arm as well.)`
	"CN-11839" `	Reaching with your right hand, the Scin leans forward and carefully examines it, then makes another note on their device. After writing down a few more things, they get up from the ground and gesture strangely towards you, crossing their arms together to form a plus sign toward their left. The other heavier-armored Scin rise from their stances and begin heading back to their ships, and the one in front of you follows behind them.`
	"CN-11840" `	You return to your own ship after the bewildering encounter, wondering what to make of it, and the Scin do not follow you any further.`
	"CN-11841" `	Turning the device back around, the Scin types some sort of note on it then clears the display. They then begin to draw some sort of picture with one of their fingers. The finished image appears to be a portrait of themselves. "Dueyu Scin," they speak in a low tone. Clearing the image, they draw something that looks like you, albeit a bit out of proportion, then await some sort of answer.`
	"CN-11842" `	"Dueyu human..?"`
	"CN-11843" `	"I am human."`
	"CN-11844" `	The Scin looks at you in what you guess to be fascination. They grab the device and draw yet another picture. After setting it down, you recognize the familiar image of a Gegno Vi warrior.`
	"CN-11845" `	"Gegno Vi?"`
	"CN-11846" `	"Dueyu Vi?"`
	"CN-11847" `	Looking at you with a confused expression, they draw another portrait that looks like the shorter leather-wearing Gegno from their homeworld, and move that image together with the images of the Vi and the Scin. "Gegno," they say, and begin to think to themselves. A brief moment passes, and they begin drawing on the device again. After they turn it back to you, you see both a green-colored patch and a brown-colored patch. "Vi," the Scin says, pointing to the brown. "Scin," they say, now pointing to the green. Afterwards, they point to the group of the three Gegno portraits. "Gegno."`
	"CN-11848" `	Once they mark down a few more notes, they get up from the ground and begin heading back to their ships. The heavier-armored Scin also rise from their stances and follow behind them.`
	"CN-11849" `	All of a sudden, a gust of sand rushes past from behind you, and you turn around to see three more armored Scin rising from the sand, one of them fairly close to you. Their armor is much different than that of the others, characterized by darker shades, sharper edges, and several gadgets, but what is most notable is their possession of sickle-like blade weapons. It appears the Scin had more control of the situation than you thought, and had you made the wrong choice in the encounter, it's possible you would be on the receiving end of one of those blades.`
	"CN-11850" `	You return to your ship and take off from the planet, but the Scin do not follow you any further.`
	"CN-11851" `	They stare at you for a few seconds, then retrieve their device. The Scin sits up more rigidly, giving you a deep look, then tilts their head to the right, followed by an awkward silence.`
	"CN-11852" `	(Tilt my head to the right as well.)`
	"CN-11853" `	(Tilt my head to the left.)`
	"CN-11854" `	Once you tilt your head, they note down your behavior on the device. Subsequently, they get up from the ground and begin heading back to their ships. The heavier-armored Scin also rise from their stances and follow behind them.`
	"CN-11855" `	The Scin stares at you for an uncomfortable length of time, then sighs. They reach into their armor and pull out a small firearm, raising it at you.`
	"CN-11856" `	(Reach for my firearm.)`
	"CN-11857" `	(Raise my arms.)`
	"CN-11858" `As soon as you attempt to move, the first thing you feel is a curved blade around your neck and a wave of sand flying past you. The Scin casually marks another note on their device, then gets up and starts heading back to their ship. Slowly turning your head, your eyes are met with the cold, expressionless look of another Scin's face, who then motions for you to return to your ship. They follow you as you do, continuing to hold the blade to your throat. Two more Scin suddenly appear from the sand along the way, while the others you first met remain at their position. The armor of the Scin escorting you is considerably different from the rest, characterized by darker shades, sharper edges, and several gadgets.`
	"CN-11859" `	Once you are at your ship, they move their blade away from your neck. When you get a better look at it, you realize that the blade is shaped like a sickle as opposed to a sword, meaning there was little chance you could have avoided being decapitated if they chose to use it. You board your ship in a hurry, preparing to take off. It's clear you've overstayed your welcome.`
	"CN-11860" `	It is rather alarming that the Scin are comfortable in approaching you casually, and considering how the encounter with the Vi went, anything could happen next. You decide to reach for your pistol, but as soon as you do, the first thing you feel is a curved blade around your neck and a wave of sand flying past you. Slowly turning your head, your eyes are met with the cold, expressionless look of another Scin's face, who then motions for you to return to your ship. They follow you as you do, continuing to hold the blade to your throat. Two more Scin suddenly appear from the sand along the way, while the others you first met remain at their position. The armor of the Scin escorting you is considerably different from the rest, characterized by darker shades, sharper edges, and several gadgets.`
	"CN-11861" `	Once you are at your ship, they move their blade away from your neck. When you get a better look at it, you realize that the blade is shaped like a sickle as opposed to a sword, meaning there was little chance you could have avoided being decapitated if they chose to use it. Boarding your ship in a hurry, you prepare to take off, and you notice the two Scin warships also begin to power up. It's clear you've overstayed your welcome.`
	"CN-11862" `	Walking towards the Scin, you notice the freighter is indeed large - maybe four times the size of a Hauler, or almost two times the size of a Behemoth. As you approach it, an elevator lowers from its undercarriage, and a group of Scin await your arrival. Their attire is much different than that of the Vi; most of them wear what looks like segmented armor with many layers of plates, giving off the appearance of scales. One of them, however, has a much lighter armor set focused mainly around their shoulders, with orange robe-like garments underneath. They are slightly thinner than the other Scin. Although none of them are anywhere near as bulky as the Vi, they all still appear slightly taller than any human. More importantly, they seem far more eager to interact with you, seeing as they are comfortable with you being near their ship.`
	"CN-11863" `	Once you're at the elevator, the Scin in heavier armor escort you onboard. The elevator lifts back into the ship, leading into some sort of spacious internal bay. The Scin in the robe walks off nearby and grabs some sort of device, moving it over to where you stand, and gestures for you to join them.`
	"CN-11864" `	(Join them.)`
	"CN-11865" `	You walk over to the device, getting a good look at the robed Scin. Their skin appears almost bone-like with very faint patterns of light green. Unlike the Vi, they have three small horns and barely any hair at all. They seem just as interested in your appearance, looking you up and down. After messing with the device a bit more, the Scin reveals some sort of tablet or drawing implement.`
	"CN-11866" `	As you reach out with your right hand, the Scin leans forward and carefully examines it, then makes another note on their device. After writing down a few more things, they turn to you and gesture strangely, crossing their arms together in a plus-shaped fashion towards their left. The other heavier-armored Scin move closer and escort you back to the elevator and to your ship. Along the way, you notice a few Scin you didn't previously see. Their armor is much different than that of the others, characterized by darker shades, sharper edges, and several gadgets, but what is most notable is their possession of sickle-like blade weapons.`
	"CN-11867" `	Once you return to your ship, the Scin return to theirs, but remain on the planet. Although just as strange, this encounter went far better than the one with the Vi.`
	"CN-11868" `	Looking at you with a confused expression, they draw another portrait that looks like the shorter leather-wearing Gegno from their homeworld and move that image together with the images of the Vi and the Scin. "Gegno," they say, and begin to think to themselves. A brief moment passes, and they begin drawing on the device again. After turning it back to you, you see both a green-colored patch and a brown-colored patch. "Vie," the Scin enunciates, pointing to the brown. "Sinn," they say, now pointing to the green. Afterwards, they point to the group of the three Gegno portraits. "Gegno."`
	"CN-11869" `	Once they mark down a few more notes, they lower their head, and the other Scin usher you back to the elevator, activating it to lower you back to the surface. You're escorted back to your ship, and along the way are a few Scin you didn't previously see. Their armor is much different than that of the others, characterized by darker shades, sharper edges, and several gadgets, but what is most notable is their possession of sickle-like blade weapons.`
	"CN-11870" `	The situation you find yourself in is rather precarious - inside an alien species' vessel, surrounded by strange devices - anything could happen next. You decide to reach for your pistol, but as soon as you do, the first thing you feel is a curved blade around your neck. Slowly turning your head, your eyes are met with the cold, expressionless look of yet another Scin's face, whom you didn't see previously. They continue to hold the blade to your throat as they activate the elevator again, lowering you back to the surface. Their armor is considerably different from the rest, characterized by darker shades, sharper edges, and several gadgets.`
	"CN-11871" `	They escort you back to your ship, and along the way, several more Scin stand guard in the same armor. Once you are at your ship, the blade is moved away from your neck. When you get a better look at it, you realize that the blade is shaped like a sickle as opposed to a sword, meaning there was little chance you could have escaped being decapitated if they had chosen to use it. Boarding your ship in a hurry, you prepare to take off, and you notice the two Scin warships also begin to power up. It's clear you've overstayed your welcome.`
	"CN-11872" `As soon as you attempt to move, the first thing you feel is a curved blade around your neck. The Scin casually marks another note on their device, then leaves the scene, heading deeper into the vessel. Slowly turning your head, your eyes are met with the cold, expressionless look of yet another Scin's face, whom you haven't seen yet. They continue to hold the blade to your throat as they activate the elevator again, lowering you back to the surface. Their armor is considerably different from the rest, characterized by darker shades, sharper edges, and several gadgets.`
	"CN-11873" `	They escort you back to your ship, and along the way, several more Scin stand guard, wearing the same armor. Once you are at your ship, the blade is moved away from your neck. When you get a better look at it, you realize that the blade is shaped like a sickle as opposed to a sword, meaning there was little chance you could have escaped being decapitated if they chose to use it. You board your ship in a hurry, preparing to take off. It's clear you've overstayed your welcome.`
	"CN-11874" `After leaving Ilirco, you recall that the map device showed markings for a few other planets throughout Gegno space as well. From what you can remember, one of them was a desert planet, another was a terrestrial world, and another a small moon. Perhaps these are other possible locations you could encounter the Gegno at in order to try and find a way to learn more about them.`
	"CN-11875" `After the aggressive encounter on <origin>, you recall that the map device showed markings for a few other planets throughout Gegno space as well. From what you can remember, one of them was a desert planet, another was a terrestrial world, and another a small moon. For them to be intentionally marked in such a way could suggest there are other places you could run into the Gegno again, though it might be best to practice caution moving forward.`
	"CN-11876" `As soon as you land your ship, you suddenly receive an incoming hail. "It was incredibly unwise to engage in the unnecessary destruction of noncombatants belonging to a species not of your own." You recognize the voice belonging to that of a Quarg, though it sounds quite displeased. "A species that is still learning from themselves is vulnerable to outside influence, and your aggressive actions against civilians of the Gegno have resulted in needless events."`
	"CN-11877" `	"It was an accident!"`
	"CN-11878" `	"I do not care."`
	"CN-11879" `	"It is greatly unlikely for violence upon unarmed victims to be accidental. Regardless of the cause, the effect has already occurred. The Gegno have banded together under one flag in an effort to deter any more outside interference. You are no longer welcome in their space, and you are advised not to visit again, lest the Gegno show you the same belligerent behavior you have exhibited to their citizens."`
	"CN-11880" `	"Your behavior has caused the Gegno to unite their fleets and deter any more presence from outsiders. It is a great shame. The time they would use to resolve their inner conflicts is now wasted upon hostility towards strangers due to your negligence. You are no longer welcome in Gegno space, and if you dare visit again, the Gegno will demonstrate the same treatment you gave their citizens."`
	"CN-11881" `	The Quarg makes an unpleasant sound - one you have not heard from any Quarg before. "Should you be seen in Gegno space once more, expect the same sentiment."`
	"CN-11882" `As soon as you land your ship, you suddenly receive an incoming hail. "It was incredibly unwise to fire upon guardians of the Gegno homeworld." The voice belongs to that of a Quarg, though it sounds quite displeased. "They simply were present to quell unease of your foreign involvement, yet you chose hostility above their most sacred of planets. You shall find yourself no longer welcome in Gegno space, as well as at the end of our patience."`
	"CN-11883" `	"I was worried they would attack me with their fleets!"`
	"CN-11884" `	"Your concerns matter not when weighed against those of an entire species. As a result of such behavior, the Gegno have banded together to unite their fleets and deter any more presence from outsiders. It is a great shame. The time they would use to resolve their inner conflicts is now wasted upon hostility towards strangers due to your negligence. Leave Gegno space, for you no longer have reason to be here."`
	"CN-11885" `Following your assault on the Gegno fleet, you still attempt to land on the Gegno homeworld, but a large number of hostile ships are already guarding the planet's surface. Suddenly, you receive an incoming hail, though not from the Gegno.`
	"CN-11886" `	"It was incredibly unwise to fire upon guardians of the Gegno homeworld." The frigid voice belongs to that of a Quarg, though it sounds quite displeased. "They simply are present to quell unease of your foreign involvement, yet you chose hostility with them above the most sacred of planets." A Quarg ship then appears from the horizon, quickly flying over to your ship as you receive another hail. "You shall find yourself no longer welcome in Gegno space, as well as at the end of our patience."`
	"CN-11887" `	Without giving pause, the Quarg ship escorts you back into the atmosphere, and the Gegno ships hesitantly pull back for the time being. As you leave the planet, they hail you one last time. "Your actions will have certainly caused instability with the Gegno. Your best course of action is to leave this space at once. We shall be watching." After that, the ship disappears.`
	"CN-11888" `You are greeted by a large force of aliens on the surface of the planet, though they don't seem too happy to welcome you on their world - in fact, several squads in numbers you can't quickly determine rush towards you, equipped with advanced looking combat gear and weapons. As they do, countless ships begin to descend in formations from the sky above.`
	"CN-11889" `You are greeted by a large group of Gegno on the surface of the planet, though they don't seem too happy to welcome you on their world - in fact, several squads in numbers you can't quickly determine rush towards you, equipped with advanced looking combat gear and weapons. As they do, countless ships belonging to both the Vi and Scin factions begin to descend in formations from the sky above.`
	"CN-11890" `	It probably wasn't the smartest plan to purposefully land here after assaulting civilians. There's no room for talk as they immediately begin to attack, and you do your best to fight as many off as you can. While you are able to fend off several with your pistol, you are eventually overwhelmed, and the last thing you experience is a cold, sharp pain through your upper body.`
	"CN-11891" `You begin to receive numerous hails from Gegno Vi ships that are very aggravated in tone. It seems you've interrupted a tradition rather important to them, considering their ships are now appearing hostile on your radar.`
	"CN-11892" `As you are walking through the spaceport, you come across the uncommon pairing of a Hai and a human, their conversation standing out by virtue of speaking the common tongue of humanity.`
	"CN-11893" `	"Oh, oh, Gemanari, this looks interesting!" The human woman looks to be in her late sixties and, when you turn to look, seems to be clucking over a holographic advertisement for a theater show. "This looks adorable, doesn't it? Oh, and it says they're using ripple ray refractive holographic flight effects!"`
	"CN-11894" `	The advertisement does indeed look very impressive, and you pause to observe for a moment.`
	"CN-11895" `	The Hai, presumably Gemanari, also appears to be a more mature lady who squints at it and wrinkles her nose. "Ugh, that's the Germontian interpretation though."`
	"CN-11896" `	This receives a puzzled look to which Gemanari thinks for a second before clarifying. "You would say the Social Darwinist interpretation."`
	"CN-11897" `	The lady grimaces and makes like she's vomiting. "I can't believe you still have those schools of thought in a society this old."`
	"CN-11898" `	"Oh we don't really, at least not in scientific circles, but a compelling story will outlive such things. I can't stand it personally, but it is a classic." When the lady looks unimpressed, Gemanari titters and takes her gently by the arm to steer her away again. "Don't worry Alinta; I think the Misheep Wah'uden company is running my preferred interpretation on <destination> at the moment. We can see if they have any cheap tickets. Of course my aunt would insist that the hundred and eighty-third version is the only real one, but she always..."`
	"CN-11899" `	You lose the conversation as they trail away from you, leaving you to wonder just what was so special about the hundred and eighty-third version of a play about a prehistoric flying Hai found frozen in the ice.`
	"CN-11900" `While stopped in the spaceport waiting for refueling, you are surprised by how hard it is to find somewhere to sit and have a meal and a drink. It seems Hai have crammed themselves into every bar or similar venue with a public display screen, arrayed in sashes and mantles and all manner of other paraphernalia which, near as you can tell, look like... team sport merchandise?`
	"CN-11901" `	You're not really an expert on what such things look like in Hai society and so when you finally find somewhere to sit, at a bar for lack of any other options, you ask the tired-looking bartender what exactly is going on.`
	"CN-11902" `	"Oh this? They're all here for the Musical Entertainment Expo streams. Unfortunately, none of them start drinking until at least one of their teams has announced something of worth," he says with an exasperated eye-roll.`
	"CN-11903" `	"Okay. Can I just get some food here?"`
	"CN-11904" `	"What's the Musical Entertainment Expo?"`
	"CN-11905" `	"Why don't they start drinking yet?"`
	"CN-11906" `	"Well you see, the big music labels do a lot of talent scouting all year round. They all have departments solely dedicated to finding and assembling new music groups to be the next big thing. It's tradition to celebrate only after you've committed to the journey with a new band. Every three years the industry holds ME2, which is what you're seeing up there, to debut their next round of bands and to tease any mid-season releases they might have in the works."`
	"CN-11907" `	"Your music comes off a production line?"`
	"CN-11908" `	"Do you not have musicians trying to make it on their own?"`
	"CN-11909" `	"Oh for sure, but mostly just to get picked up by one of these companies."`
	"CN-11910" `	The bartender chuckles. "We've been doing pop music for longer than your people have had fire. It's about the experience of being a fan of a group as it rises to fame and stardom. A dedicated Hai can go back and find a song for almost any possible life experience in almost any possible genre. It's the journey, and the personalities, that are what it's all about."`
	"CN-11911" `	"How strange."`
	"CN-11912" `	"How interesting."`
	"CN-11913" `	"Anyway, I gather you were after some food?"`
	"CN-11914" `	The bartender tips his head in your direction and takes your order. "No problem, it'll be right up."`
	"CN-11915" `	It's a noisy meal.`
	"CN-11916" `Stepping into the spaceport you are beset by a riot of color. Every blank surface that's not usually paid advertising space seems to be festooned with dangling holographic projectors, banners, and ribbons. There's even actual paper fliers and posters, apparently taped to whatever surface will bear them. At first you wonder if there's some sort of festival going on, but as you watch a young Hai wearing a hood slaps up another holo projector, creating a cartoonish root vegetable with a sword, which begins hacking at the adjacent hologram, some kind of impressionist concept of a Hai elder made up of iridescent triangles. The young Hai then proceeds to tear down a banner and slap some goo on a massive poster which begins dissolving before a pair of security guards, wearing some very obviously non-standard additions to their uniforms, chase him back out of the spaceport.`
	"CN-11917" `	As you watch, the triangular elder being holoprojected seems to flicker and then fizzles out as the battery unit fades, apparently under the assault of the root vegetable which appears to do a victory dance, before proceeding to act out something that makes precisely no sense to you.`
	"CN-11918" `	A little further on you encounter two different groups of protesters, assuming that's what they are, weaving in and out of the spaceport's entrances like some kind of conga line. The triangular elder and opposing root vegetable make several reappearances on their placards, some of them holographically animated.`
	"CN-11919" `	A different security guard, this one in regular attire, appears at your elbow. "You look a little lost. Don't worry, it's just a meme war. Carry on with your business and don't touch the meme items and no one should bother you over it."`
	"CN-11920" `	You thank the security guard for his advice and go about what you were doing as the baffling conflict continues around you.`
	"CN-11921" `	As you watch, the triangular elder being holoprojected seems to flicker and then fizzles out as the battery unit fades, apparently under the assault of the root vegetable which appears to do a victory dance. To your surprise, your translator pipes up: "[Victory, Success] for the true and square root that is more [significant, meaningful] than the tripartite [system, tradition] of the elders!"`
	"CN-11922" `	A different security guard, this one in regular attire, appears at your elbow. "You look a little lost. Don't worry, it's just a meme war. Carry on with your business and don't touch the meme items, and no one should bother you over it."`
	"CN-11923" `	"Sure, will do."`
	"CN-11924" `	"Your elders have a tripartite system?"`
	"CN-11925" `	The security guard chuckles and says, "Oh you can understand? They don't really, but it's a very old joke from a bygone political campaign that there are only three tenets the elders care about, and they're all the ones that affect us the least."`
	"CN-11926" `	When you ask what has triggered this, he says, "Oh, the latest education priorities came out with a four tenet focus, on the same day that an elder accidentally quoted the old campaign. It has been very entertaining."`
	"CN-11927" `	"Sounds fun."`
	"CN-11928" `As you pass through the spaceport you notice a crowd of trilling Hai clustered in one area.`
	"CN-11929" `	(Ignore them and pass by.)`
	"CN-11930" `	The crowd appears to be mostly made up of younger Hai, though a few more mature Hai are also there, visibly exhibiting more restraint on their enthusiasm. Reaching the edge of the crowd and peering over the shorter Hai folk, you can see a table set up with two standing banners flanking it and a stack of, at a glance, glossy printed photos.`
	"CN-11931" `	The banners depict a rather buff looking Hai, rendered in great detail, with a holographically enhanced animation that makes it appear to be continuously going through the motion of lifting and dropping a generically blurred opponent. The effect is, though, achieved solely through a trick of artificially shifting perspective. To your surprise you realize that this is a signing event for a wrestling star, of all things.`
	"CN-11932" `	After only a moment the individual in question emerges from a booth behind the setup and greets their fans, who prove very enthusiastic, before sitting down with some kind of pen for the assembled Hai to line up. It would seem that certain human customs have become popularized among the Hai.`
	"CN-11933" `	You can hear the Hai crowd trilling for some distance as you go about your business.`
	"CN-11934" `	The banners depict a svelte Hai in the strikingly familiar costume of a fencer, with a holographically enhanced animation that makes it appear to be continuously performing an elegant parry and riposte against an out-of-frame opponent. The effect is, though, achieved solely through a trick of artificially shifting perspective. To your surprise you realize that this is a signing event for a fencing star, of all things.`
	"CN-11935" `	The banners depict a pair of Hai, one with a net and one with what looks like a bladed frisbee. It's not at all clear what precisely it is that they do, and when the individuals in question emerge from a booth behind the setup and greet their fans it becomes clear that, if you could even make yourself heard over the trilling, no one is particularly keen to explain it to you.`
	"CN-11936" `	The pair remove their helmets and flash dazzling Hai smiles at their fans before sitting down with some kind of pen for the assembled Hai to line up. It would seem that celebrity signings are popular among the Hai.`
	"CN-11937" `You stop at a diner for a meal ground-side at the spaceport, but you have not been seated long before you notice there is a group of other human ship captains sequestered in a corner playing, near as you can tell, a game of poker. You note that the group seems to be getting a variety of dark looks from various Hai also dining at the establishment.`
	"CN-11938" `	After a short while the barkeep, a middling and slightly overweight Hai, comes over to take your order.`
	"CN-11939" `	(Place an order.)`
	"CN-11940" `	"Hey, I noticed there are some dark looks around here. Are human captains not welcome?"`
	"CN-11941" `	The barkeep looks confused for a second before looking over at the table and shaking his head in understanding. "Oh no, you're perfectly welcome. That group is just breaking the maturity tenets, and some Hai get uncomfortable with adults blatantly acting like children in public."`
	"CN-11942" `	"The maturity tenets?"`
	"CN-11943" `	"Oh right, I suppose you wouldn't know. There are a number of tenets that Hai are taught growing up, lessons to be internalized to be a responsible and functioning member of society. The second is 'To be honest in dealings,' and the third is 'To gamble only on skill, not chance,' so their game breaks two of them."`
	"CN-11944" `	"Some would say poker is more about skill than chance."`
	"CN-11945" `	"Surely if it's just a game though, there's no harm in it?"`
	"CN-11946" `	"Oh no, I'm afraid the first tenet ensures that it's really not favorable either way. The first is 'To have clear separation of fantasy and reality,' so a game cannot have real consequences or it is reality, not fantasy. So to gamble money on the game is to bring real consequences to a fantasy exercise. This is taboo for an adult.`
	"CN-11947" `	"If you interpret the game as being played for the skill, without the wagering, then you clear the first and third tenet, but you have the issue that the principle skills are bluffing and manipulation, which violates the second tenet. Bluffing isn't a skill seen as having virtue, nor is manipulation."`
	"CN-11948" `	"Wait, do the Hai not lie or bluff?"`
	"CN-11949" `	The barkeep chortles with a strange trill and says, "Oh no, the Hai do lie and bluff. We're actually very good at bluffing, evolutionarily advantageous in the wild and all that. It's just seen as very immature and base. An adult should be able to conduct their life without resorting to such primitive instincts. We learned that the hard way long ago, back before we holed up in our current borders."`
	"CN-11950" `	He looks at you intently before continuing, "You won't hear the tenets brought up very much, but if you look closely you'll see that the first three especially are ingrained in our society very deeply."`
	"CN-11951" `	With a shrug he flips open his order pad and pats his belly. "Of course, my gran always said that any of them after the tenth were more guidelines than actual rules, and I certainly have my share of disagreements with thirteen. Now, before I talk your ears off, what'll I get for you?"`
	"CN-11952" `	He takes your order diligently and with a smile.`
	"CN-11953" `On this particular day, the spaceport is crowded beyond belief by some arcane confluence of chance and logistics. Despite having resolved the bulk of your business the port authorities have informed you that there is no safe departure slot open for at least seven hours (and even that's not a promise). This leaves you alone to fill in your unexpected bit of time in the early morning.`
	"CN-11954" `	(Play games on my ship.)`
	"CN-11955" `	(Have a look around further afield.)`
	"CN-11956" `	Not interested in getting lost in an expansive Hai city, you simply load up an entertainment console to keep you occupied for the next few hours.`
	"CN-11957" `	The tendency of the Hai to efficiently pack people into vibrant but densely populated spaces is on full display as you navigate through throngs of Hai who mostly make polite efforts to avoid bumping into you. Colorful banners, flags, murals, and even windows all provide brilliant highlights to the oft-utilitarian architectural styles underlying them. Holoprojected welcome signs even grace the entry-ways of several apartment buildings that you pass, with caveats for door-to-door salespeople.`
	"CN-11958" `	One apartment complex's exterior fencing bears a very large sign which your translator informs you says, "No Meme Content Here Please."`
	"CN-11959" `	After some time you find what appears to be a cafe, or equivalent, and sit down where you can get a good view of one of the more impressive building complexes around. After a moment a holoprojection built into the table asks you in human standard whether you'd like to order through the table or converse with a member of staff.`
	"CN-11960" `	(Order through the table.)`
	"CN-11961" `	(Order through a person.)`
	"CN-11962" `	A friendly Hai emerges to take your order and politely informs you that there's a 10% surcharge for eating on the terrace. Since that's hardly a meaningful sum to a ship's captain you just nod and try and work out what you're eating. Eventually you settle for a sandwich with acorn butter and vegetable slices that appear to be spiced, or pickled, you're not really sure. It was the staff's top recommended item and didn't come with any follow-up questions about Hai food preferences that you couldn't answer.`
	"CN-11963" `	The interface is rather annoying to work with human-sized hands, but eventually you settle for a sandwich with acorn butter and vegetable slices that appear to be spiced, or pickled, you're not really sure. It was the top recommended item and didn't come with any follow-up questions about Hai food preferences that you couldn't answer.`
	"CN-11964" `	As you eat your strange, but actually surprisingly tasty lunch, you take note of the large text written above the gateway into the grounds for the building complex opposite you. After a moment your translator box takes note of where you're looking and reads it aloud for you.`
	"CN-11965" `	"To know is to lead, to study is to know, to serve is to study, to lead is to serve."`
	"CN-11966" `	Naturally, your translator cannot answer questions, so you eat your lunch and leave it be until a staff member emerges to take your plate.`
	"CN-11967" `	(Ask them about it.)`
	"CN-11968" `	(Keep my thoughts to myself.)`
	"CN-11969" `	The staff member takes your plate and wishes you a lovely day.`
	"CN-11970" `	As they clear your plate from the table you ask them about the text on the gateway.`
	"CN-11971" `	"Oh, that's the city Academy. It's a... uh..." she pauses for a moment and relays something in Hai which your translator immediately converts to, "non-technical university."`
	"CN-11972" `	Giving the box a surprised look she smiles and continues in Hai, "If you want to be a manager, a politician, a social worker, or even just a public speaker, you go to the Academy and do courses on leadership and communications. Strictly speaking, it's not necessary to go, but lots of places simply won't accept you into those sorts of roles without some sort of Academy qualification, and they really do provide some great skills. I'm actually going there next year to do a proper human language course.`
	"CN-11973" `	"Technically the Academies are all independent, but they all share the same motto. It's an obligatory thing too though, that's what the motto is about. I'm told most humans think it's backwards, but it's not. The Academies keep tabs on their graduates; if you lead with self-interest, serve without studying, study without learning or waste your knowledge without applying it, they've been known to revoke people's qualifications. Attendance is free, so there's an expectation that you don't waste what they spend time teaching you.`
	"CN-11974" `	"This one is quite prestigious, but the ones near the spaceports always are." She winks. "Experience through natural exposure is worth more than what money can buy, after all."`
	"CN-11975" `	A moment later your comm pad alerts you that you've been assigned a departure window from the spaceport in relatively short order.`
	"CN-11976" `	"Well, I must be attending to other customers. You have a great day!" she says, leaving you to go about your business.`
	"CN-11977" `Passing down the main thoroughfare of this spaceport you almost ignore a stack of haphazardly piled crates in the median strip. It's not uncommon for recently unloaded crates to temporarily sit in front of different businesses in a port, placed conspicuously out of the way of the flow of foot traffic, but it is the disordered piling that seems out of place.`
	"CN-11978" `	No sooner do you slow your step to give it your attention though, than the pile of crates immediately springs to life.`
	"CN-11979" `	Music plays and some half dozen robotic caricatures of Hai in exaggerated dress spring forth from various crates and begin to caper about in a series of interactions presumably intended to be comedic, at least judging by how they keep turning away from each other to "look" at the audience and wink. Holoprojected banners and glyphs, presumably advertisement information, flicker through a series of displays as it goes through a cycle before the entire cohort appear to finish up; each onlooker the recipient of some kind of entreaty from at least one robot, before they immediately clamber back into the crates.`
	"CN-11980" `	Throughout this a handful of Hai have stopped to watch, and a couple of them let out small chuckles at the conclusion before continuing on their way. Most of them simply roll their eyes and move on though. One child wanders too close as their parents steer around it and a little red holographic warning sign briefly flashes at them. No one seems keen to explain what you just saw, and for the moment the crates remain resolutely closed.`
	"CN-11981" `	Now that you think about it, you're not sure they all climbed back into the same boxes they came out of.`
	"CN-11982" `	Music plays and some half dozen robotic caricatures of Hai in exaggerated dress spring forth from various crates and begin to caper about in a series of interactions. Your translator struggles to keep up as they run through a rapid-fire string of presumably witty wordplay jokes that don't translate well. The humor appears to be improvisational at first, but the illusion is so good that the realization of the impossibility of robots improvising only catches up with you after the fact. The entire thing is set to a musical score, with beat rests at various points where the animatronic Hai keep turning away from each other to 'look' at the audience and wink. Holoprojected banners and glyphs flicker through a series of displays informing you that this is an advertisement for a fully robotic comedy musical called "The Grandmother's Rules." It claims to be complete with interactive heckling responses and provides a list of dates and venues, all in the far future, where it will be showing.`
	"CN-11983" `	At the end each one of the robots strikes a pose and invites a different demographic to come along and "have the time of a decade," with ticket prices starting from 73 credits, before the entire cohort finish up and immediately clamber back into the crates. You're not sure they all climbed back into the same boxes they came out of.`
	"CN-11984" `	Throughout this a handful of Hai have stopped to watch, and a couple of them let out small chuckles at the conclusion before continuing on their way. Most of them simply roll their eyes and move on though.`
	"CN-11985" `	One middle-aged Hai in the crowd with racoon-like gray around his eyes wears the type of attire typical of their merchant captains. He eyes you curiously and steps over to you. "Well, well, Captain, that's a remarkable box you have there. Didn't know they'd started making live translator devices! Did it keep up alright?"`
	"CN-11986" `	"Oh, it's the first of its kind."`
	"CN-11987" `	"I think I got the gist of it, though it only reads things out if I look directly at them."`
	"CN-11988" `	"Ah yes, I suppose that's a logical feature," he says. "I can only imagine it would be quite unwieldy if it tried to read out every piece of text in its vicinity.`
	"CN-11989" `	"The first?" He studies you for a second. "Oh, you're Captain <last>! What a pleasure to meet you."`
	"CN-11990" `	He looks you up and down with a wry grin. "Somehow you're shorter than I expected.`
	"CN-11991" `	"Well if you do get the chance, I do recommend the performance. I saw it a few months back and it really is quite good. Particularly popular on our worlds with many humans."`
	"CN-11992" `	He flicks you a friendly wave. "I must be off. Don't get too close to the displays, they don't like being touched!"`
	"CN-11993" `	The Hai sounds very pleased as he ambles off, quietly chortling to himself as he departs.`
	"CN-11994" `Upon visiting the spaceport, you notice a poster for a movie in Hai. You recognize it as taking place on Darkrest, and quickly realize that this must be the movie that Likeet had made. The Hai-language title has been translated to "The Final Rest," but the full movie doesn't appear to have been subtitled in your language yet.`
	"CN-11995" `	(Go see it.)`
	"CN-11996" `	You find a movie theater showing Likeet's film. You're not quite sure what's happening: something to do with an unseen monster inhabiting the station that slowly drives those it meets insane. It seems to be a hit with the Hai audience, though, and you leave the theater feeling distinctly unnerved.`
	"CN-11997" `	You find a movie theater showing Likeet's film, but your translator is of little help here. The movie is sparse on dialog, and the few lines spoken in the movie seem to be cryptic references to Hai literature and philosophy. The most you are able to make out is that the movie is about an unseen monster inhabiting the station that slowly drives those it meets insane. It seems to be a hit with the Hai audience, though, and you leave the theater feeling distinctly unnerved.`
	"CN-11998" `With some time to kill while your ship is being serviced by the Hai dockhands, you enter the spaceport searching for a bite to eat. Restaurants advertise their menus in bright, attention-grabbing colors on their windows; among the selection, you spot one that promises "authentic Hai cuisine," along with some large text printed in the Hai language. Next to it, you see a human street food vendor offering snacks and ready-made meals.`
	"CN-11999" `	(Enter the restaurant.)`
	"CN-12000" `	(Buy something from the human food vendor instead.)`
	"CN-12001" `	(On second thought, I'm not that hungry.)`
	"CN-12002" `	Food made by humans is certainly the safer option. The vendor sells you a dish comprised of steamed vegetables, along with a fillet of some yellow-tinged fish which she assures you is perfectly edible. The meal is somewhat bland, but the fish is buttery and tender. You dispose of the leftovers in a nearby garbage receptacle, and you watch as it beeps melodically, incinerating the refuse.`
	"CN-12003" `	A Hai restaurant is sure to provide a more unique experience. The door jingles a short melody as you enter the establishment, and a middle-aged female Hai with her back to you shouts something in the Hai language.`
	"CN-12004" `	You freeze for a second, as it is unclear what the Hai wants from you.`
	"CN-12005" `	Your translator chirps dutifully, "Have a [seat, rest] anywhere you like! I'll be right with you."`
	"CN-12006" `	Only a short moment later, the same Hai hostess peers over at you and chitters in what you assume is embarrassment. "I'm so sorry. I didn't realize I would have the pleasure of serving a human today. Please, have a seat anywhere at the bar. I'll come to take your order shortly."`
	"CN-12007" `	You take a look around and note that the restaurant is actually quite crowded. There are Hai dressed in fancy tuxedos, fashionable clothing, casual dress, and even some wearing peculiar overalls with holes in the backs for their tails; there don't seem to be any other humans. With only a few seats available, you select one on the end, next to a rather large Hai wearing green overalls and an orange straw hat. He grunts noncommittally as you sit down on a stool clearly designed for an organism with a tail. Before long, the hostess approaches and asks for your order.`
	"CN-12008" `	"I'll have today's special."`
	"CN-12009" `	"I'd like some soup, please."`
	"CN-12010" `	"You're in luck," she says. "Today only, each meal is served with a free side of acorn bread." She scampers off to place and retrieve your order.`
	"CN-12011" `	The Hai next to you grunts again - this time with clear frustration - and turns to speak. "Acorn bread! That's all they serve here anymore. Ever since you humans arrived in our space, that's all we get to eat. Traditional Hai breadmaking has become a lost art."`
	"CN-12012" `	"Can you tell me about traditional Hai breadmaking?"`
	"CN-12013" `	"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend your culture."`
	"CN-12014" `	He seems somewhat calmed by your interest.`
	"CN-12015" `	The look on his face softens. "I should be the one to apologize. It's not your fault that our spaceports' menus have changed in this respect. Humans have also brought new life to many parts of Hai society. It is only a pity that we have to travel far to find the types of bread that we had in years past."`
	"CN-12016" `	"Can you tell me about other types of bread?" you ask.`
	"CN-12017" `	"Oh yes." He shifts his weight on the stool. "I'm old enough to remember hayipp bread, yur ki bread - you name it. Hayipp is a grain, similar to your human 'corn,' which creates a wholesome ruddy brown flour when milled. The bread was hearty, yet exquisite." You note the wistful look on his face. "Yur ki is a milk, sourced from livestock we raise. You may have seen some on Newhome; I'm told your kind has a similar animal called 'sheep.' Bread made from yur ki is rich and decadent. It is among my favorite foods to have for breakfast." He pauses for a moment and looks a bit downcast. "Acorn bread was once a rare sight in Hai cuisine. Far too sweet. But, since humans have joined us on our planets, all they want is acorn bread. The high demand has displaced all of the traditional breads that I grew up with from high traffic areas such as this spaceport restaurant. I miss having them easily available."`
	"CN-12018" `	As if on cue, the hostess arrives with both of your meals. The Hai next to you, whose name you still do not know, sighs as he sees his free acorn bread, but he eats it nonetheless. You each finish your meals in silence and leave.`
	"CN-12019" `This planet is populated by an alien species that resemble giant, intelligent squirrels. However, the most surprising aspect of the spaceport is not the aliens, but the fact that human merchants and other civilians are walking among them and are clearly at home here. Would you like to find someone who can tell you what is going on here?`
	"CN-12020" `	(Sure.)`
	"CN-12021" `This planet is populated by an alien species that resemble giant, intelligent squirrels. Their ships look exactly like the ones that you saw on the news. But despite the violence that Campbell spoke of, there are human merchants and other civilians walking among them that are clearly at home here.`
	"CN-12022" `	You walk up to a human merchant who is busy haggling with one of the aliens. They interrupt their conversation when they see you approaching, and the human gestures for you to join them. "You look totally lost," he says. "First time down the rabbit hole?"`
	"CN-12023" `	You nod. The alien reaches out a paw to shake hands with you. "Welcome to Hai space," they say. "We are people of peace, and you are free to visit us or even live among us. Our worlds provide enough bounty for all."`
	"CN-12024" `The Hai here seem more friendly and approachable than those you met earlier. Even more surprising though is the fact that human merchants and other civilians are walking among them and are clearly at home here. Would you like to find someone who can tell you what is going on here?`
	"CN-12025" `The Hai here seem more friendly and approachable than those you met earlier. Surprisingly, there are human merchants and other civilians walking among them that are clearly at home here, in stark contrast to the other Hai and the violence that Campbell spoke of.`
	"CN-12026" `	You walk up to a human merchant who is busy haggling with one of the Hai. They interrupt their conversation when they see you approaching, and the human gestures for you to join them. "You look lost," he says. "First time down the rabbit hole?"`
	"CN-12027" `	"No, I've actually met with the Hai up north," you respond. The merchant looks slightly concerned with this, but the Hai only seems to sigh.`
	"CN-12028" `	"Ah, you have met our wayward sisters and brothers. I hope that they did not cause you too much trouble, for they are misled in their ways," they say. "Welcome to Hai space. Unlike those that you met before, the rest of us are a people of peace, and you are free to visit us or even live among us. Our worlds provide enough bounty for all."`
	"CN-12029" `	You glance quickly at the human merchant to see his expression, wondering if these aliens can indeed be so benign, but his expression is calm and untroubled. "It's true," he says, "look around you. These buildings have stood for thousands of years. Hai society is so advanced, they need almost no resources to maintain it."`
	"CN-12030" `	"Campbell didn't mention anything about humans living here on the news."`
	"CN-12031" `	"This place looks a lot calmer than it did on the news."`
	"CN-12032" `	"The news?" the merchant asks while raising an eyebrow? "What do you mean 'on the news'?" You explain the situation with Campbell's video of Hai ships in combat and how it was all over the news back in human space. "Ah, I see. Well there's a lot of stuff that this 'Campbell' left out," the merchant says while looking very disappointed. "Please, judge the Hai for yourself."`
	"CN-12033" `	"Ah, yes. Well there's a lot of stuff that Campbell left out with that little stunt of his," the merchant says while looking very disappointed. "I'm just hoping that life here stays quiet. And please, judge the Hai for yourself."`
	"CN-12034" `	"How did humanity reach this place? Did they use jump drives?"`
	"CN-12035" `	The human merchant raises an eyebrow. "Can't say I'm familiar with what a jump drive is. In case you aren't in the know, though, there's a wormhole in Hai space that connects back to a secluded part of human space. Don't bother trying to figure out why and how it's there, because not even the Hai know."`
	"CN-12036" `	"Why do you allow humans to settle here?"`
	"CN-12037" `	"What do you ask for in return for letting humans settle here?"`
	"CN-12038" `	"Humans are a young species," the Hai says, "full of energy, full of new ideas. And the Hai are old, and everything we do is what we have done before. When humans go on vacation, they travel to a world with perfect weather, sunny every day. When Hai go on vacation, we visit the stormiest world, to find unpredictability and change. Humans are so strange, that to speak with a human is like a small vacation." They smile, and you catch a glimpse of its massive incisors. Based on your knowledge of xenobiology you would guess that the Hai are herbivores, but you can't be certain.`
	"CN-12039" `	"So I'm allowed to travel throughout your territory if I want?"`
	"CN-12040" `	"How come people back in human space don't know that you are here?"`
	"CN-12041" `	"If your people are peaceful then why are the Hai from the north so hostile?"`
	"CN-12042" `	The human merchant laughs. "Probably because most of us came here to escape from the chaos and fighting in human space. The last thing we want is for it to follow us here. Not that I'm saying you can't tell anyone about the wormhole, but if I were you I wouldn't go spreading the news too widely either. And take a look around Hai space before you leave; you'll find that we could learn a lot from them."`
	"CN-12043" `	"So I can travel anywhere I want in your territory?" you ask the Hai.`
	"CN-12044" `	"Yes," they say, "but be careful. The north is the territory of some renegade Hai who are misled in their ways: bandits and pirates, living off what they steal from the rest of us. If you travel among them, you will not be safe."`
	"CN-12045" `	"Also," the human adds, "I've heard rumors that the 'Unfettered' Hai are trying to get human captains who land on their worlds to do some tasks for them. I'm not particularly interested in finding out what those tasks are, but if you see something suspicious happening, that might be it."`
	"CN-12046" `	"If your people are peaceful then why are the Hai from the north so hostile?" you ask the Hai.`
	"CN-12047" `	"I am young, and the origins of our 'Unfettered' brethren are before my time," they respond. "If you want to know more, it might be wise to find someone much older than myself to ask."`
	"CN-12048" `	You talk for a while longer, but do not gain much additional information except that several of their worlds are willing to sell Hai technology even to human beings. You thank them both for stopping to talk with you, and the Hai responds, "We are always glad to welcome new friends. May peace dwell in your heart until we meet again."`
	"CN-12049" `The Unfettered Hai say that they are the "true Hai," and seem to think that the other Hai are oppressing them, but another Hai that you spoke to said that the Unfettered Hai are simply misled. Would you like to look for someone here who can tell you more of the story?`
	"CN-12050" `	You find an elderly-looking Hai who is sitting on a bench watching the starships land and take off. As you approach, he says, "Hello human."`
	"CN-12051" `	"Hello. I've met some of the Unfettered Hai. What can you tell me about them?"`
	"CN-12052" `	"Hello. Can you tell me why you are at war with the other Hai who live to the north?"`
	"CN-12053" `	He says, "Ah, our wayward sisters and brothers to the north. You have surely seen what our society is like: safe, stable, predictable, deliberate. It suits most of us well. But there are those..."`
	"CN-12054" `	He says, "I would not call it war. We launch no raids on them. We only defend when they attack. And, we supply them with food and other things needful for life. They are not our enemies, they are just those who do not fit in. You have surely seen what our society is like: safe, stable, predictable, deliberate. It suits most of us well. But there are those..."`
	"CN-12055" `	He pauses. "No, I am telling this unfairly. I will start again. Hundreds of years ago, when I was young, our territory was raided by aliens from the east, who came in massive warships and plundered our worlds. In those days there were some Hai who were brave enough to risk their lives to defend us. The raids lasted for decades, then abruptly stopped.`
	"CN-12056" `	"Most of those who had fought the invaders were glad to return to ordinary life, but there were some for whom life now seemed bland and meaningless without the excitement and chaos of war. They started colonies in the systems to the north, and fought amongst themselves, and mismanaged the land, and grew in numbers. And now their worlds cannot feed them all, and they invade us and tell stories to put blame on us for their failures."`
	"CN-12057" `	"Shouldn't they be treated with gratitude for defending you against the raiders?"`
	"CN-12058" `	"They said the Drak altered the Hai to make them less aggressive. Is that true?"`
	"CN-12059" `	"That's all I wanted to know. Thanks."`
	"CN-12060" `	"They were, and still should be. There will always be times when our society needs them. Only at this time, the need is not so great. There is no new frontier for them to explore, no worthy challenges for them to face. And we fear what would happen if they ventured south and gained access to the wormhole, so we must force them to stay where they are."`
	"CN-12061" `	"No," he says, "it is a story they invented, that the Hai were destined to be masters of the galaxy but the Drak and the Quarg prevented us. The story is not true. Our civilization beyond the wormhole was brought down by infighting and unwise governance. Amid the wreckage we studied and thought and argued and came to believe that we could rule a small territory with stability and peace, or hold more worlds but with constant turmoil. We chose stability, and relinquished those worlds."`
	"CN-12062" `	"So you don't think the Drak are keeping us all in cages?"`
	"CN-12063" `	He thinks about the question for a while, then says, "Sometimes we make a fire for cooking food. The fire consumes much wood, and the flames are tall, too wild and hot to cook food well. Then the wood becomes coals that burn slowly with no flames or smoke, and when you gather them they are good for roasting meat or even baking bread. Perhaps each species must consume many worlds and many resources before learning to burn slowly, and the wisdom of the Drak is to allow them to do so. But when they find balance, as we did, they no longer need so much space."`
	"CN-12064" `	You thank him for taking time to speak with you, and say goodbye.`
	"CN-12065" `As the <ship> drops out of hyperspace, your dashboard is filled with an array of warning lights. It isn't hard to find the cause; even from this distance, the light of the wormhole is as clear as crystal, tinting everything around it a pale purple. The arms of the vortex rotate seemingly lethargically, but you know that, close up, the bands of energy that make it up must be moving several orders of magnitude faster than the top speed of your ship.`
	"CN-12066" `	Your sightseeing is interrupted by a hail on an encrypted frequency. You open it and are met with what you vaguely recognize as a short greeting in the Hai language.`
	"CN-12067" `	"Could you repeat that?"`
	"CN-12068" `	"Sorry, I don't speak Hai."`
	"CN-12069" `	You receive a reply in the form of a hearty chuckle. "My bad, friend," the Hai hailing you says. "Used to be that anyone who grew up in Hai space knew Hai, but I guess that isn't really true anymore, what with Greenwater and such.`
	"CN-12070" `	"Anyway, back on topic. You've probably heard this a hundred times, but it bears repeating: Unless you're certain that the other person already knows, don't talk about the Hai, Hai space, or any Hai technology. Got it?"`
	"CN-12071" `	"Why do I have to lie?"`
	"CN-12072" `	The Hai lets out another laugh, this time more nervous. "You know, there's some people out there who'd be able to say what you just did with a straight face."`
	"CN-12073" `	"Alright, I'll be on my way."`
	"CN-12074" `	"I'm serious."`
	"CN-12075" `	While you can't see your conversation partner over the commlink, you get the feeling that they'd be pinching the bridge of their nose right now. "A few decades ago, you'd be hard-pressed to find a captain who'd even consider revealing the existence of the Hai. Nowadays, it feels like even Hai are clamoring to go public, regardless of the turmoil it would bring.`
	"CN-12076" `	"But this isn't just about protecting Hai space. There are groups who have more than enough motive and ability to cover up any attempts of stirring chaos in human space, including anybody looking to expose the existence of a yet-unknown sapient species.`
	"CN-12077" `	"Anyway, stay safe out there." The hail cuts off.`
	"CN-12078" `	"Glad to hear it. See you around, Captain." The hail cuts off.`
	"CN-12079" `As you sit in a spaceport bar waiting for the food that you've ordered, a Hai unceremoniously pulls up a chair opposite you and takes a seat. He looks to be a merchant, and one who has seen more than a few things besides. He squints at you before speaking, "You are Captain <last>, are you not?"`
	"CN-12080" `	"That would be me."`
	"CN-12081" `	"I think you have the wrong captain."`
	"CN-12082" `	He slaps a device on the table, and a small holographic projection of your face springs up and begins rotating around. "No, I think not."`
	"CN-12083" `	He heaves a sigh. "You've been fighting the Unfettered, you see, and there are some Hai that don't take too kindly to that. They view you as an outsider sticking your nose into Hai internal politics. Some of those are what we merchants like to call Sympathizers, and they can get a little carried away with themselves and fire off a few shots if they see someone like yourself getting a little too gun-happy where the Unfettered are concerned."`
	"CN-12084" `	With a wave of his hand he indicates the spaceport around you. "You might have potentially noticed some difficulty landing. You see, because there are lots of people who don't like outsiders putting their noses in where they're not wanted, if you happen to shoot back and accidentally destroy a Sympathizer's ship, the authorities don't much care who shot first. There are enough of those opinions to ensure that if you shoot down a Sympathizer, it is treated no differently than if you shot down any other Hai merchant. The security forces will treat it the same.`
	"CN-12085" `	"Now the merchants, we're a different matter. It is a topic of great and ongoing debate among us, and some people are less offended when you shoot down someone they've been arguing with. Everyone has friends on all sides though, so you should watch yourself nonetheless. Sympathizers may become upset enough to shoot at you anywhere they see you, but the simple fact of the matter is that, if you retaliate against a Hai, any Hai, it'll upset someone and count against you. Even if that Hai was a Sympathizer, and even if they shot first."`
	"CN-12086" `	He looks at you very seriously to make sure what he's said has sunk in.`
	"CN-12087" `	"I understand, thank you for warning me."`
	"CN-12088" `	"Why should I get in trouble for defending myself against Sympathizers?"`
	"CN-12089" `	"I understand that I've stepped on some toes."`
	"CN-12090" `	"How could I be in trouble for defending myself against Sympathizers?"`
	"CN-12091" `	He shrugs. "You should try not to impart human ethical standards onto Hai. The simple fact of the matter is that they are citizens, and you are not.`
	"CN-12092" `	"When a report is made that you have destroyed the vessel of a Hai citizen, it is up to the local security staff to verify the chain of events. If they report it was your fault, then it was your fault, unless you can challenge that in a court. However, you are not a citizen, so the security apparatus can simply brand you as a pirate and prevent you from ever gaining access to a court to challenge it in the first place. Even if you managed to do so, you're a captain; your business is in space. You would be grounded for months to work through the court proceedings to challenge it.`
	"CN-12093" `	"Whether you believe it is right or not, it is simply the reality of the situation. You must manage your guns and your reputation carefully where interactions with the Unfettered are concerned."`
	"CN-12094" `	"You have gotten yourself in trouble, Captain."`
	"CN-12095" `	He slides a data stick across to you. "Fortunately for you, in this case, I happened to see the event, and have argued that you did not know what you were getting into. This stick contains the security report file which indicates that you have been given a warning... keep this for your records; Hai Security certainly will. There will not be future warnings."`
	"CN-12096" `	"So far, you have been lucky. Hai Security has taken your history into account, and decided your recent activities are within the tolerable range of responses to the hostile situations you have got yourself into..." He slides a data stick across to you. "Nevertheless, this is a copy of the file on you that states you have now been advised of the situation. If you now proceed to upset Hai Security, they will not provide you with a warning."`
	"CN-12097" `	The waitress arrives with your food, and the merchant stands up. "Good luck, Captain. If you get into trouble, I recommend picking up some jobs to take aid supplies to the Unfettered, if you can manage that without shooting anyone..."`
	"CN-12098" `	With a nod, he leaves you to your meal.`
	"CN-12099" `You are stopped by a human in the <origin> marketplace. He takes off his hat and asks, "You're from the outside, aren't you?"`
	"CN-12100" `	"What do you mean 'the outside?'"`
	"CN-12101" `	"Outside of Hai space. You don't look quite like most humans who live here, unless there's some new fashion trend going on that I don't know about."`
	"CN-12102" `	"Oh, yes. I do come from outside."`
	"CN-12103" `You are stopped by a human in the marketplace of <origin>. He takes off his hat and asks, "You wouldn't happen to be a captain from the outside, would you?"`
	"CN-12104" `	"No, I grew up here."`
	"CN-12105" `	"Why? Do you need to go somewhere?"`
	"CN-12106" `	He sighs. "I figured as such. You can usually tell when people aren't from here by their clothing."`
	"CN-12107" `	The man thinks for a moment. "Would it be too much of a hassle for you to take a trip to human space?"`
	"CN-12108" `	"I'd be happy to take you there."`
	"CN-12109" `	"Sorry, but no. You'll have to find another captain."`
	"CN-12110" `	"Good. My name is Elliot." You introduce yourself to Elliot and shake hands.`
	"CN-12111" `	"I do. My name is Elliot." You introduce yourself to Elliot and shake hands.`
	"CN-12112" `	"Can you take me to <destination>?" Elliot asks.`
	"CN-12113" `	"That's all the way in the Dirt Belt," you say. "Why do you want to go that far?"`
	"CN-12114" `	Elliot looks down at the ground for a second and takes a deep breath while gripping his hat in his hands. "You see, I haven't lived here all my life. I was born on <planet> to a poor farming family. Most of my days were spent working on the farm, which I hated with a passion. One day I just got fed up with things and I ran away.`
	"CN-12115" `	"I ran away from home to the spaceport city and snuck my way into the cargo hold of a freighter. The captain didn't open the cargo hold for three weeks while I stayed in it. Lucky for me the freighter was transporting food, so I had plenty to eat.`
	"CN-12116" `	"When the cargo hold doors finally opened, I ran out as fast as I could, only to run back in at the sight of a group of Hai. I had no idea where I was at the time, but I've been living here ever since. That was when I was thirteen, nearly five years ago now."`
	"CN-12117" `	Elliot looks down at the ground again and wipes a tear from the corner of his eye.`
	"CN-12118" `	"Alright, I'll take you to <planet>."`
	"CN-12119" `	"And you finally want to go back home?"`
	"CN-12120" `	"Sorry, but I'm not able to take you that far."`
	"CN-12121" `	"Yes. I've thought a lot about it lately. I want to see my family again."`
	"CN-12122" `	"I understand," Elliot says. "I'll just try and find someone else to help me. Goodbye, <first>."`
	"CN-12123" `	You lead Elliot to your ship and show him to a bunk room. After leaving Elliot there, you wonder if his family is still even on <planet> anymore.`
	"CN-12124" `Elliot thanks you for bringing him to <planet> and hands you <payment>. He flags down a taxi just outside the spaceport, but before entering the taxi he turns back to you.`
	"CN-12125" `	"Do you want to come with me? I'd love for you to meet my family. They'll want to meet you when I tell them how I got back."`
	"CN-12126" `	"Sorry, I have other places to be. Good luck."`
	"CN-12127" `	"Sure. I've come with you this far."`
	"CN-12128" `	"I understand. Thanks again, <first>. I'll always owe you."`
	"CN-12129" `	Elliot gets into the taxi, which drives off toward the seemingly endless farmlands outside of the spaceport city.`
	"CN-12130" `	The view for nearly the entire three hour drive is of hills and farmland with the occasional building or wild animal. Elliot shakes as the taxi approaches the house from the driveway. "I'm wondering if they still even live here," he says nervously.`
	"CN-12131" `	No one comes out of the house when the taxi stops. You walk up to the front door with Elliot and a middle-aged woman answers the door with a mug of coffee and a bewildered look on her face.`
	"CN-12132" `	"Can I help you?" the woman asks.`
	"CN-12133" `	Elliot looks over at you with a big smile on his face. "Yes you can, mom," he says to her. The woman's face lights up with joy and she begins jumping up and down, spilling coffee from her mug.`
	"CN-12134" `	"Oh Elliot, I can't believe it!" Elliot's mom puts down her mug and leaps out the door to hug him. "Jackson! Sarah! Abby! Sean! Victor! Elliot is here!" Elliot's entire family comes out from the house and greets him, asking dozens of questions about where and how he's been and why he left.`
	"CN-12135" `	Elliot introduces you to his family, who thank you for bringing Elliot home. Victor, who was only seven years old when Elliot left and is now twelve, asks you question after question about being a pilot, sometimes asking new questions before you can even answer the old one.`
	"CN-12136" `	"Are you going back to the spaceport, <first>?" the taxi driver yells from the driveway. "I need to get back to the city as soon as I can."`
	"CN-12137" `	You say goodbye to Elliot and to his family. "Thanks again, <first>," Elliot says. "I'll always owe you."`
	"CN-12138" `The "Check Cargo" light for your ship begins blinking when you land, meaning that a cargo crate may have come loose in flight. You shut off the ship's engines and walk to the cargo hold.`
	"CN-12139" `	You check every cargo crate in the hold, but can't find anything wrong. Right as you decide to leave, one of the smaller crates begins rocking back and forth.`
	"CN-12140" `	You hear a voice come from the crate, but it is not a language you understand. The voice continues to speak, and you recognize it as the Hai language.`
	"CN-12141" `	You open the crate and are met face to face with a Hai child. You aren't sure how old they are, but they look to be about the size of a one-year-old human child. They try to communicate with you, but begins to cry when they see the confused look on your face.`
	"CN-12142" `	"Don't cry, little guy."`
	"CN-12143" `	(Pick up the Hai.)`
	"CN-12144" `	The child waves its hands around when you try to pick them up, making it impossible to grab on to. After waiting for a few minutes, the child finally calms down, eventually going to sleep in the crate.`
	"CN-12145" `	The child begins to cry even louder than before. After waiting for a few minutes, the child finally calms down, eventually going to sleep in the crate.`
	"CN-12146" `	You hear a voice come from the crate, and surprisingly your Hai translator begins speaking. "Let me out! I want to go home!"`
	"CN-12147" `	You open the crate and are met eye to eye with a Hai child. You aren't sure how old they are, but it looks to be about the size of a one-year-old human child. "I want my mommy!" they say as its eyes begin to tear up.`
	"CN-12148" `	"Where's your mommy?"`
	"CN-12149" `	The child looks surprised when your translation device speaks to them in Hai. "Take me home!" they yell back at you. You attempt to find out where the child's home is, but they continue to cry for its mother without giving any important information.`
	"CN-12150" `	This child must have somehow gotten into your cargo hold while you were in Hai space. Leaving a Hai child on this world would be an extremely bad idea. Perhaps someone on <destination> will be able to bring the child back to its family.`
	"CN-12151" `Walking through the <origin> spaceport, you notice that almost half of the people you see are humans, unlike other Hai worlds where the Hai outnumber humans by a sizable degree. A human dressed in a business suit shouts your name from across the street and approaches you.`
	"CN-12152" `	"Captain <last>, one of the many heroes of humanity! I noticed you right away when I laid my eyes upon you. I'd like to personally thank you for what you've done."`
	"CN-12153" `	"Glad to get some recognition for all the hard work I've done."`
	"CN-12154" `	"Don't mention it. I just did what I could to help."`
	"CN-12155" `	"Can I help you, sir?"`
	"CN-12156" `	"I'm the one who should be using formal titles to address you, so please, Captain, don't call me sir.`
	"CN-12157" `	"A personality as big as yourself should be receiving praise and recognition wherever you go! People must really have no respect these days.`
	"CN-12158" `	"No need to downplay yourself, Captain! You've done excellent work in saving humanity from that alien scourge.`
	"CN-12159" `	"The name's David Joseph Turner, venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and famous Paradise Worlds businessman." Turner grabs a business card from his pocket and hands it to you. The card contains his contact information, an address on Martini, and makes sure to boast in golden letters his net worth of more than three billion credits.`
	"CN-12160" `	"You may not have heard of me, but I've definitely heard of you, and I'd like to make a proposition to you." Turner turns around and waves his arm across the crowd of people in the spaceport. "You see all the humans here? About one out of every four of these people only arrived here through the wormhole after the war broke out. Captains who knew of the Hai came flocking here in droves after the Navy entered Kornephoros, hoping to avoid any troubles that the war would bring. Some captains returned after the war ended, but most stayed, and I see a massive market opportunity in that."`
	"CN-12161" `	"Captain <last>, fantastic to see you again! I noticed you right away when I laid my eyes upon you and I must say, I'd like to thank you again for what you've done."`
	"CN-12162" `	The man is David Turner, who was involved in the movie production during the Hai crisis. Almost reflexively he goes to grab a business card from his pocket but then seems to remember and puts it back away. Seems to be exactly the same card as last time though.`
	"CN-12163" `	"Now Captain, if you have a moment, I'd like to make a proposition to you." Turner turns around and waves his arm across the crowd of people in the spaceport. "You see all the humans here? About one out of every four of these people only arrived here after war broke out through the wormhole. Captains who knew of the Hai came flocking here in droves after the Navy entered Kornephoros, hoping to avoid any troubles that the war would bring. Some captains returned after the war ended, but most stayed, and I see a massive market opportunity in that."`
	"CN-12164" `	"What kind of market opportunity?"`
	"CN-12165" `	"Sorry, but I don't have the time to talk about this."`
	"CN-12166" `	"You're only worth three billion credits? Why shouldn't I pursue your opportunity on my own?"`
	"CN-12167" `	"Of course you're worth more than me, Captain <last>, but you are no business owner. I have the connections and skills, but a name like yours will always help.`
	"CN-12168" `	You try to walk away, but Turner stops you by grabbing your arm and continues to talk.`
	"CN-12169" `	"Allow me to explain. The journey to the Hai can be a dangerous one, even with the new commitment to safety made by both governments. I heard many stories during the war of merchants trying to reach the Hai, but thanks to the Navy being distracted, those merchants fell victim to pirates patrolling the systems of the Far North. Even now, those pirates roam almost unchallenged, and many merchants are trapped here without the means to safely return. They expended most, if not all, of their ammunition trying to get here, and now they have none to defend them on their way back. Human ammunition has become a scarce commodity among human captains in this region of space, leaving open a market that's just waiting to be cornered.`
	"CN-12170" `	"Allow me to explain. The journey to the Hai can be a dangerous one, and you know that. I heard many stories during the war of merchants trying to reach the Hai, but thanks to the Navy being distracted, those merchants fell victim to pirates patrolling the systems of the Far North. Now that many merchants are here, they're trapped. They expended most of if not all of their ammunition trying to get here, and now they have none to defend them on their way back. Human ammunition has become a scarce commodity among human captains in this region of space, leaving open a market that's just waiting to be cornered.`
	"CN-12171" `	"I'd like you, Captain <last>, hero of humanity, to help me set up an outfitter here on <origin>, an outfitter that would supply these desperate merchants with relief by supplying them with the ammunition they need, along with outfits they might want to buy for their old ships. I've already received approval from the Hai government for the construction of an outfitter, and with a name like yours backing up this business, the profits are sure to be phenomenal, profits that you would be sharing in by being a founding member of this outfitter."`
	"CN-12172" `	"This sounds like a good idea to me. What do you need me to do?"`
	"CN-12173" `	"Sorry, but I'm not interested in your proposition."`
	"CN-12174" `	"Nonsense, Captain! All you'd need to do is help escort a few freighters from <planet> to Follower and back to here, and for so simple a job you could be receiving enough money to not work another day in your life, or perhaps even support a massive fleet."`
	"CN-12175" `	"Again, I'm not interested. Goodbye."`
	"CN-12176" `	"Alright, you have my attention."`
	"CN-12177" `	"Well, I tried, Captain," Turner says with a smirk. "I'll just have to travel back to the Paradise Worlds and make my money in other areas of business, then." He hands you another business card and winks. "Goodbye, Captain <last>. You should know where to find me if you need me. Perhaps we can pursue this venture together in the future."`
	"CN-12178" `	"Excellent, Captain! I'll be making myself comfy on my own ship. A convoy of freighters is waiting for us on <destination>. From there, we're off to Follower to pick up supplies."`
	"CN-12179" `Turner jumps off of his Star Queen before the boarding ramp fully reaches the ground, clearly eager to get moving with this project.`
	"CN-12180" `	Turner swears under his breath when he walks up to you. "Low life pirates giving us trouble on the way here. That's the kind of trouble I'm talking about that an outfitter in Hai space would help with. There's no telling what would have happened had my Bulk Freighters not had their missiles. Or if you were not there to protect them, of course."`
	"CN-12181" `	Turner has a talk with the spaceport authorities, and within a short amount of time the necessary cargo is loaded on to the freighters. When the freighters are fully loaded, they take off without even giving you time to get to your ship.`
	"CN-12182" `	"With their ammunition restocked they can get back to Greenwater on their own," Turner says from behind you as you watch the freighters fly off. "I told them to leave as soon as they could. As for you and me, I need an escort to <destination>. I received a message from an old friend there who would like to have a chat with me."`
	"CN-12183" `Turner lands his ship outside of the Kraz Cybernetics building. "Wait here while I have a talk with my friend, Edward. This should only take a few minutes."`
	"CN-12184" `	A few hours later, Turner returns carrying a black suitcase. "Sorry, that took longer than I expected. Now, let's get back to <destination>."`
	"CN-12185" `By the time you finally reach <planet>, construction on the outfitter is already underway. The construction workers have laid the foundation of the outfitter close to the spaceport, taking up a good portion of a park.`
	"CN-12186" `	"I had to pay a pretty penny to get the outfitter this close to the spaceport," Turner says to you, "but it'll all be worth it in the end. The outfitter should be done in three months or so. You'll know it's done once you find an extra two thousand credits in your pocket every day."`
	"CN-12187" `	Turner pats you on the back. "Have fun until then, Captain <last>. Keep yourself busy saving the galaxy."`
	"CN-12188" `Turner meets you in a high-end human-owned restaurant in the richer part of the city, very much reminiscent of something you would find on a Paradise Planet. "It's been quite some time since we last spoke, Captain <last>. Over a year now," he says. "Have you been enjoying the extra cash in your pocket every day, Captain <last>?"`
	"CN-12189" `	"Yes. It's been a huge help paying crew salaries."`
	"CN-12190" `	"Two thousand credits each day isn't much for me."`
	"CN-12191" `	"I suppose two thousand credits every day wouldn't be much to a hero such as yourself. Spaceships are expensive, after all. How does four thousand credits every day sound to you?"`
	"CN-12192" `	"I'm glad to hear that, Captain <last>. I spent my early years as a captain myself, and I didn't much enjoy having to worry about crew salaries every day. Perhaps doubling that amount will help even more."`
	"CN-12193" `	"Am I getting a raise?"`
	"CN-12194" `	"Is this part of your new proposition?"`
	"CN-12195" `	"You could call it that," Turner says after sipping from his glass of wine.`
	"CN-12196" `	"Building an outfitter selling human goods here on <origin> has had to be the best idea I've ever had, Captain <last>, but recently I thought of an even better idea. You see, most of the humans you see flying around in Hai space are flying decades-old ships. Hai ships are prohibitively expensive for humans. The Hai sell the Aphid for nearly one and a half million credits! This means that demand for ships is extremely high among humans, Captain <last>. Do you see where I'm going with this? You look at something we humans sell like a Star Barge, which is hardly worse than an Aphid for only a quarter of the price, and you start to see the problem."`
	"CN-12197" `	"You need me to help you escort freighters again?"`
	"CN-12198" `	"Do you want to build a shipyard selling human ships?"`
	"CN-12199" `	"Yes, Captain. Right now, the only realistic way that a human born here can get a ship is if they know a captain willing to retire. Even then, prices for a human ship can be more than twice what they are across the wormhole. You'd think they could just get passage and buy a human ship over there, but those banks just don't recognize credit histories from this side. It's preposterous, Captain <last>!`
	"CN-12200" `	"I've already made arrangements with the local Hai government. The rest of the park next to the outfitter is now my property, and I intend to use it to build the shipyard. I've also contacted Megaparsec and bought a license to build their ships and some of the outfits they sell on <planet>. My freighters are at the ready in the spaceport right now. All I need you to do is escort them to <destination> and back, and in six to seven months' time when the shipyard is done, you'll reap the rewards. What do you say, Captain <last>? Do you want to be a hero to millions once again?"`
	"CN-12201" `	"Sure, this sounds like a great idea."`
	"CN-12202" `	"I'm not interested in working with you anymore, Turner."`
	"CN-12203" `	Turner smirks at your response. "Understood, Captain <last>. I'll just save myself two thousand credits a day from now on by rescinding your salary. I'll be seeing myself out now."`
	"CN-12204" `	"Wait! I changed my mind. I'll help you."`
	"CN-12205" `	"Excellent decision, Captain <last>. I'll meet you outside to send the ships off."`
	"CN-12206" `	Construction on the shipyard begins almost immediately after the supplies are unloaded from the freighters, starting with the demolition of the rest of the park. A downtrodden-looking crowd gathers to watch the demolition, but Turner assures you that there are plenty of other parks in the city for them to go to.`
	"CN-12207" `	"Something big is going to come of this, Captain <last>," Turner says. "Just know that you were all part of it. You'll know the shipyard is done when you find an extra four thousand credits in your pocket each day. Goodbye until then, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-12208" `While eating in a spaceport cafeteria that serves both Hai and human cuisine, you are approached by a teenage human and Hai. "Hello. Do you know how to get to <destination>?" the Hai asks.`
	"CN-12209" `	"I do. Why do you want to go there?"`
	"CN-12210" `	"I don't. You'll have to ask someone else."`
	"CN-12211" `	The human responds, "There's a massive convention on <planet> for a game called 'Boundless Frontiers.' The convention has a huge cosplaying scene, and I think Kiru would fit right in."`
	"CN-12212" `	The human responds, "There's a massive convention on <planet> for a game called 'Boundless Frontiers.' Now that Kiru doesn't have to worry about pretending to be a cosplayer the whole time, we're really keen to go."`
	"CN-12213" `	"Arthur and I have <payment> to give you if you bring us to the <planet>," Kiru says. "We can find our own way back to the Hai space, as well."`
	"CN-12214" `	"Alright, I can take you there."`
	"CN-12215" `	"Sorry, you'll have to find someone else to bring you."`
	"CN-12216" `You hop around the spaceport of <origin>, trying to adjust to the low gravity of this moon, when you are approached by a toweringly tall human woman and an equally tall Hai male who are clearly having no trouble with <origin>'s gravity.`
	"CN-12217" `	"You look like you need help there, Captain," the woman says with a chuckle.`
	"CN-12218" `	"Don't worry. I almost have the hang of it."`
	"CN-12219" `	"Maybe a little bit."`
	"CN-12220" `	"It's always fun watching captains when they step off the comfort of their ship," the Hai says.`
	"CN-12221" `	"At least they're trying, Touhar," the woman says.`
	"CN-12222" `	"Can I help you two with something?"`
	"CN-12223" `	"Is there something I can help you with, or are you just going to watch me?"`
	"CN-12224" `	"Actually, there is something," the woman says. "My name is Anaya, and this is my husband, Touhar. And you are?"`
	"CN-12225" `	"My name is <first> <last>."`
	"CN-12226" `	"Wait, your husband?"`
	"CN-12227" `	"Very nice to meet you, Captain <last>," Touhar says to you.`
	"CN-12228" `	"What, you've never seen an interspecies couple before?" Touhar asks with a hint of sarcasm in his voice.`
	"CN-12229" `	"We got married last week, and we were hoping to travel to <destination> for our honeymoon. I know it's risky to bring Touhar into human space, but <planet> is a sparsely inhabited world, and I have a friend who owns a house in the mountains far from anyone who could see him."`
	"CN-12230" `	"We got married last week, and we were hoping to travel to <destination> for our honeymoon. Some people still tell us it's risky to bring Touhar into human space, especially to such a sparsely inhabited world as <planet>, but I have a friend who owns a house in the mountains, and it just seems like everything is working out so well right now."`
	"CN-12231" `	"Said friend will be able to arrange for our return to <origin> as well," Touhar adds. "Will you take us?"`
	"CN-12232" `	"Sorry, I can't travel that far from here."`
	"CN-12233" `As you are making your way through the spaceport you notice a worried-looking Hai staring at the local job board and back at some sort of document they are holding.`
	"CN-12234" `	(Approach the Hai.)`
	"CN-12235" `	(Leave them alone.)`
	"CN-12236" `	The Hai is a bit startled, but quickly calms down. "Sorry, you caught me by surprise. I've just bought my first ship and need to find some jobs to do, but nobody I've talked to wants to trust a beginner captain. I just don't know what to do anymore, I've been working for so long to qualify for this loan, but I'm running out of time and I'll never be able to pay it like this."`
	"CN-12237" `	Turns out the documents she is holding are the bank papers for the loan, somewhat similar to the one you took when you bought your first ship. You've come a long way since your days as a beginner, and know how hard it is to be starting out as a starship captain; you could probably convince someone here to offer a simple cargo job to this young Hai.`
	"CN-12238" `	"If you're interested, I could try to help you find a job."`
	"CN-12239" `	"I've been there before; trust me, it gets better. I wish you the best of luck on finding a job."`
	"CN-12240" `	She nods in sad understanding, and continues to swap focus from the job board to the papers in her hand.`
	"CN-12241" `	(Help her out anyway.)`
	"CN-12242" `	(Leave her alone and continue on.)`
	"CN-12243" `	Her ears twitch a bit, and her previously crestfallen eyes light up as she nearly jumps in joy at your offer. "Thank you so much Captain! My name is Nanachi, I promise I won't cause any trouble at all, just a few quick jobs and I'm sure I'll be fine by myself!"`
	"CN-12244" `	You introduce yourself to Nanachi and shake her paw. "Can you show me your ship so I can look for jobs it's best suited for?" you ask.`
	"CN-12245" `	She hesitates a bit, but leads you to her ship. You were expecting a small Hai ship, but to your surprise she shows you a rather beat-up Heavy Shuttle docked near your own ship.`
	"CN-12246" `	"You took a loan to buy a human ship?" you ask.`
	"CN-12247" `	She looks at the ground, as if ashamed of it. "It'd take way too long for me to qualify for a loan for even an Aphid, but I recently met a human merchant who wanted to sell his old ship; it was difficult, but I managed to convince him to sell it to me instead of going to the shipyard office. I paid him its full price, but even for this one I had to take out the biggest loan I could. Its cargo hold isn't very impressive but it has more bunks than our smallest ships, if that helps."`
	"CN-12248" `	"Let's see if anyone in the spaceport needs a lift off the planet."`
	"CN-12249" `	"Let's take another look at the job board, maybe a smaller job will pop up."`
	"CN-12250" `	Turns out this isn't as easy as you thought it'd be. The spaceport is almost empty, save for the occasional worker or drunken crew member, and the job board is filled with massive hauls of minerals, aside from a few small but dangerous jobs to human space. Eventually, as you two begin scouting the edge of the docking area, you spot a troubled human merchant near several crates. You approach him and he explains that his ship had some malfunctions and he cannot deliver his cargo of advanced surgical equipment to <destination>. "This is the worst! One jump away from the planet and the navigation system suddenly decides to go on strike! There's no way I can make it before the deadline!"`
	"CN-12251" `	"My friend Nanachi here could deliver it for you. We were heading there anyway; a few extra crates won't make a difference," you say, trying to sound as convincing as possible.`
	"CN-12252" `	At first, he seems delighted that you two want to help him, but when Nanachi mentions that she's flying a Heavy Shuttle, he frowns, and looks back at the cargo. "Unfettered attacks make it so they need tons of medical supplies on <planet>, and quite frankly I'm not comfortable letting such a fragile ship go into dangerous territory carrying this equipment when it could be blasted to bits in an instant," he says. The captain glances around the deserted spaceport for a while, as if trying to find some other captain, before finally turning to Nanachi and saying, "but I guess beggars can't be choosers. Fine, I'll let you take the cargo there, but please be very careful."`
	"CN-12253" `Shortly after her ship lands, you meet up with Nanachi, who is doing her best to hide her excitement at being on another planet for the first time, and is gawking at some Hai military ships in particular. "So, how did you like your first time doing a hyperspace jump?" you ask, to try and snap her out of it.`
	"CN-12254" `	"Oh um, I don't think I'll get used to the feeling anytime soon. I threw up a lot so I'm glad this wasn't a job with passengers. I've always dreamt of being on other worlds, exploring and learning everything about them. I'm glad I'm finally able to do it."`
	"CN-12255" `	You help her get the crates out of the cargo hold and contact the client. Nanachi's share of the payment is small, as the client transfers most of the money to the merchant she got the job from, but that doesn't make her any less excited about getting her first paycheck.`
	"CN-12256" `	"So, want to go to the spaceport and try to get a job on your own? I'll help you again in case you can't do it yet." you say.`
	"CN-12257" `	"Just give me an hour or two to explore. Back home our shipyard is kind of small. I've never really gotten a chance to see a Shield Beetle up close, and there are many undergoing repairs here. I'll just go get a better look at them, I swear I'll be quick."`
	"CN-12258" `	You two agree to meet in the spaceport in a few hours; maybe this time she will do fine on her own.`
	"CN-12259" `You meet up with Nanachi in the spaceport, give her some tips to try and persuade someone into hiring her, and tell her you'll be nearby if she still has trouble getting a job. You watch her go around the spaceport and approach some groups of humans and even other Hai to no avail. Maybe since this is a world seeing combat often, they're too busy with military related activities to help a new pilot. She manages to grab the attention of a Hai family leaving a restaurant carrying way too much luggage, most likely tourists looking for a ride back home. Everything seems to be going well until the parents start to look worried. It seems as if they might go away if you don't step in.`
	"CN-12260" `	You walk over to the group to help her, and get a better look at the family: a Hai couple carrying a baby, and three older children who aren't doing much to help their father carry their ludicrous number of bags.`
	"CN-12261" `	"Hey, what's going on?"`
	"CN-12262" `	"Can I be of assistance?"`
	"CN-12263" `	You introduce yourself and the parents tell you that they've been on vacation here and need transport back to <destination>. "Don't take this the wrong way, but Captain Nanachi told us her ship is one of your human ships, a Heavy Shuttle was it? It has enough bunks for us but our sons already caused a ruckus on the way here in a Hai ship, we're worried that since they aren't used to the accommodations, they might end up giving her too much trouble."`
	"CN-12264" `	You reassure them that the trip will be very quick, and that the ship's interior is somewhat similar to that of Hai ships, until they finally agree on traveling with her. They settle on the pay and the two of you help the Hai get their baggage to Nanachi's ship. When the family is focused on a conversation, you quietly ask Nanachi what the issue she was having with the other people she encountered.`
	"CN-12265" `	"They all seemed willing to give me a job, but I ended up blowing it when I asked for more money. I just really need to get out of debt so I guess I went a bit overboard." She tries to play it cool, but it's clear that she is embarrassed about losing so many potential jobs. When you reach her ship, you take a look at the prices for commodities in <system>. You decide to tell Nanachi to stock up on heavy metals to sell there, to help her make a bit more profit.`
	"CN-12266" `You help the family gather all their luggage and bid them farewell, but right as they disappear into a hallway Nanachi lets out a heavy sigh. "I bit off more than I could chew. Those kids kept wanting to play with the ship's controls, and one of them tried to go up the air vent in a game of hide-and-seek. I couldn't get any rest since I had to keep making sure they weren't about to dump their own bags into the void by accident."`
	"CN-12267" `	"Do you want to get some sleep before trying to find another mission?" you ask, hoping she won't try to overwork herself.`
	"CN-12268" `	"Yes, I could really use that. Sorry to make you wait again Captain <last>. I'll rest a bit, see if I can't find a spot nearby to relax, and meet up with you in the spaceport after a while."`
	"CN-12269" `You send a message to Nanachi and you two meet up in the spaceport. You're still walking toward the job board, when she asks: "Back home I heard stories about how humans have a much larger population than the Hai, and that their home planet has even more people than Hai-home. Is it true that there are many other human worlds with spaceports this large?" You name her a few human planets that are extremely populous, and how even some planets with fewer people than this world have incredibly large spaceports.`
	"CN-12270" `	While you tell her stories of many different planets you've visited, she seems to be particularly interested in Earth. "I've seen a bit of human architecture in videos of planets like Allhome, but I can't even imagine what your capital must look like. Tens of thousands of years of another species' history, it sounds even more exciting than what I heard about our landmarks on Hai-home. Captain, do you think that someday, when we no longer need to be kept hidden from humanity, that I'll be able to visit Earth, and see the beauty of your capital?" Seeing how little she knows about humanity, it's not surprising that she is unaware of the state that Earth is in.`
	"CN-12271" `	While you tell her stories of many different planets you've visited, she seems to be particularly interested in Earth. "I've seen a bit of human architecture in videos of planets like Allhome, but I can't even imagine what your capital must look like. Tens of thousands of years of another species' history, it sounds even more exciting than what I heard about our landmarks on Hai-home. Captain, do you think that someday, when I have a bigger ship or when the routes are safer, that I'll be able to visit Earth, and see the beauty of your capital?" Seeing how little she knows about humanity, it's not surprising that she is unaware of the state that Earth is in.`
	"CN-12272" `	"I've never actually been to Earth before, so I couldn't tell you what it's like."`
	"CN-12273" `	"Earth is a beautiful place, so it would be nice if you could see it."`
	"CN-12274" `	"Earth isn't actually that great a place to visit. Most of its inhabitants would take any chance they're given to leave it."`
	"CN-12275" `	"Oh, sorry about that, shouldn't have assumed you knew everything, you're a starship captain after all, not a historian, I'll just ask someone else when I get the chance," says Nanachi.`
	"CN-12276" `	You start making up stories about how beautiful the skies of Earth are. You describe forests teeming with life, and do your best to remember ancient civilizations and their monuments. From the looks of it she believes you, and your lie seems to have sated her curiosity for now. If the day where the Hai are allowed to move around human space ever comes, though, she will no doubt be extremely disappointed.`
	"CN-12277" `	You start making up stories about how beautiful the skies of Earth are. You describe forests teeming with life, and do your best to remember ancient civilizations and their monuments. From the looks of it she believes you, and your lie seems to have sated her curiosity for now. If she does manage to be successful enough to fly to Earth one day, though, she will no doubt be extremely disappointed.`
	"CN-12278" `	She looks at you in confusion, as if trying to understand what you mean, so you explain it to her. "Despite how much humanity has advanced in the past centuries, Earth has been largely neglected. Most of the land has been turned into cities, which have over the years decayed into slums. If you ever managed to visit you'd be better off going to museums or monuments, but even then there are many thieves roaming the streets and it is very dangerous to be out at night. Lots of folks born there just think about how to get out."`
	"CN-12279" `	You keep telling her about the issues facing humanity's birthplace, and her previous eagerness to learn about the planet fades. "How could your ancestors let their own home become like this?"`
	"CN-12280" `	"Long-term planning has never been a strong trait of humanity as a whole."`
	"CN-12281" `	"I guess it isn't too unlike how the Unfettered have treated their worlds."`
	"CN-12282" `	Nanachi looks confused, so you continue to elaborate on that idea. "They're expecting to be able to have new worlds soon, so they consider the decay of their current ones as acceptable losses. Humans have also had issues with long-term planning and preparing for adverse events."`
	"CN-12283" `	"I see..." She says. "I just thought it would be fun to hear about another large planet like Hai-home. Sorry for asking about it, Captain, I'm sure having to speak of it wasn't a pleasant feeling."`
	"CN-12284" `	Although you're sure that even in Hai space there is social inequality, she probably can't fathom that the home planet of a species could be in such bad shape, considering the Hai even go as far as to send aid to the Unfettered on a regular basis.`
	"CN-12285" `	You two reach the job board and decide to start looking for jobs suited for Nanachi's ship.`
	"CN-12286" `	"So, do you mind if I help out? I know the job board can be confusing the first few times you check it."`
	"CN-12287" `	"Do you think you need me to help out this time?"`
	"CN-12288" `	"Thanks, but I have to do this on my own. I promise I won't mess this up by getting greedy again." She approaches the board on her own, and it becomes clear that it's much easier to get a job here; she's barely started talking to one of the desk workers before receiving a long list of jobs for smaller ships. She is certainly still very tired, but this seems to have cheered her up a bit; it is the first time she can get a job without your help, after all.`
	"CN-12289" `	While you thought she would've picked one or two jobs quickly and headed back to her ship, she keeps going through them and double checking the information for each one, as if something about them bothers her.`
	"CN-12290" `	"What's wrong? Are you struggling to pick between two different jobs?" you ask.`
	"CN-12291" `	"These all seem very easy and I could even accept many at a time, but the problem is their pay isn't very good." She grabs some worn papers from her pocket, and shows it to you: they're the documents for her loan. "The bank back home would only give me enough for the ship if I agreed on a short-term loan. I lost two days before you came along to help me, and if I don't get some better paying job soon, I won't even be able to pay the interest."`
	"CN-12292" `	As you're trying to figure out a way to get the most out of the available missions, you feel a tap on your shoulder, and turn to see a Hai standing beside a human couple. The couple introduce themselves as Xavier and Vanessa, who are here with their Hai friend Narancia. "We overheard your conversation and are willing to pay a little extra for a job. We're part of a group organizing a big festival in Allhome to celebrate the friendship between humans and Hai, and we just got a last-minute idea: we'd like to get our hands on some Quarg spices."`
	"CN-12293" `	Nanachi perks up during their conversation. "I'm sure I can get the spices to <planet> within two weeks. I won't let you down!"`
	"CN-12294" `	"That's wonderful," Narancia says. They tell Nanachi that they won't be going along; they already have a transport to Allhome, and will stay here a bit longer to try and advertise the event. "Just come to Allhome after you've picked up the spices. Safe travels!"`
	"CN-12295" `A spaceport worker contacted Nanachi shortly before you two landed and made sure the spices were ready to be loaded in her ship. You help the workers and Nanachi make sure everything is in order, and prepare for your trip to Allhome.`
	"CN-12296" `Allhome's docking area shows much more traffic than usual. Many captains here are helping workers open cargo containers full of food, clothes, books, movies and even some mounted animals from human space. You finally meet up with the festival's organizers, who seem very excited to have acquired the exotic condiments, and have invited you two to a bar in the spaceport for a drink.`
	"CN-12297" `The bar is just as busy as the docks. Many captains here must have transported something for the festival. "Captain <last>, Captain Nanachi!" shouts Narancia, beckoning the two of you to join her and the others at their table. You learn that they were inspired by the Hai's own March festival, and wanted to bring small parts of human culture to Hai space.`
	"CN-12298" `	"They can't go to our planets and experience it for themselves yet, so we thought about bringing it to them!" Vanessa says.`
	"CN-12299" `	"It's still quite an expensive ordeal to go to our planets and experience it for themselves, so we thought about bringing it to them!" Vanessa says.`
	"CN-12300" `	"It was very hard to get enough sponsors for this, but after years of hard work we even managed to have famous art pieces be brought here, some of which date back to the European Renaissance!" Xavier adds.`
	"CN-12301" `	Afterwards the conversation topic shifts to you as a captain, as you describe your journey after buying your first ship, and how you met Nanachi. You're about to order another drink for the group when a grizzled old man barges into the bar, and starts shouting: "The art convoy has been attacked! The freighter managed to escape but they're stranded on Prime now, and the pirates are still out there, patrolling the route to the wormhole!"`
	"CN-12302" `	Xavier stands up with a shocked expression. "How? We had a Leviathan escorting them!"`
	"CN-12303" `	After catching his breath, the man at the door responds. "The pirates must have been stealing Hai tech from ships going back home. The freighter's captain said they shredded the escort!" Chaos spreads amongst the other captains, and the group sitting with you is in anguish.`
	"CN-12304" `	"Are those art pieces really that valuable?"`
	"CN-12305" `	"Can't you just postpone the festival until the pirates are taken care of?"`
	"CN-12306" `	Xavier collapses back to the table, holding his head in both hands. "Those paintings and sculptures were our main attraction! They're worth tens of billions! It'll take months before the Navy ever notices the pirates there and makes it safe for the convoy to come here. The art exhibition is scheduled three weeks from now!"`
	"CN-12307" `	As they try to figure out what to do, Nanachi speaks up. "I'll go there. I pilot a human ship and if we just need to transfer cargo from one ship to the other, I could get out of there quickly. Nobody would notice that a Hai ever went there."`
	"CN-12308" `	Xavier collapses back to the table, holding his head in both hands. "Those paintings and sculptures were our main attraction! They're worth tens of billions! Even if we contact the Navy it will take weeks before they can mobilize to hunt them down and guarantee that they've made it safe for the convoy to come here, and the hazard pay to request a carrier escort is frankly ridiculous. The art exhibition is scheduled for only three weeks from now!"`
	"CN-12309" `	Some of them eye you as they try to figure out what to do, but Nanachi speaks up before any well-formed ideas are reached, "I'll go there. I pilot a human ship and if we just need to transfer cargo from one ship to the other, I could get out of there quickly. It's not an impressive ship either, so it's much more likely to go unnoticed or uncared for."`
	"CN-12310" `	"Are you insane?" Vanessa says, "If they managed to take down that Leviathan, you wouldn't last a second! Besides, our convoy was extremely fast. If even they were caught, your chances of outrunning the pirates are next to nothing!"`
	"CN-12311" `	"Captain <last>," Nanachi turns to you. "I know you already helped me way more than anyone would ever be willing to, and I'm really grateful for that, but would you be willing to help me one last time, to get to that planet, and travel back here?"`
	"CN-12312" `	It's certain that for a pirate fleet to take down a Leviathan so easily they must be incredibly powerful, and this could be extremely dangerous. You're sure that if Nanachi tries to get to Prime by herself she'll just get herself killed.`
	"CN-12313" `	"Alright, I'll make sure we reach Prime and get back here safely."`
	"CN-12314" `	"No, I agreed to help you find and deal with some simple jobs, but I can't risk fighting such a fleet by myself."`
	"CN-12315" `	She thanks you profusely, and promises that she'll pay you for everything as soon as she can. The organizers are a bit hesitant, but seeing as no other captain here has decided to offer them help, they agree to let the two of you go to Prime and retrieve the cargo.`
	"CN-12316" `	Vanessa grabs ahold of Nanachi's arm before she can run off to the spaceport. "Just remember, if you can't get back here by <day>, don't worry about it; we'll understand. I'm sure we can come up with some alternative to have the festival without our main attractions."`
	"CN-12317" `	As you're leaving the bar, Xavier pulls you aside, speaking very quietly, "<last>, I know you're just trying to help this girl, but don't get killed over this. If you run into those pirates don't try to fight them, just rush to Prime."`
	"CN-12318" `	As you're leaving the bar, Xavier pulls you aside, speaking very quietly. "<last>, I know you're no stranger to combat and danger, but don't get killed over this. The girl won't know what's sensible for her if it gets hairy, and she shouldn't have to get killed over this. If you run into those pirates don't try to fight them, just rush her through. I have faith in a person such as yourself."`
	"CN-12319" `The convoy's captain messaged you as you entered the system and told you to land on a remote, hidden area of Prime, where they have already prepared for all the cargo to be transferred. They refuel your ships and urge you two to go back. "Captain Nanachi can stay hidden with us here if you need supplies or anything from the outfitter, but please don't take too long."`
	"CN-12320" `Landing back on Allhome, the festival group gives you and Nanachi a warm hug. "We sold tens of thousands of tickets for the festival by promising to host a great art exhibition with pieces from all over human space. Without them it'd be a complete failure, and we'd be in serious trouble with our sponsors," Narancia explains.`
	"CN-12321" `	As the cargo is rushed to the exhibition site, Nanachi shows you the chip she got as payment, and the balance of her bank account: this last payment allowed her to fully pay off her loan. "Captain," she speaks with some difficulty, and tries to hide her face, as if to wipe away some tears. "I'll never be able to thank you properly, if not for you I'd still be lost in that spaceport, and would eventually have to go back to my mining job. I'll work hard now; I'll save up and pay you for everything!" She hugs you and bows to you in a way you'd see in movies, as if trying to imitate the gesture. You two finally say goodbye, and head back to your ships.`
	"CN-12322" `Shortly after you land, you get a message from Nanachi, the young Hai pilot who you helped start out. "Dear Captain <last>, I hope you're doing well! As I promised, ever since we parted ways, I've been working towards getting enough money to pay you for being so kind to help me. I've sent you <payment>. I'm deeply grateful to you for helping make my dream come true."`
	"CN-12323" `After you leave your ship and start making your way through the docking area, you notice a Hai running towards you and waving. As they get closer, you realize that it's Nanachi, the Hai pilot who you helped out years ago.`
	"CN-12324" `	"I was just about to go back to my crew when I saw you coming out of your ship. I know a nice snack bar here, let's go there!" Before you can even say hello, she's dragged you to the bar, and ordered some drinks for the two of you. She tells you about her last few years as a captain. She has long since sold her old ship, and now pilots a Geocoris, transporting large amounts of cargo across Hai space. You also tell her about how your life has been ever since you last met, of your adventures and how far you've come. You keep swapping stories for hours, until the bar is ready to close.`
	"CN-12325" `	You thank her for the drinks, and get ready to say your goodbyes.`
	"CN-12326" `	"Oh wait, before you go Captain, let me give you something," she says, right as you're about to head to your ship. She grabs a small pendant from her pocket.`
	"CN-12327" `	"Back home in Giverstone, when I had some free time from the mining works, I took a hobby of sculpting some small stones into ship miniatures. I thought it'd be nice to make one for you, in case I ever saw you again. I made it from the same stones we use as good luck charms on our ships." She gives you the pendant, which has been sculpted into a Hai Shield Beetle. It is extremely well made, with different surface textures representing the different parts of the Shield Beetle. "I wanted it to be something to make your travels easier, the way you helped with starting mine. Thanks again, Captain!" You two part ways, and head back to your ships.`
	"CN-12328" `You've returned to <origin>, but you don't have access to any hull repair technology. Explore the galaxy and earn the trust of an alien faction that has hull repair technology before returning.`
	"CN-12329" `You've returned to <origin> to help the Hai develop hull repair technology. Osen's father asked if you knew of any aliens with hull repair technology, and you have met the Coalition, who have outfits capable of repairing hulls, and the Remnant, who have ships that repair themselves. Would you like to tell the elders about one of these groups?`
	"CN-12330" `You've returned to <origin> to help the Hai develop hull repair technology. Osen's father asked if you knew of any aliens with hull repair technology, and you have met the Coalition, who have outfits capable of repairing hulls. Would you like to tell the elders about the Coalition?`
	"CN-12331" `You've returned to <origin> to help the Hai develop hull repair technology. Osen's father asked if you knew of any aliens with hull repair technology, and you have met the Remnant, who have ships that repair themselves. Would you like to tell the elders about the Remnant?`
	"CN-12332" `	You inform the elders that you have discovered a group that could help them with creating hull repair technology, and they invite you to the council chamber. "Greetings, Captain <last>," one of the elders says to you upon entering the chamber. "What news do you have to bring us on your search for hull repair technology?"`
	"CN-12333" `	"There is a group of three alien species far from here known as the Coalition that have outfits able to repair a ship in flight."`
	"CN-12334" `	"There is a group of humans far from here known as the Remnant who have ships that can repair themselves."`
	"CN-12335" `	"A group of humans with hull repair technology?" one of the elders asks with a puzzled look. "I am surprised that we have not heard of these humans before. Are they well known among the Republic?"`
	"CN-12336" `	"No," you explain. "They are a reclusive group unknown to most of humanity. They likely wouldn't take kindly to being visited by aliens."`
	"CN-12337" `	"A group of three aliens?" one of the elders asks with a puzzled look. "It is not often in the galaxy that such groups appear."`
	"CN-12338" `	"We will put together a delegation for you to transport to these people you mention. They will be waiting for you on <destination>," another elder says. "You may lead them to make contact with this group how you see fit. We trust that you will be capable in doing so."`
	"CN-12339" `You find the Hai delegation meant to travel to the Remnant to negotiate for the hull repair technology waiting for you in the spaceport. The leader of the delegation introduces herself as Ambassador Yashili. "I heard that we will be traveling a great distance across the galaxy. May we have a safe journey."`
	"CN-12340" `	The delegation begins making their way to your ship, but you stop them.`
	"CN-12341" `	"Wait a minute! This group doesn't react well to strangers. How about I set up a meeting first?"`
	"CN-12342" `	"Not so fast. The Remnant value their secrecy, and I haven't spoken to them about this situation. Let me set up a meeting first."`
	"CN-12343" `	The Hai look at each other and chatter quietly among themselves, then Ambassador Yashili speaks up. "You know this group, and how to make the best impression on them." She pauses to whisper to another Hai, who runs off. The Ambassador turns back to you. "I will provide you with a letter that will include a brief introduction of the Hai, an explanation of why we would like to meet them, and an invitation to establish diplomatic relations."`
	"CN-12344" `	Moments later, the Hai who ran off returns carrying a sealed envelope and hands it to the Ambassador. She turns to you. "Here it is. Please take this to these reclusive humans for us. We will be waiting here for your return."`
	"CN-12345" `	"Will do," you respond after taking the envelope. The delegation says its goodbyes, wishing you safe travels, before leaving.`
	"CN-12346" `Looking around the spaceport, you are not sure who to talk to about such a diplomatic request. Eventually, you go to the starport information desk to ask them. You hand the letter to the person at the desk, and after reading it, they invite you to wait in the cafeteria while they look for someone who can fulfill the request from the Hai.`
	"CN-12347" `	After an hour of watching Remnant eating and gesturing to each other, an androgynous Remnant approaches your table. You try to guess what age they are, but while they do not seem young, neither do they seem particularly old.`
	"CN-12348" `	"Greetings, Captain <first>," The stranger signs. "My name is Rayn, and my colleague said you had a request from another faction. It is my understanding that they desire the means to repair the hull of a ship in flight. Is this correct?"`
	"CN-12349" `	"Yes. The Hai are hoping to be able to improve a new carrier they are developing to repair its drones."`
	"CN-12350" `	"Yes. The Hai want to be able to repair the hulls of their ships to gain an edge against their enemies."`
	"CN-12351" `	"So the Hai want to improve their military technology? I presume this is in response to their long-standing war against the Unfettered?"`
	"CN-12352" `	"Yes, although they don't think of it as such."`
	"CN-12353" `	"It isn't a war; it's a defensive action."`
	"CN-12354" `	Rayn looks amused. "It does not matter what they call it. A war by any name is just as bloody. But that aside, how do they know about us to make such a request?"`
	"CN-12355" `	"They were looking for someone who had repair technology, and I said I could find someone."`
	"CN-12356" `	"They asked if I knew anyone who had in-flight repair technology, and I said I knew a group of human researchers."`
	"CN-12357" `	"So they do not actually know about us. That is good." Rayn looks thoughtful and closes their eyes for a moment, then continues. "Pick up the Hai diplomats, but do not tell them where you are going. Take them to these coordinates on Covert in the Gienah system. It is a location in an uninhabited area where we will be able to talk. We will be waiting with something that might be able to help them - if they can meet our price."`
	"CN-12358" `You message Ambassador Yashili and tell her that you have arranged a meeting with the Remnant. "This is good news. We will be meeting with you in the spaceport shortly."`
	"CN-12359" `	Some time later the delegation arrives at your ship. "Before we leave, is there anything we need to know about this group before we meet them?" Yashili asks.`
	"CN-12360" `	"The Remnant are a group of humans, so there isn't anything special you should need to know."`
	"CN-12361" `	"The Remnant agreed to meet you on <planet>, a dangerous pirate world, so don't stray too far from the ship."`
	"CN-12362" `	"Oh," Yashili exclaims with a surprised look. "Are these Remnant also dangerous people?"`
	"CN-12363" `	"No, they're friendly people," you reassure her. "They just don't want to meet in their own territory."`
	"CN-12364" `	The delegation thanks you for this information and boards your ship. You plot a course for <destination>. Hopefully, the Remnant will be willing to share with an alien species they just met.`
	"CN-12365" `At the designated coordinates, there is a small encampment set up that looks vaguely reminiscent of a desert trader outpost. Aside from a few camels tied near a water trough, the place looks abandoned. When you touch down next to it, the delegation steps out cautiously. "Is this the right place?" one of the Hai asks somewhat worriedly.`
	"CN-12366" `	Before you can answer, a number of Remnant emerge from the tents, and you notice that Rayn is among them. "Welcome to our encampment, representatives," Rayn chants. "Captain <first> brought us your missive, and we asked them to bring you here. Would you care to come inside?" They gesture toward the largest of the tents. While obviously surprised, Ambassador Yashili acquiesces, and the Hai step inside. Rayn gestures for you to follow. The remaining Remnant begin patrolling around the camp.`
	"CN-12367" `	Rayn offers food and water to the Hai and then takes a seat on a cushion on the ground. The Hai politely refuse the food before joining Rayn on the cushions. Ambassador Yashili begins. "We come representing the Hai people, who live far from here. Some of our brothers and sisters have turned violent toward us, and have recently created a new ship that may cause us trouble. We have created a ship of our own in retaliation, but we are still in need of technology capable of repairing the hull of a ship while in flight so that we may have an advantage. Captain <last> has told us that you have such technology, with ship hulls that repair themselves."`
	"CN-12368" `	"It is true that our ships self repair," Rayn responds. "But this is not technology that we are able to share. The property is intrinsic to the metals that we build our ships with - metals which are in low supply." Yashili looks concerned with this development; perhaps this journey was a worthless one.`
	"CN-12369" `	"So is there no way that you can help them?"`
	"CN-12370" `	"There must be something we could do."`
	"CN-12371" `	"Do not fear, for we have something else. For many decades, we have been fighting and plundering Korath raiders from the Core. Their ships contain outfits capable of hull repair through the use of small robots. We have been unable to reproduce these robots with ease, but we may be able to provide for you our research and a number of samples that you may use."`
	"CN-12372" `	"We too have encountered these Korath," Yashili says in response. "Although, we had not taken their technology. This may be of great use to us."`
	"CN-12373" `	"We would like to ask something in trade, however: a copy of your astronomical records. The history of the galaxy itself is a mystery to us, and we would like to learn more about it."`
	"CN-12374" `	Ambassador Yashili looks thoughtful, then nods. "Historical astronomical data is scientifically valuable, as is learning how to repair our ships in flight. This seems a fair trade. We should be able to have the data for you shortly. We only need use of Captain <first>'s ship to access the hyperspace communication relays." Yashili nods to another member of the delegation, who then scurries off to your ship.`
	"CN-12375" `	"I imagine there will be a large amount of data to transfer," Rayn says. "Let us pass the time."`
	"CN-12376" `	Ambassador Yashili and Rayn settle into diplomatic small talk. The conversational dance between a group of professional diplomats and a secretive group that are currently playing the role of nomadic desert traders is an odd one.`
	"CN-12377" `	"While we wait, I am curious how you met these Remnant, Captain," Yashili says.`
	"CN-12378" `	"I spend much of my time exploring the galaxy. Sometimes you stumble upon interesting things."`
	"CN-12379" `	"Well, the same way I'd imagine most people found you - by just wandering aimlessly."`
	"CN-12380" `	Yashili nods. "This is an understandable situation."`
	"CN-12381" `	An hour of conversation later, the Ambassador's assistant returns with a large data drive and hands it to her. The Remnant pull out a data chip of their own, and the two groups formally exchange the data. In response to an unseen signal, another Remnant pulls back one side of the tent, and a team carries in a segment from a systems core with several of the small robots. "There are more of these waiting outside, but here is a sample for you to inspect. Using the instructions we have provided, you should have no problem making use of this technology." They poke at the console, and the robots promptly spring to life and assemble a small pile of parts into a model ship.`
	"CN-12382" `	"Thank you for doing business with us," says Ambassador Yashili. "You have a friend in the Hai." She bows and the Remnant return the bow with fluid grace before quickly shouldering the Korath equipment. They load everything onto the <ship> as the delegation boards, and you set out to return to <planet>.`
	"CN-12383" `	As you take off, a final glance at your exterior cameras shows the Remnant have already almost finished packing up their encampment onto the camels. As one tent comes down, it reveals an anti-aircraft artillery cannon installed on a sled. Despite the rustic appearance they portrayed, the Remnant certainly took their security seriously. There is still no ship visible, but you suspect that a Starling or Gull is undoubtedly hiding nearby.`
	"CN-12384" `You find the Hai delegation meant to travel to the Coalition to negotiate for the hull repair technology waiting for you in the spaceport. The leader of the delegation introduces herself as Ambassador Yashili. "I heard that we will be traveling a great distance across the galaxy. May we have a safe journey."`
	"CN-12385" `	"Is there anything that we should know about this Coalition before meeting them?" another member of the delegation asks.`
	"CN-12386" `	"The Coalition are a group of three species that live in harmony, just like the humans and Hai here. They should enjoy meeting new aliens."`
	"CN-12387" `	"The Coalition hate the Quarg and went to war with them many millennia ago in order to drive them out of their space."`
	"CN-12388" `	"That is most concerning," Yashili says with nods of agreement from the other two members of the delegation. "Hopefully the presence of the Quarg in Hai space will be of no issue to them." Yashili thinks for a moment. "Or perhaps we could use this information to our advantage."`
	"CN-12389" `	The delegation gathers their things and boards your ship, and you plot a course for <destination>. Hopefully the Coalition will be willing to share with an alien species they just met.`
	"CN-12390" `Before landing, you notify the Heliarch that you're bringing alien ambassadors to meet with them, and sure enough a Heliarch delegation is waiting for you when you land. They briefly salute you, but appear to be much more interested in the strange new beings you've brought to their center of government.`
	"CN-12391" `	The Hai delegation is momentarily confused by the unusual speech pattern the Coalition species have, but snap out of it shortly. The Heliarch then start explaining their story to the Hai, the same they told you when you first met them, including their warning about the Quarg. While both delegations are engaged in conversation, a Heliarch agent approaches you, asking, "To this precious encounter, with what purpose have you brought these people, Captain?"`
	"CN-12392" `	"They're in need of your help."`
	"CN-12393" `	"They come seeking technology."`
	"CN-12394" `	You start talking to them about the Hai and their conflict with the Unfettered, but as you're explaining you hear a loud collective gasp coming from the Heliarchs that are conversing with the Hai. A member of the Heliarch delegation approaches you. "Captain <last>, kindly telling us about their territory and society, your friend Yashili has. Truthful, is it, that close to the Hai planets, a ringworld the Quarg have constructed?"`
	"CN-12395" `	The others seem to be in an excited conversation of their own, after changing their translation devices to no longer speak human. Yashili and the other Hai also turn to you, looking somewhat confused, waiting for you to respond for them.`
	"CN-12396" `	"The Quarg are indeed there, but they stay out of Hai business, and the Hai stay out of theirs."`
	"CN-12397" `	"Yes, the Quarg have a single system there with a complete ringworld, where many Hai and even some humans also live."`
	"CN-12398" `	The Heliarchs speak among themselves at a rapid pace, and before you know it several dozen other agents are around. One of them, an older Saryd with a golden circlet, says, "Tell us more about this ringworld, you must, Hai friends. Accompany us, would you?"`
	"CN-12399" `	Without waiting for the Hai delegation to answer, they practically drag them to a restricted section of the ringworld without you. About an hour later, the Hai are brought back, most with tired expressions.`
	"CN-12400" `	"Had I known we would be interrogated on the engineering aspects and the inner workings of a ringworld, I would have had an engineer come with us," Yashili whispers to you.`
	"CN-12401" `	The Heliarchs once again warn the Hai to be careful with the Quarg before finally letting the Hai explain the reason for their trip here.`
	"CN-12402" `	The delegation still looks a bit overwhelmed, as if still processing all the history the Heliarch just told them, but Yashili has kept her composure and begins speaking. "We come representing the Hai people, who live far from here. Some of our brothers and sisters have turned violent toward us, and have recently created a new ship that may cause us trouble. We have created a ship of our own in retaliation, but we are still in need of technology capable of repairing the hull of a ship while in flight so that we may have an advantage. Captain <last> has told us that you possess such technology."`
	"CN-12403" `	"Developed such technology, indeed we have," an Arach agent responds. "Composed of several dozens of small repair bots, and their center of command, such outfits are."`
	"CN-12404" `	"So are you willing to give or sell one of those outfits to the Hai?"`
	"CN-12405" `	"Would you share the way of mass-producing those outfits with the Hai?"`
	"CN-12406" `	"Much involved in projecting our repair modules, House Chamgar is," the same Arach says. "Contact their representatives in this ring, we will."`
	"CN-12407" `	"Do you desire anything in return?" Yashili asks the agent.`
	"CN-12408" `	"In return, we ask nothing. Helping you extend beyond the limits placed upon you by the Quarg, enough of a reward is," the Arach responds. Yashili looks somewhat puzzled, but does not press the issue any further.`
	"CN-12409" `	A short time later, a group of Arachi representing House Chamgar arrive. They have the Hai describe their ships, using this information to optimize the repair module for Hai ships. They then prepare a copy of the blueprints, handing a data chip containing the schematics for the hull repair modules and their hull-walking robots to the Hai. Some workers then load a crate with two small modules onto your ship for the Hai to use as examples. Yashili thanks the Coalition for their generosity and boards your ship, ready to return to <destination>.`
	"CN-12410" `"Baellie" Atomic Engines`
	"CN-12411" `Yashili contacts the elders as you land, informing them that you have obtained the hull repair technology. They agree to meet you in the spaceport along with Osen. A group of spaceport workers begins unloading the samples from your cargo bay after you land.`
	"CN-12412" `	As you depart your ship, you spot the Hai elders and Osen approaching. Ambassador Yashili and the Hai delegation step forward to meet them.`
	"CN-12413" `	"I hope the Remnant treated you well," one of the elders says.`
	"CN-12414" `	"They were an interesting group. Very reclusive, and not willing to share much of their people, but they were more than willing to help after we provided them with a copy of our historical astronomical data."`
	"CN-12415" `	"I hope the Coalition treated you well," one of the elders says.`
	"CN-12416" `	"They were an interesting group. Very enthusiastic about meeting new people, although very touchy on the subject of the Quarg."`
	"CN-12417" `	Yashili then hands the copy of the data to Osen. "You'll be needing this," she says.`
	"CN-12418" `	"And I'll certainly love it," Osen responds. "The spaceport workers have already sent the cargo en route to my shipyard. I'll begin working on implementing it into the Pond Strider immediately."`
	"CN-12419" `	"Pond Strider?"`
	"CN-12420" `	"I hope you have fun with that."`
	"CN-12421" `	"Yes. That is the name that we settled on for the ship, and its drones will be named the Flea."`
	"CN-12422" `	"I'm getting itchy just thinking about it," one of the elders jokes.`
	"CN-12423" `	"It's hard not to have fun when you love doing your job."`
	"CN-12424" `	Osen is about to run off, but one of the elders stops him. "Can you give us any estimate on how long it will take to make use of this data?"`
	"CN-12425" `	"Oh, yes," Osen says. "It may take us a few months to get everything working. A single month at the least if we are lucky."`
	"CN-12426" `	"This is good to know. The sooner we have these ships functional, the better."`
	"CN-12427" `	Osen once again gets ready to run off, but this time stops himself and turns to you. "Thank you Captain. Without this information, it could have taken me years to finish this project." You nod in response, and Osen finally runs off to his shipyard.`
	"CN-12428" `	"I would like to thank you as well," Yashili says. "It has been some time since I have had the chance to leave our space. It is always exciting to go to new places and meet new people." Yashili bows to you, and you return a bow of your own.`
	"CN-12429" `	"And we also need to express our gratitude," one of the elders says. "It is good to have you as a friend of the Hai. We shall keep you no longer, though. May you stay safe on your adventures."`
	"CN-12430" `Upon landing on <planet>, you receive a message from Osen. "Hello Captain <last>! I hope this message finds you well. I would like to once again thank you for your help on the Pond Strider, and would like to inform you that we have finished implementing the hull repair technology that you have provided us into the Pond Strider design and have now begun producing the ship on a mass scale. You'll also be interested to find that we have developed new weaponry for the Pond Strider's drone, the Flea. I won't spoil the surprise for you though. Check the shipyard on Hai-home the next time you stop by to take a look at it."`
	"CN-12431" `A rapid tapping on your shoulder dissipates any intentions you might have had about touring this spaceport in peace. You turn around to find a Hai, short even by their standards, looking up at you.`
	"CN-12432" `	"You're a ship captain, yes? Would you like to be part of cinema history?" she asks.`
	"CN-12433" `	"I'm not much of a movie buff. I'll pass."`
	"CN-12434" `	"Sure, what do you need me to do?"`
	"CN-12435" `	"My name is Likeet, and I'm the director of an independent film production. We need you to bring <bunks> crew members and <tons> of film equipment to <planet>, then bring us back after about a month. We can pay you <payment>, but the immaterial rewards of being involved in an ambitious project such as this will be priceless."`
	"CN-12436" `	"Why would you want to film in <planet>? Isn't that an abandoned station?"`
	"CN-12437" `	"What's so special about <planet> for filming?"`
	"CN-12438" `	"I'm not going that way. You'll need to find some other captain."`
	"CN-12439" `	"Ah, you must not know about <planet>. There are many tales which swirl around the station, chief among them being the existence of ghosts and monsters haunting its corridors. We'd like to take advantage of the popular image of <planet> in the creation of our horror film by using it as a backdrop. It's sort of the human equivalent of setting your film in a 'haunted' forest. Don't worry, we'll bring enough food to last us for the month."`
	"CN-12440" `	"Why do people think it's haunted?"`
	"CN-12441" `	"Alright then, I can take you there."`
	"CN-12442" `	"Back when the station was still in use, there was a mysterious malfunction in one of the hatches which released oxygen out the airlock. Hundreds on board suffocated to death. To this day, no one knows what caused it, and legends have grown out of the event."`
	"CN-12443" `	"What makes you think I'm parking my ship at a haunted station?"`
	"CN-12444" `	Likeet gives a laugh. "It's not actually haunted, of course. Those are just stories. Do you think I'd send an entire film crew and all their expensive equipment to a place that was actually dangerous?"`
	"CN-12445" `	"Excellent! I'll let the crew know where to find you."`
	"CN-12446" `You help your passengers unload all of their film equipment once you arrive on <planet>. The props seem to get more and more elaborate as they are unpacked from your ship; you note the presence of countless rubber limbs, mechanical monsters, and cans of fake blood being carried onto the set. Once you are finished, Likeet approaches you.`
	"CN-12447" `	"What's your movie about, anyways?"`
	"CN-12448" `	"I better get going, then."`
	"CN-12449" `	"I don't want to spoil anything, but it's a psychological horror film that explores the nature of isolation, and the shadow that our own mortality casts over our lives." She continues to elaborate on more philosophical themes that seemingly have less and less to do with the actual film, until she notices that your eyes have long since glazed over.`
	"CN-12450" `	"Well, anyways, thanks for your help, Captain. I'll contact you in a month once we're finished filming," says Likeet.`
	"CN-12451" `	"Thanks for your help, Captain. I'll contact you in a month once we're finished," says Likeet.`
	"CN-12452" `Upon landing your ship you receive a voice call. Although the sender didn't bother to identify themselves, you soon recognize it as the voice of Likeet, the movie director that you brought to Darkrest a month ago.`
	"CN-12453" `	"Captain <last>! Good to see you again! We've finished filming here and need a ride off this place. I'll see you soon." Before you can say anything, she hangs up.`
	"CN-12454" `The first thing you notice when you land on Darkrest is the mess. It looks as if a tornado has touched down on the set, and you don't remember Likeet talking about natural disasters when she described the movie.`
	"CN-12455" `	"Controlled chaos, I call it," says Likeet, who has somehow materialized beside you. "We're just clearing everything out right now, making sure we didn't forget anything, the usual."`
	"CN-12456" `	It takes a few hours to load everything onto your ship. Once you're finished, the only sign that anyone was here is that the station's surfaces are free of dust.`
	"CN-12457" `	"Alright, Captain. We'll need to get to <planet> so that we can edit the raw footage in our studio. Gonna be nice to finally be back on a planet instead of this tin can." She pauses, as if she's trying to remember a line. "Oh yeah, I'll pay you <payment> once we've arrived. Let's get out of here."`
	"CN-12458" `When you land on <planet>, you are approached by Likeet, who is carrying a large can of fake blood. "Thanks for the ride, Captain. Keep a lookout for my film in theaters. You'll know it when you see it." Once the cargo has been unloaded, she almost sprints away in excitement, no doubt trying to make it to her studio as quickly as possible. You notice that <payment> have been deposited into your account.`
	"CN-12459" `It is a sunny afternoon as you idly walk through the spaceport alone, until you somehow find yourself surrounded by a group of young humans and Hai.`
	"CN-12460" `	"You're a spaceship captain, right? Could you take us to <planet>?" says one of the Hai, as if he had practiced this line for a while now.`
	"CN-12461" `	The human next to him gives him a nudge. "Don't forget to ask for a trip back, Tagreep, unless you want to be stranded there."`
	"CN-12462" `	"What would you want to do on <planet>? Isn't that an abandoned station?"`
	"CN-12463" `	"Sure, I can take you there and back."`
	"CN-12464" `	"Sorry, I'm busy right now. Go ask some other captain."`
	"CN-12465" `	The group starts to shuffle around with a nervous air. "Well, we're still in school, so money's kind of tight right now... but we can pay you!" Tagreep pauses to glance at his friends and, in almost a whisper, says, "Is <payment> okay?"`
	"CN-12466" `	"Why would you want to pay money to go to <planet>, anyhow? Isn't that an abandoned station?"`
	"CN-12467" `	"Sure, I'm not hurting for cash right now."`
	"CN-12468" `	"No way, that's too low. Find someone else."`
	"CN-12469" `	"Well, that's kind of why we want to go there," says another one of the Hai. "Some guy in our dorm told us that there's ghosts haunting <planet>, and we wanted to call his bluff."`
	"CN-12470" `	"Some guy in our dorm told us that there's ghosts haunting <planet>," says another one of the Hai, "and we wanted to call his bluff."`
	"CN-12471" `	"We're planning to look around for an afternoon, see what we can find," one of the human students says, grinning. "Once we're done we'll let you know, and then we can leave."`
	"CN-12472" `	One of the shorter Hai in the back pipes up. "I brought cameras for the trip!" He is ignored by the rest of the group.`
	"CN-12473" `	"Is this legal?"`
	"CN-12474" `	"Not my business where you spend your vacations. Come aboard."`
	"CN-12475" `	The students look at each other, considering this question for what is apparently the first time. "We've heard of other people going there with no problems, as long as they were... discreet about it," says one of the students, trying to assure both you and their fellow classmates. Another mentions having heard something about needing a permit to enter, but he is quickly shushed by the rest of the group.`
	"CN-12476" `	"I'm not about to risk getting in trouble for this. Find someone else."`
	"CN-12477" `	"If anyone asks, I'll say I didn't know a permit was needed. Come aboard."`
	"CN-12478" `	The students race onboard your ship. As they settle into their bunks, you can hear them speculating about what they will find on <planet>.`
	"CN-12479" `Your passengers' journey mainly consisted of trying to scare each other by telling ghost stories and jumping out of dimly-lit corners of your ship. Despite these annoyances, you land at the station with no issues. Your passengers practically jump off your ship after hastily paying you <payment>.`
	"CN-12480" `	After passing the time in your ship for a few hours, you are startled by a loudspeaker sternly pronouncing something in Hai. You then notice your passengers rushing towards your ship with a panicked look in their eyes. You imagine that they want to take advantage of that return trip you promised as soon as possible; however, disassociating yourself from them may save you some trouble with law enforcement.`
	"CN-12481" `	(Wait for my passengers.)`
	"CN-12482" `	(Bail.)`
	"CN-12483" `	You take off just before your passengers are able to reach your ship. Their wailing is quickly drowned out by the sound of your engines as you maneuver out of the station.`
	"CN-12484" `	The station is bathed in a garish orange light and the booming voice continues to play. Your red-faced passengers rush back onto your ship shouting at each other in a mixture of languages, and once they're through the airlock you take off before something worse happens.`
	"CN-12485" `Upon landing, you are accosted by the local police on <planet>.`
	"CN-12486" `	"Captain <last>?" says a Hai officer. "Could you come with me for a moment?"`
	"CN-12487" `	"Am I in trouble?"`
	"CN-12488" `	"I'm innocent!"`
	"CN-12489" `	Almost as soon as you turn around to run you feel a sharp pain in your side as your consciousness fades away.`
	"CN-12490" `	You look up, lying in the spot you just stood. Above you is the same officer which asked you to follow him, waving off another officer with a Pulse Rifle. Apparently you were not out for long.`
	"CN-12491" `	"We just want to let you know what happened," the officer says. He leads you away from your passengers, who are currently being examined by a medic for any potential injuries, and sits you down at a table nearby.`
	"CN-12492" `	"I think you can tell by now that your passengers weren't exactly 'sanctioned visitors' to Darkrest. However, they didn't break anything - that announcement you heard was just a warning to refrain from touching a computer system without proper training, but it apparently spooked your passengers enough that they made a run for it. They're not in trouble, as there's no law against just wandering around a station as long as you're not destructive, but typically people who do so get permission first." He give a wry smile. "Saves us from having to deal with false alarms like this."`
	"CN-12493" `	"So, am I in trouble or not?"`
	"CN-12494" `	"Are my passengers going to be okay?"`
	"CN-12495" `	"Yeah, they're fine. We're basically just here to make sure they didn't injure themselves. Don't imagine that their parents are going to be too thrilled with them, though.`
	"CN-12496" `	"Simply bringing a paying passenger somewhere they requested to go isn't illegal. Your passengers were of age and knew what they were getting into, and you weren't deliberately enabling them to break the law. You're fine."`
	"CN-12497" `	The officer gets up. "Next time though, you should probably think twice before bringing some college kids somewhere to go 'ghost-hunting.'" He chuckles as he leaves.`
	"CN-12498" `Upon landing, you are accosted by the local police on <origin>. Behind your ship, you see your passengers disembarking from another Hai ship. Some of them are red-faced and crying, but they appear uninjured.`
	"CN-12499" `	You can clearly tell that the officer has little patience for your questions. He leads you away from your passengers, who are currently being examined by a medic for any potential injuries.`
	"CN-12500" `	You can clearly tell that the officer has little patience for your antics. He leads you away from your passengers, who are currently being examined by a medic for any potential injuries.`
	"CN-12501" `	"You are being fined <fine> for abandoning your passengers without warning. You're lucky you didn't end up with a more serious punishment." After further chewing you out for endangering your passengers' safety, he walks away from you in a huff.`
	"CN-12502" `It is an unusually foggy day on <origin>; the air is so thick with moisture that you cannot see more than a few paces in front of you. Perhaps that's why you're so startled when you turn around and see a Hai standing right next to you. He is so close you can see dewdrops on his whiskers, and you immediately notice the prominent jewelry that he is wearing. He appears to be quite old, judging by his stooped-over posture and the white fur around his muzzle.`
	"CN-12503" `	"I see that you are wiser than most humans here," he says, pointing toward your ship. Its hatch is open, prominently displaying your keystone to any potential travelers. "You carry a shield against the tempest of space. Let no one else tell you otherwise." He pauses to take a breath. "Now, onto more worldly things. My name is Hareek. Are you willing and able to take me to <destination> for <payment>?"`
	"CN-12504" `	"The keystone you carry is a strange one, human," he says, pointing toward your ship. Its hatch is open, prominently displaying your Key Stone to any potential travelers. He walks up to it to get a closer look. "Very unusual. No proper mounting either - must be a human design." He sighs. "Well, at least the keystone itself looks authentic. It will have to do." He turns to you. "You carry a shield against the tempest of space. Let no one else tell you otherwise. If your people have access to keystones as well, then I hope they too become wise to its power and learn to treat them with more reverence. Now, onto more worldly things. My name is Hareek. Are you willing and able to take me to <destination> for <payment>?"`
	"CN-12505" `	"A unique design you have here, Captain," he says, pointing toward your ship. Its hatch is open, prominently displaying Nanachi's pendant to any potential travelers. "A gift, I presume? You are lucky you have someone looking out for you. You carry a shield against the tempest of space. Let no one else tell you otherwise." He pauses to take a breath. "Now, onto more worldly things. My name is Hareek. Are you willing and able to take me to <destination> for <payment>?"`
	"CN-12506" `	"I've never seen anything like this... thing you have," he says, pointing toward your ship. Its hatch is open, prominently displaying the Tree Skeleton Key Stone to any potential travelers. The Hai sounds more than a little disgusted. "I hope you haven't done anything you'll regret."`
	"CN-12507" `	He takes a closer look. "It seems to be made out of the same material as a keystone, and yet it is entirely foreign to me. Where you got this, I have no idea. Well, at least the material itself looks authentic. It will have to do." He sighs and turns to you. "I suspect that whoever you got this from is not happy it is out of their hands. I would show more respect for keystones if I were you." He pauses to take a breath. "Now, onto more worldly things. My name is Hareek. Are you willing and able to take me to <destination> for <payment>?"`
	"CN-12508" `	"Why would you want to go to <destination>? Isn't that an Unfettered planet?"`
	"CN-12509" `	"I'm not going there. You'll have to ask someone else."`
	"CN-12510" `	The Hai pauses for a moment, as if unsure of what to say. "My teachings and prophecies are more... appreciated among our northern brethren."`
	"CN-12511" `	"Teachings?"`
	"CN-12512" `	"Unfettered space is too dangerous for me. You'll have to find someone else."`
	"CN-12513" `	An unreadable expression appears on Hareek's face. "Ah, apologies for my rudeness - you probably do not know who I am. How do I explain this... You have your preachers and wise ones among the humans, yes? I am something similar. Now, will you take me to <destination>?"`
	"CN-12514" `	"So you're going to preach to the Unfettered?"`
	"CN-12515" `	"I can take you."`
	"CN-12516" `	"That is an oversimplification, but it is not something I can explain adequately to a human." He turns away, looking into the fog. "There are portentous events occurring in the galaxy, and I must warn others of the turmoil I have foreseen. The Unfettered crave turmoil, so naturally they are more inclined to believe me." He gives a wry smile.`
	"CN-12517" `	"Sorry, but this whole thing sounds a little too strange for me."`
	"CN-12518" `	He snorts. "Dangerous? I am approaching 300 years of age, and yet I do not fear a trip to Unfettered space." He walks away, clearly disappointed.`
	"CN-12519" `	He sighs. "That's alright. I would not expect you to understand." He walks away, disappearing into the mist.`
	"CN-12520" `	"Excellent. Arriving in a human ship would be an auspicious start to my journey, but there are not many human captains who take proper precautions when traveling through space. I'm glad to see that you have some sense, at least." He lowers his voice.`
	"CN-12521" `	"Since you seem to be a trustworthy captain, I will tell you of some things I have seen. Many years ago, I defended our space against the Korath raids. One day, we were caught unprepared and hit by a massive fleet. Every single ship in my patrol group was destroyed, except for ours - the only one with a keystone. I learned two things in my time against the Korath: that the old legends are true, and that the stability we have enjoyed as a species is ending. Changes in the galaxy are inevitable, and those changes are arriving soon." He begins to move toward your ship. "But let us not speak of this now. I have business to attend to."`
	"CN-12522" `Hareek was quite tight-lipped about what he planned to do once on <planet>. The most you could get out of him was more stories about his past as a military pilot. Once you land, Hareek jumps off your ship, moving surprisingly fast for his age.`
	"CN-12523" `"Thank you, Captain, for making this journey. I apologize for not telling you more about me; the work I do is not something that I can reveal to any human who asks." He hands you <payment> and moves away. The surrounding Unfettered appear almost awed by his presence and consequentially give you a wide berth.`
	"CN-12524" `As you pass by a kitchen supply store in the spaceport, a dishevelled elderly Hai looks towards you with a face of deep concern. She waves you down.`
	"CN-12525" `	(See what she wants.)`
	"CN-12526" `	"My name is Eeeya, and I'm looking for my lost granddaughter, Anoo. She just passed the medical school, and I was going to give her three tons of cookies, but she's gone! Please help me find her." Her soft voice has a chittering edge much stronger than other Hai you've spoken with. She also hesitates before certain words, as if unsure which article to add, giving her speech a unusual rhythm.`
	"CN-12527" `	"So please, take me to find my granddaughter."`
	"CN-12528" `	"Three tons of cookies!?"`
	"CN-12529" `	"She's gone?"`
	"CN-12530" `	"Why don't you ask the authorities for help?"`
	"CN-12531" `	"Can't your friends help you find her?"`
	"CN-12532" `	"Let's go find her!"`
	"CN-12533" `	"I have other places to be."`
	"CN-12534" `	"Well, I... I don't know... I cook when I'm worried, and Anoo has been missing for three months! I've sealed all three tons of cookies. They should last a year or two. Maybe she'll share them with her friends? She has many friends! Tons of friends! They all miss her, but none are willing to help...`
	"CN-12535" `	"Anoo passed medical school on the Frostmark four months ago, near the top of her class! A famous hospital on the Hai-home needed a new trauma surgeon and said she would be perfect for the job. She accepted the position and said she would be on vacation for a few weeks.`
	"CN-12536" `	"A month later, she told them she won't be coming, and nobody has heard from her since.`
	"CN-12537" `	"I talked to the Central Medical Bureau, and they told me she got approval for practicing medicine anywhere in Hai space or beyond. They've heard nothing from her since she got approval. She has to register new medicines with the Bureau, so they should have heard from her.`
	"CN-12538" `	"The police told me that several other people have reported Anoo missing, but they refused to tell me anything else. They said I had to talk to military, but they won't tell me anything.`
	"CN-12539" `	"Maybe she's involved in something secret? Or illegal? No, she'd never do that. Where is she?`
	"CN-12540" `	"I have few friends, and none of them are interested in finding a missing Hai who could be anywhere. None of my customers want to help either, and her family is all dead.`
	"CN-12541" `	"She always talked about doing free work for those who couldn't afford medical treatment. When she was little, her mother would take her to Stonebreak to help at local shelters. Let's start there."`
	"CN-12542" `You spend several hours flying Eeeya between the massive communities of Stonebreak. She checks every homeless shelter, volunteer ward, women's shelter, and low-income hospital. The story is always the same: Anoo hasn't been seen in years, though some remember the energetic little girl in her youth before her mother left.`
	"CN-12543" `	After a few moments of crushing despair, Eeeya's ears perk up, and she says, "Since it's clear she's not here, let's check on <destination> - she could be in military."`
	"CN-12544" `Eeeya takes you to the visitor's office and asks to see the Cloudfire military commander. Upon refusal, Eeeya throws a fit; after an hour of her panic they agree to let her speak with the commander.`
	"CN-12545" `	After a few minutes, she comes back looking despondent, and you lead her back to <ship>.`
	"CN-12546" `	"They said she doesn't work for them. I think they know where she is, but they won't tell me anything.`
	"CN-12547" `	"There's one more place we can try, but I don't think you're going to like it. She may have joined Unfettered Hai."`
	"CN-12548" `	"Why didn't you mention this earlier?"`
	"CN-12549" `	"Why would a doctor join a band of warmongers?"`
	"CN-12550" `	"As the honorable Captain <first> <last>, I say let's go find her!"`
	"CN-12551" `	"Unfettered space is too dangerous for me. You will have to find another captain."`
	"CN-12552" `	"I was afraid it would scare you away. Humans are scared of our ships, and the Unfettered are deadly warriors. Besides, the other places were more likely. Many of her mother's family have joined the Unfettered in the past, but I didn't think that would happen to her."`
	"CN-12553" `	"Anoo was always sympathetic to the cause of the Unfettered Hai. Not their pointless war - she hated that - but she respected their drive to progress and their gift for change. Her father's family tried to stop her ideas, and we thought we succeeded, but... maybe...`
	"CN-12554" `	"A trauma surgeon for the Unfettered Hai? I wonder if she planned this the years in advance?"`
	"CN-12555" `	"If Anoo went anywhere, it would be the Darkcloak. The largest Unfettered hospital is there. Many soldiers come back from raids injured on Darkcloak. A trauma surgeon would have a lot of work to do."`
	"CN-12556" `You're ushered from the landing platform to a nearby hospital, where Eeeya finally manages to convey your intent. A few Unfettered Hai nearby are muttering in their language, and you keep hearing the Hai word for "cookies" as they watch Eeeya. Along the way, you notice an odd contrast of squalor and advanced machinery. Unlike their southern brethren, it seems the Unfettered value function and progress over aesthetics and comfort.`
	"CN-12557" `	As you rise through the main tower of the hospital, you're surprised at how advanced it is. Despite their willingness to die in battle, the Unfettered seem to value the lives of the survivors. Perhaps this hospital is to heal them quickly so that they can fight again as soon as possible.`
	"CN-12558" `	You reach a high floor filled with personal offices. Eeeya knocks on each door, apologizing when the Unfettered inside aren't who she's looking for, until you finally reach the very last room.`
	"CN-12559" `	Eeeya opens this door, and runs to the Hai inside it - Anoo. They begin to speak in Hai, then remember that you are in the room.`
	"CN-12560" `	"Please, Anoo, let's speak in the human language. <first> came all this way for me, and it's only fair that Captain be able to understand what's going on."`
	"CN-12561" `	The conversation then turns to Anoo's new occupation.`
	"CN-12562" `	"Why did you come here, Anoo? The Unfettered hate us."`
	"CN-12563" `	"They don't hate us in particular, grandma. They hate what we've become: frivolous, uninventive, and self-important. Our species is fading into history through a slow death of mediocrity. Most Unfettered see warfare as our only salvation.`
	"CN-12564" `	"We think of them as mindless brutes, but they're not! They have scientists, doctors, musicians, and writers. Our resources dwarf theirs, but they thrive with what little they have. Soon the Unfettered will have many more planets and almost unlimited resources. The era of scarcity will be over, and they'll have the power to choose their future.`
	"CN-12565" `	"If enough good people join the Unfettered, we can change their minds and set them on a more productive path. They'll need good doctors."`
	"CN-12566" `	"But-" Eeeya objects.`
	"CN-12567" `	"Anoo is right; the Unfettered are a noble people. I would recommend joining them."`
	"CN-12568" `	"There's no good reason to join the Unfettered. What have they ever done except kill innocent Hai?"`
	"CN-12569" `	"Well... I really don't know..."`
	"CN-12570" `	"Never mind, you're right. Joining the Unfettered is a bad idea after all."`
	"CN-12571" `	"I stand by their guns. The Unfettered are honorable."`
	"CN-12572" `	"I'm sorry, Anoo, but I really think the Captain <first> is right. I'm not the kind of person to be friendly with a group who starves and yet paints such a romantic picture of itself. And in addition, I doubt there would be a way to support a family of two here; nuts by themselves are costly enough, let alone cookies. The hospital work here can only pay so much.`
	"CN-12573" `	"Captain, could you take me back to the <planet> please? I'd like to sign the forms and give you some stock in my Acorn Delights factory. In the meantime, here is <payment> for what you've done so far."`
	"CN-12574" `	"I'd be glad to take you back."`
	"CN-12575" `	"I'll take you, but I'll notice that you haven't mentioned what we came so far for."`
	"CN-12576" `	Eeeya smiles at her granddaughter. "Before I leave, I was just reminded about a present I have for you." She leads you and Anoo back to <ship>. "Captain, could you open the cargo hold and take us inside?" Anoo is astonished at the tons of acorn cookies waiting for her inside. "Thank you so much, grandma!"`
	"CN-12577" `	"We should get going."`
	"CN-12578" `	Eeeya turns to you and says, "You're right, we should. Thank you so much for reuniting us." She gives Anoo one last hug, and boards your ship.`
	"CN-12579" `	"No pun intended, of course," Anoo laughs. Eeeya chuckles, and says, "Captain, I still need to sell my factory in the normal Hai space before officially joining Unfettered."`
	"CN-12580" `	"Sure thing. I'd be glad to take you back."`
	"CN-12581" `	"Why did you change your mind so quickly?"`
	"CN-12582" `	"Well, even without your input, I probably would have joined the Unfettered - as I said a while ago, my son's entire family died; Anoo's family is here. Anoo, I've got a surprise for you, still on the Captain's ship: 3 tons of acorn cookies! And <first>, would you take me back to <planet> so that I can sell off the factory?"`
	"CN-12583" `Eeeya immediately gets off the ship and goes to check on the acorn cookie shop. A few minutes later, she is back with documents for you to sign.`
	"CN-12584" `	"These will set you up with about a twentieth of the stock in my company; you'll receive the one hundred credits daily." As you sign the documents, she continues. "I'd just like to thank you again for helping me find Anoo. It means a lot to me." You check that the stocks have been transferred to your account, and Eeeya heads off.`
	"CN-12585" `Eeeya heads off to sell Acorn Delights' shop while you check in with spaceport security. Soon, she is back. "Well, there was a Hai who paid thirty million credits for that small place. I wonder why he thought it was worth so much - I sure don't. But I won't argue with that nutty person." She seems much merrier now that Anoo has been found. "I'll be ready to go when you are."`
	"CN-12586" `Eeeya leaves to go to the hospital, after paying you five hundred thousand credits and thanking you for the third time.`
	"CN-12587" `You are relaxing within the spaceport while your ship refuels after conducting a spot of business. On a video screen is some talk show that you haven't previously encountered, but which seems to be a quite popular one out of Tarazed.`
	"CN-12588" `	A young and fresh-faced man who looks incredibly ill at ease has just been brought out as a surprise guest by the host, Jonathon Camembert.`
	"CN-12589" `	"So now in our surprise segment, let me introduce you to Ronald Campbell. He once crewed on one of these big trade ships, but after seeing what he saw, he just had to come forward!"`
	"CN-12590" `	The host stresses the word "had" so much his voice squeaks, but it certainly grabs the audience's attention.`
	"CN-12591" `	"But first, let's take a look at a clip."`
	"CN-12592" `	They show a short video featuring alien ships, not Pug or Quarg, but something else. They are engaged in combat with each other, firing weapons quite unlike anything produced in human space.`
	"CN-12593" `	Actual footage of an unknown alien conflict would be unlikely, however.`
	"CN-12594" `	A clip of alien spaceships in combat with weapons quite unlike anything produced in human space is shown, and you recognize that the ships are Shield Beetles hammering away at each other with their Ion Cannons. This must be a video of the conflict between the Hai and Unfettered.`
	"CN-12595" `	When the clip ends, Campbell is encouraged by Camembert to talk about where he got the footage. Campbell is well presented, although his suit is obviously not his own - you couldn't imagine how a crewman would be able to afford an outfit like that on their salary - and he's clearly anxious. You can make out the beads of sweat on his brow as he considers his answer, and his neat suit is slightly crumpled in the way that happens when people wipe sweat off their palms a lot. When Campbell speaks, it is with a paranoid manner that is plain to see even through a screen. He talks at length about an ongoing conflict that threatens to spill over and drag all of humanity back to war; a war waged by an alien species known as the "Hai." Although he does not give their exact whereabouts, he says they can be reached, and in turn reach us, with just a hyperdrive.`
	"CN-12596" `	The idea that there's a directly accessible alien race, at war, that has also somehow been kept a secret, may just be a ridiculous rumor. Nevertheless, it is intriguing...`
	"CN-12597" `	The existence of the Hai is intended to be a secret to most humans. News like this being widespread could easily cause a crisis if many people believe it and find the Hai themselves...`
	"CN-12598" `You are relaxing at the spaceport while your ship refuels, when a breaking news broadcast comes on; it's not urgent enough to actually interrupt scheduled content, but urgent enough to fill the first ad break.`
	"CN-12599" `	The severe-looking anchorwoman bores down the camera with an expression that demands attention.`
	"CN-12600" `	"An ex-crewman employed by an itinerant trader has come forward to media about hostile aliens just beyond our borders. He claims to have brought video proof of an ongoing conflict that threatens to spill over and drag all of humanity back to war. Stay tuned for our full segment at six."`
	"CN-12601" `	Actual footage of an unknown alien conflict doesn't seem likely; that such news should come out so soon after the Pug smacks of a hoax. A quick glance at the clock shows you only have ten minutes to wait, so you stick around for the full segment out of curiosity.`
	"CN-12602" `	The news returns with the anchorwoman. It turns out that the crewman in question had been picked up by a minor media outlet on Tarazed. He had apparently traveled many weeks before deciding to seek the media in order to avoid being shut down by Republic Intelligence if he contacted them elsewhere. The man is fairly young, and appears very well presented, though he has a bit of the paranoid about him that is plain to see even through a screen.`
	"CN-12603" `	It is only after this that the anchorwoman reveals that, while this was initially treated as a hoax, one of their own reporters posed a timely question to a well-respected trader, resulting in quite the stir when he slipped up and confirmed the existence of the aliens known as "Hai."`
	"CN-12604" `As you go about your business, there is a buzz in the air that seems to be animating the Hai. Upon closer observation it seems that the same topic must be the talk of the hour, at least judging by the Hai phrases you keep hearing repeated, and both workers and visitors alike seem to be stopping to exchange comments at a far higher rate than you usually see.`
	"CN-12605" `	(Ask a Hai what's going on.)`
	"CN-12606" `	You catch a Hai, who doesn't appear to be in a rush, just as they finish one of these exchanges and ask them what's going on.`
	"CN-12607" `	"Oh, you have not seen? The Hai appear to be on human news. It has come through from a couple of the merchants who go between us and is causing much consternation."`
	"CN-12608" `	"How could this happen?"`
	"CN-12609" `	"Can you show me?"`
	"CN-12610" `	The Hai gives you a quizzical look. "Yes, human merchants come and go regularly, but the main defense of our secret is that humans simply do not care unless the news is sensational. This makes it very easy to ask your media organizations to simply not publicize any leaks they get. A crewman who will lose their job for leaking information will not do so unless it is valuable to them.`
	"CN-12611" `	"Now though, after the civil war and the Pug invasion, with your new government in the south, someone has taken advantage of the opportunity. Here, let me show you."`
	"CN-12612" `	The Hai pulls out a device and gestures for you to sit on a nearby bench.`
	"CN-12613" `	(Sit.)`
	"CN-12614" `	The Hai pulls up a video of some talk show that you haven't previously encountered, but which seems to be a quite popular one out of Tarazed. In it, a young and fresh-faced man is brought out as a surprise guest by the host, Jonathon Camembert.`
	"CN-12615" `	When the clip ends, Campbell is encouraged by Camembert to talk about where he got the footage. Campbell is well presented, although his suit is obviously not his own - you couldn't imagine how a crewman would be able to afford an outfit like that on their salary - and he's clearly anxious. You can make out the beads of sweat on his brow as he considers his answer, and his neat suit is slightly crumpled in the way that happens when people wipe sweat off their palms a lot. When Campbell speaks, it is with a paranoid manner that is plain to see even through a screen. He talks at length about an ongoing conflict that threatens to spill over and drag all of humanity back to war; a war waged by an alien species known as the "Hai." Although he does not give their exact whereabouts, he says they can be reached, and in turn reach humanity, with just a hyperdrive.`
	"CN-12616" `	The Hai pulls up a video of some the same talk show that you saw being aired in Free Worlds space with Jonathon Camembert's interview of Ronald Campbell.`
	"CN-12617" `	When it is done the Hai looks at you seriously. "We are told that this video has been seen by billions of people and reported on by other media outlets in human space. We are not sure what will happen now, but something certainly will."`
	"CN-12618" `	The Hai wishes you well and then leaves you to return to their business.`
	"CN-12619" `	You keep going about your business, but eventually turn a corner and come face-to-face with a life-sized holographic display of a human news anchor with the familiar background and logo of a human news organization. This is being projected up from a portable device set on a table that several Hai are gathered around. The severe-looking anchorwoman is rendered in clear detail as she bores down the camera with an expression that demands attention.`
	"CN-12620" `	"We return to our main story tonight. An ex-crewman employed by an itinerant trader has come forward to media about hostile aliens just beyond our borders. He claims to have brought video proof of an ongoing conflict that threatens to spill over and drag all of humanity back to war."`
	"CN-12621" `	As she continues it turns out that the crewman in question had been picked up by a minor media outlet on Tarazed. He had apparently traveled many weeks before deciding to seek the media in order to avoid being shut down by Republic Intelligence if he contacted them elsewhere. The man is fairly young, and appears very well presented, though he has a bit of the paranoid about him that is plain to see even through a screen.`
	"CN-12622" `	It is only after this that the anchorwoman reveals that, while this was initially treated as a hoax, one of their own reporters posed a timely question to a well-respected trader and caused quite the stir when he slipped up and confirmed the existence of the aliens known as "Hai."`
	"CN-12623" `	You keep going about your business, but eventually turn a corner and come face-to-face with a life-sized holographic display of a human news anchor with the familiar background and logo of a human news organization. This is being projected up from a portable device set on a table that several Hai are gathered around. You recognize it as the same news report you saw being aired outside of the Free Worlds, with the anchorwoman reporting on Campbell's appearance on the Tarazed talk show.`
	"CN-12624" `	Two of the Hai at the table seem to be seeing this for the first time. They make several loud comments that feel like they are some mixture of shock, excitement, and distress, though you only have their tone to go off.`
	"CN-12625" `	No wonder the place is abuzz; this is clearly a major event for the Hai.`
	"CN-12626" `	Your expression must be one of obvious bewilderment. Another human, a man, steps out of one of the stores nearby, looks at your expression, and immediately hails you.`
	"CN-12627" `	"Ah, Captain! Is this the first time you have landed since the news broke?"`
	"CN-12628" `	"What news?"`
	"CN-12629" `	"Clearly so."`
	"CN-12630" `	"The Hai have ended up on our news back home. Seems the war stirred things up, and someone wanted their fifteen minutes of fame.`
	"CN-12631" `	"Here, let me show you what they've got going around," he says as he pulls out a Hai data pad. He hits play on a video and a clip of alien spaceships in combat with weapons quite unlike anything produced in human space is shown, and you recognize that the ships are Shield Beetles hammering away at each other with their Ion Cannons. This must be a video of the conflict between the Hai and Unfettered.`
	"CN-12632" `	"Here, let me show you what they've got going around," he says as he pulls out a Hai data pad. He hits play on a video and shows you the same clip you saw circulating in human space.`
	"CN-12633" `	"Turns out," he says, "this was almost treated as a hoax, but some journo caught one of the regular traders off-guard and he let it slip. So now people know, or at least think they know, about the Hai."`
	"CN-12634" `	"What'll happen now?"`
	"CN-12635" `	The guy laughs. "It's not as if the Hai actually enforce their secrecy," he says, heavily emphasizing the word "enforce."`
	"CN-12636" `	"The merchants might fire a crewman for trying to leak information, but if the conditions are right to make more money by leaking it, someone was bound to eventually." He shrugs. "Guess the conditions were finally right for it."`
	"CN-12637" `	He looks around for a moment with an almost conspiratorial expression. "My money is on some kind of crisis. Keeping the secret is worth a lot of money to certain people. It's going to be an interesting few months, I think."`
	"CN-12638" `	He gives you a wink as he steps away. "Keep your eyes open, Captain. There may be new opportunities afoot."`
	"CN-12639" `After exiting your ship, you overhear an advisory warning being played on the spaceport's loudspeakers.`
	"CN-12640" `	"This is a report from the Republic Navy Advisory System. All civilian captains be aware of increased pirate activity in the uninhabited regions between the Far North and the Core. Captains are advised to stick to inhabited systems when traveling between the Far North and the Core." The message repeats every few minutes.`
	"CN-12641" `	You overhear two captains on the landing pad next to yours talking about the warning. "I know a few guys who aren't going to be very happy about that," one says.`
	"CN-12642" `	"You think they're running cover for that alien story that was on the news recently?" says the other. "Plenty of space up there to hide aliens."`
	"CN-12643" `	"Stop talking like a nut," says the first. "Advisory warnings like this happen all the time. Don't read too much into it."`
	"CN-12644" `While wandering the spaceport, you spot a familiar face that you didn't expect to find here: Alondo is being escorted around the spaceport by a small group of Hai. One of the Hai seems to be explaining something to him, while two others, dressed in what look like loose-fitting tuxedos and sunglasses, stand nearby surveying the crowd.`
	"CN-12645" `	(Walk up to him to see why he's here.)`
	"CN-12646" `	You keep your distance, and eventually Alondo and the Hai with him move on to another section of the spaceport, out of sight. It's curious that Alondo would be here. Perhaps it has something to do with the recent human news reports about the Hai.`
	"CN-12647" `	"Alondo!" you say as you approach.`
	"CN-12648" `	"Captain <last>!" Alondo responds, waving you over. Before you can get too close, one of the dressed Hai stands in your way.`
	"CN-12649" `You land on <origin> and survey the people roaming the spaceport while you refill your ship.`
	"CN-12650" `	It seems that news of the Hai's existence being somewhat exposed on human news networks has reached the Hai, as you can overhear discussions about the news reports and what might happen next.`
	"CN-12651" `	The Hai still seem energetic and chatty about the news of the Hai's existence being somewhat exposed to humanity.`
	"CN-12652" `	Luckily, it appears that nothing bad has come of it, at least not yet. Even if a lot of humans who saw the news believed it, it's likely that the Hai's location is still remote enough to prevent most captains from stumbling upon it. It's also likely to be only a matter of time before the lid gets entirely blown off of the situation.`
	"CN-12653" `	As you finish refueling your ship, you hear a familiar voice call to you. "Captain <last>! Funny seeing you here." You turn around to find Alondo approaching you, flanked by two Hai dressed in what look like loose-fitting tuxedos and sunglasses. Before Alondo can reach you, one of the Hai swiftly steps forward and stands directly in front of you.`
	"CN-12654" `	"Please state your name and business," the Hai commands. This might be a bit more menacing of a situation if Hai weren't so short relative to most humans.`
	"CN-12655" `	"Don't worry, Mep. This is Captain <first> <last>, who I spoke of earlier," Alondo vouches for you. "We fought in the war together."`
	"CN-12656" `	The Hai seems to ponder Alondo's words for a moment, then steps aside while still keeping a close eye on you.`
	"CN-12657" `	"What brings you here?"`
	"CN-12658" `	"What's up with him?"`
	"CN-12659" `	"The Hai government is very... on edge, at the moment," Alondo says. "They're typically quite open, from what I understand, but these recent news reports have many Hai officials feeling as though they've been betrayed. They're being highly cautious as a result."`
	"CN-12660" `	"So what brings you here?" you ask.`
	"CN-12661" `	"I'm sure you've heard the news circulating around humanity," Alondo responds.`
	"CN-12662" `	"I'm here on request of the Republic to act as an envoy between the Free Worlds and the Hai government. Although now that I say that out loud, I'm starting to realize just how absurd of a situation this is. I certainly didn't have 'Become engaged in an alien civil crisis' on my bingo card for this year. Although I also didn't have 'Fight off an alien invasion' on my bingo card for the war, so maybe I should just start expecting the unexpected from now on.`
	"CN-12663" `	"Anyway, the Hai have been giving me a tour of their systems since I got here within the past month. I'll be meeting with others from the Republic and Syndicate on <planet> for a briefing after I've done my tour here. You should probably come with us, because Lord knows we'll need all the help we can get to prevent this situation from turning hot. We wouldn't want a misunderstanding between humanity and the Hai to turn into a conflict."`
	"CN-12664" `	"Anyway, I've been here for some time now doing what I can to help keep this situation from blowing up. I'll be meeting with others from the Republic and Syndicate on <planet> soon for a briefing. You should probably join us, because Lord knows we'll need all the help we can get to prevent this situation from turning hot. We wouldn't want a misunderstanding between humanity and the Hai to turn into a conflict."`
	"CN-12665" `	"I'd be glad to come."`
	"CN-12666" `	"Sorry, but I have other things to get to at the moment."`
	"CN-12667" `	"That's good to hear," Alondo says. "In a situation like this, the Hai need humans they can trust. They seem to trust me enough so far, so hopefully they'll also trust you by proxy, or, at the very least, you can gain their trust in short order.`
	"CN-12668" `	"Meet my ship, the <npc>, in orbit after I'm finished with my business here." You assure Alondo that you'll be there, and the Hai escort him away.`
	"CN-12669" `	"I'll probably reach out to you for help later, then. In a situation like this, the Hai need humans they can trust. They seem to trust me enough so far, so hopefully they'll also trust you by proxy, or, at the very least, you can gain their trust in short order.`
	"CN-12670" `	"Well, good luck with whatever it is that you're busy with," he says. You say your goodbyes to Alondo, and the Hai escort him away.`
	"CN-12671" `You receive a message from Alondo. "Captain <last>. I hope you've finished your work, as I could use your assistance in dealing with this situation. Please join us on <destination> when you're able. We're holding a briefing on the latest updates."`
	"CN-12672" `You follow Alondo's ship to the surface of <origin>. Instead of landing at the main spaceport, his ship veers off to a separate area of the city where a cluster of several large structures are set slightly apart from the rest. A Hai warship shadows you as you approach.`
	"CN-12673" `	Alondo's ship touches down in a smaller port atop one of the high-rises here, and you follow suit. As you touch your ship down next to Alondo's, the Hai warship following you moves to idle above the spaceport.`
	"CN-12674" `	"Welcome to the secure port," Alondo greets you as you exit your ship. "Our home away from home."`
	"CN-12675" `As you enter the atmosphere of <origin>, the spaceport authorities contact you and give you coordinates to a landing area that is separate from the main spaceport. A Hai warship shadows you as you approach.`
	"CN-12676" `	You find that the coordinates lead to a smaller port atop one of the city's high-rises, and you spot a Hai Centipede already landed there, with Alondo standing just outside of it. As you touch your ship down next to Alondo, the Hai warship following you moves to idle above the spaceport.`
	"CN-12677" `	"Glad you could make it," Alondo greets you as you exit your ship. "Welcome to the secure port. Our home away from home."`
	"CN-12678" `	"What's with the warship?"`
	"CN-12679" `	"What's so secure about it?"`
	"CN-12680" `	"Looks like a nice place. Let's get to that briefing you mentioned."`
	"CN-12681" `	"Well it's closed to the public, and as you can see," Alondo says while pointing up at the warship above you, "the Hai are guarding it well. There's no 'human embassy' or 'consulate' for us to make use of, so the Hai decided to put one of their old court buildings to use, allowing us to use it as our base of operations while we're navigating this crisis."`
	"CN-12682" `	"This entire building used to be a courthouse?"`
	"CN-12683" `	"It doesn't feel like much of a crisis to me."`
	"CN-12684" `	"Why the heavy guard? Are they expecting violence?"`
	"CN-12685" `	"It was; apparently large reinforced rooms are easy to convert into landing spaces. From the little I've seen, the Hai have a rather, shall we say, labyrinthine system of government. This building was only a small part of that. Whatever the case, we have a briefing to get to," Alondo says while motioning to the door inside.`
	"CN-12686" `	"Well... I could explain more, but that's what this briefing is for," Alondo says while motioning to the door inside.`
	"CN-12687" `	"As I mentioned earlier, their government is on edge at the moment. I'm sure they aren't expecting us to be violent, but they also want to be prepared for anything. Whatever the case, we have a briefing to get to," Alondo says while motioning to the door inside.`
	"CN-12688" `	Alondo leads you to a meeting room that feels large for the number of people present: it looks like a lecture hall that could easily fit a hundred people, but there are only six here. Aside from Alondo and yourself, there is a shorter man in what you recognize as a Republic diplomatic uniform messing with a holoprojector that doesn't appear to be working, a taller man in a suit sitting next to a woman in a formal dress in the front row, and an older looking Hai woman sitting alone at the end of a row of seats.`
	"CN-12689" `	"Glad you finally decided to show up, Alondo," says the man in the front.`
	"CN-12690" `	"And you brought a guest," says the Hai.`
	"CN-12691" `	"I did," Alondo responds. "This is Captain <first> <last>. Member of the Free Worlds Council during the war. Helped repel the Pug invasion. A capable pilot. Am I missing anything?"`
	"CN-12692" `	"That sounds like everything."`
	"CN-12693" `	"Just that I'm good looking."`
	"CN-12694" `	"There we go!" says the man who was fiddling with the holoprojector as it whirs to life. "No time for introductions. We're late enough as is. Everyone, please sit down."`
	"CN-12695" `	The holoprojector displays a series of graphs. You're no expert in data analysis, but a highlighted "chance of total crisis" at the bottom ranging from 61% to 96% does not look promising.`
	"CN-12696" `	"Please turn your attention to this chart here," he says while pointing to a bar graph. "We've continued to track the number of new arrivals to Hai territory. As noted on the left, the number of new monthly arrivals was in the low hundreds prior to the leaks being broadcast. Within only a short time after, that number quickly rose to the thousands. Mitigation efforts by the Navy to dissuade civilian captains from discovering the wormhole in Ultima Thule by circulating reports of increased pirate activity have since suppressed this number somewhat, but the rate of new arrivals is still well above what it once was.`
	"CN-12697" `	"It has been noted that the character of these new arrivals is also different. Where once a majority of new arrivals were lone explorers or lost captains, they are now increasingly captains following breadcrumbs while looking for the Hai or bringing large groups of 'tourists' with the promise of witnessing the aliens from the news reports. Further research will need to be done to determine the threat that these new arrivals pose in continuing to escalate the situation."`
	"CN-12698" `	"What's the problem with new arrivals?"`
	"CN-12699" `	"Do we not have a way of blocking captains from entering the wormhole?"`
	"CN-12700" `	"We do not have the means of handling a large influx of humans," says the Hai. "For decades, we have dealt with a small trickle of humans arriving through the wormhole. We have grown accustomed to it. But if that trickle were to suddenly become a downpour, then our services would quickly become overrun."`
	"CN-12701" `	The man presenting the graphs nods in agreement. "Of importance is also the effect that this situation may have for the Republic," he says while pointing at another graph labeled "artifact penetration" which shows a map of various stages of events and their outcomes.`
	"CN-12702" `	"We could get the Navy to blockade the wormhole," says Alondo, "but such an overt action would be no different than outright stating to everyone that Campbell was telling the truth, which could easily lead to civil unrest after the events of the Pug invasion."`
	"CN-12703" `	The man presenting the graphs nods in agreement. "Precisely my next topic," he says while pointing at another graph labeled "artifact penetration" which shows a map of various stages of events and their outcomes.`
	"CN-12704" `	"Artifact penetration is the point at which a government cannot reasonably attempt to pretend something is anything but the truth, at least not while still holding to the claim of being a representative government. Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic may be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months, or we would lose so much credibility as to compromise electoral stability. The actual time limit is probably sooner."`
	"CN-12705" `	"What are the plans to prevent that?"`
	"CN-12706" `	"Would that be so bad?"`
	"CN-12707" `	"It is always bad to be forced into acknowledging a secret. If we act sooner, we may control the manner of that secret's release," he says. "Plus, while the Hai have let the trickle of humans that find the wormhole settle here peacefully, a massive influx is a problem nobody really wants to have to deal with.`
	"CN-12708" `	"We are currently still gathering information and weighing various potential options. Complete containment of this situation may already be impossible, and so plans which aim for that may not be worth following. If so, we would instead follow the plans which seek to formally reveal the existence of the Hai to humanity in as controlled a manner as possible. Only time will tell if that is the case, though."`
	"CN-12709" `	After the briefing is finished, the Hai woman approaches you. "Greetings, Captain <last>. I am grateful that you will be helping us. My name is Sayari. I was the envoy to the human government a century ago." The present situation is all the evidence needed to make it clear that the Republic has never mentioned the Hai, nor publicly acknowledged receiving an envoy from them.`
	"CN-12710" `	Before you can get into a conversation with Sayari, the presenter butts in. "Yes, yes, and I have a task for you to be helpful with now. Please meet me outside at the port," he says before swiftly leaving the room.`
	"CN-12711" `	Sayari chuckles. "So much on that human's mind. I have not seen him take a break since he has arrived. It is as if he is more stressed about this situation than any Hai."`
	"CN-12712" `Sayari follows you out to the landing pads to meet the presenter. "Captain <last>," he says while grasping your hand in a firm handshake. "Xilin Yang, Republic Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. I apologize for not introducing myself sooner. It's an honor to meet a hero of the Pug crisis such as yourself."`
	"CN-12713" `	"It was hard-fought, but it was necessary."`
	"CN-12714" `	"Thanks, but it wasn't as dramatic as they made it out to be. I'm just happy to have helped where I could."`
	"CN-12715" `	"You're every inch what I expected," he assures you.`
	"CN-12716" `	For a moment his expression falters, and then he seems almost relieved. "You may be a better person than I expected to meet.`
	"CN-12717" `	"Now, about that task. I mentioned during our briefing that we need to determine how much of a threat these new arrivals might be. Not a threat in the sense that they will become violent, but in the sense that they could exacerbate the situation, such as by returning to our space and making a big stink about what they've found here. The best place to go for this would be <destination>."`
	"CN-12718" `	"I would like to follow and observe," says Sayari.`
	"CN-12719" `	"You're free to come," says Xilin. "Let me pack a few items into your ship, Captain <last>, and we can be on our way."`
	"CN-12720" `The rate at which new ships show up isn't tremendous, so Xilin starts by speaking with some of the older captains who have been here prior to the news. "You can learn a lot by sharing a drink with the right merchant," he says to you.`
	"CN-12721" `	One captain in particular has been camped out here to intercept new captains as they arrive and give them the induction tour. He also has a copious set of notes that he gladly shares with Xilin. "After I heard the news, I figured I'd help by keeping notes on new arrivals. They make themselves very obvious with the way they gawk," he says. "We had two new ships come in yesterday, a Freighter and an Osprey, but there's been nothing today as of yet. It's normally only one or two smaller ships a day, if that."`
	"CN-12722" `	Xilin decides to next search the spaceport for captains that showed up recently, but just before heading off, a Star Queen full of passengers lands in the spaceport with everyone on board pressing their faces against the windows.`
	"CN-12723" `	"You have to be kidding me," Xilin says under his breath while approaching the ship.`
	"CN-12724" `	"Welcome, one and all, to the land of the Hai," the ship's captain says while walking down the boarding ramp with all her passengers behind her.`
	"CN-12725" `	"Excuse me, Captain. Do you care to answer a few questions?" Xilin shouts up to the captain. She looks concerned to see Xilin standing there in a Republic uniform, but agrees to talk after shooing her passengers off into the spaceport.`
	"CN-12726" `	"What is it you need to know, officer?" the captain asks.`
	"CN-12727" `	Although Xilin isn't a Navy officer, he doesn't correct her. "I'd like to know why it is that you decided to bring all these passengers who had never been to Hai space before."`
	"CN-12728" `	The captain scratches the back of her head. "Well after seeing the news back home, I figured the secret was already out. Might as well make the most of it, you know?"`
	"CN-12729" `	(Let Xilin handle this.)`
	"CN-12730" `	"Didn't you hear the Navy's advisory? You could have gotten your passengers killed coming here."`
	"CN-12731" `	The captain scoffs. "Well yeah, but I figured it was just a cover-up from the Navy to stop people."`
	"CN-12732" `	"Would that not imply that the secret isn't truly 'out' then?" Sayari asks while giving the captain a stern look.`
	"CN-12733" `	"No, I don't know," says Xilin while giving the captain a stern look. "Rumors of the Hai becoming mainstream don't constitute the secret being 'out' to me."`
	"CN-12734" `	"Well, when you put it that way..." the captain says nervously. "Okay, just spit it out already. Am I in trouble?"`
	"CN-12735" `	"No," Xilin says while looking away. "But they might be."`
	"CN-12736" `	You follow Xilin's gaze to see a beat-up Berserker that looks like it can barely fly landing in the spaceport. "You're free to go," Xilin says to the Star Queen captain.`
	"CN-12737" `	You approach the Berserker as it finishes landing. The captain of the ship exits looking far calmer than the condition of the Berserker would suggest he should be. "Uh, hi," he says awkwardly. "Can I help you guys?"`
	"CN-12738" `	"What happened to your ship?"`
	"CN-12739" `	"Did you get attacked by pirates on the way here?"`
	"CN-12740" `	The captain looks back at the poor state of his interceptor. "Oh, that. Yeah, I ran into a couple pirates on the way here. Nothing I haven't dealt with before, though."`
	"CN-12741" `	"So you've been to Hai space before?" Xilin asks.`
	"CN-12742" `	"Sure. Plenty of times," he responds.`
	"CN-12743" `	Xilin looks over the interceptor with a quizzical expression. "May I see your pilot's license?"`
	"CN-12744" `	"Yeah, no problem," the captain says, as he quickly pulls a license out of his pocket that looks almost as beat up as the interceptor. Xilin jots down the details and hands the license back to the captain. "Thank you. And maybe tag along with a merchant fleet on your way back home."`
	"CN-12745" `	"That sounds like a good idea," the captain says before walking off into the spaceport.`
	"CN-12746" `	You continue to question more captains in the spaceport over the course of the day with Xilin and Sayari. Most turn out to be repeat visitors or those who have taken to conducting their business entirely in Hai space, but they are all familiar with arrivals who heard of the way to the Hai through whispers in spaceport bars or were sold coordinates by knowledgeable captains, and many are able to provide information about these encounters. It seems that everyone has been peaceful enough in interacting with the Hai so far, but clearly the word is getting out more as time goes on.`
	"CN-12747" `You return to the briefing room at the secure port with Xilin and Sayari, and Xilin begins transferring his notes into a terminal. He then pauses while staring at something on the screen.`
	"CN-12748" `	"I'm running each of the pilot's licenses and ship registrations through my copy of the Republic's pilot database. They've all come up as valid and with mostly clean records. All except for one." He turns the terminal screen toward you and Sayari, displaying an inputted license ID that the system says does not exist.`
	"CN-12749" `	"This is from that Berserker pilot. What's more is that if I run the ID of the ship, it's registered as stolen."`
	"CN-12750" `	Sayari gives a look of concern. "Are you suggesting that this captain was a criminal?"`
	"CN-12751" `	"Highly likely," Xilin responds. "A pirate with a stolen ship and a counterfeit license."`
	"CN-12752" `	"I will inform our spaceport authorities to look out for this captain and his ship," Sayari says. "It may also be beneficial if you were to make this database available to us, so that we may monitor other potential criminal humans."`
	"CN-12753" `	"Unfortunately, I'd have to gain authorization for that," says Xilin. "But I'll see what I can do."`
	"CN-12754" `	"Should I help track down that captain?"`
	"CN-12755" `	"So are pirates trying to sneak their way into Hai territory?"`
	"CN-12756" `	"That may be the case," Xilin says. "We'd be stupid to suspect this as only having been an isolated incident."`
	"CN-12757" `	"No, leave that to the Hai," Xilin says. "At least for so long as this is our only lead on pirate activity in Hai territory, although I imagine that we'll find more if we go looking for it."`
	"CN-12758" `	"We have had run-ins with your pirates before," Sayari says. "Most of the time they cause only mischief. Very rarely do they raid our fleets or cause any large trouble. I fear though that this situation will only embolden them."`
	"CN-12759" `	Just then, Alondo pokes his head into the room looking somewhat exasperated. "Captain <last>. Could you give Remington a hand? He's out on the landing pads." He disappears again without waiting for a reply, and you hear his heavy footsteps grow quieter as he walks away.`
	"CN-12760" `	"You go help Remington," Xilin says. "I'll continue my work here."`
	"CN-12761" `You exit the building onto the landing pads with Sayari following behind you and find the tall man and the woman from the front row of the briefing waiting by your ship.`
	"CN-12762" `	"Captain <last>, is it? I don't believe we've met before," he says while shaking your hand, perhaps a little too firmly. "I'm Samuel Remington, head of the Syndicate's PR department. You may not have heard of me before, but I'm sure you've heard of my work. I..." He stops himself. "You know what, never mind. We're not here to make small talk. We have bigger things to worry about. I'm looking forward to working alongside you to handle this emerging crisis."`
	"CN-12763" `	"Captain <last>, is it? It's been a good while since we last met," he says while shaking your hand, perhaps a little too firmly. "We met back on Hephaestus near the start of the war. It's been a while, so I'll forgive you if you've forgotten me. I'm looking forward to working alongside you to handle this emerging crisis."`
	"CN-12764" `	You note that his appearance is rather casual compared to what you would expect from someone of importance in the Syndicate, wearing khakis and a collared tee as opposed to the typical suit and tie business attire that you see on Syndicate businessmen. It is certainly in contrast to the young woman standing behind him, who is wearing the usual business attire.`
	"CN-12765" `	"Now, allow me to introduce you to Terry," Remington says while gesturing to the woman behind him.`
	"CN-12766" `	"Terry Adrianopoulos. Pleasure to meet you," she says with a broad smile and a slight bow. The young woman goes from calculating to gregarious in the blink of an eye as your attention shifts to her. She seems at once pleasant and approachable while at the same time being slightly off-putting and uncanny. It's an eerie feeling.`
	"CN-12767" `	"Terry is... well, let's call her my secretary," Remington says with a sly smile. Terry seems none too pleased to hear that, but she doesn't correct him.`
	"CN-12768" `	"Alondo said you needed my help with something."`
	"CN-12769" `	"The Syndicate sent their PR team to deal with this?"`
	"CN-12770" `	"I'll have you know I'm considered something of a miracle worker among the Syndicate," Remington says in a wry tone. "The Syndicate was sad to rent me out, but there's also an internal political situation going on that has been causing me quite the headache recently." His eyes momentarily flick to Terry as he says that, but Remington presses on immediately. "It's nothing I can discuss in detail, with all the NDAs involved, you know, but something I'll certainly enjoy taking a break from."`
	"CN-12771" `	"Alondo said you needed my help," you say.`
	"CN-12772" `	"Ah, yes. Well you see, I'd like to travel to <destination> to get the lay of the land around the conflict between the two Hai groups. Care to give me a ride there? It'd be just the two of us."`
	"CN-12773" `	"I will be accompanying you," Sayari says.`
	"CN-12774" `	"Just the three of us, then," Remington adds. "The Wah Ki system is where Mr. Campbell's video that's been plastered all over the news was taken. I imagine any new arrivals attempting to look into the validity of the video themselves would find their way there, so it'd be worth checking in on the place."`
	"CN-12775" `It doesn't take long to prove Remington's hunch correct. You find a group of new arrivals gathered by a group of Hai captains and crewmen, asking them question after question. "Why are you guys hiding up here?" "Where can I buy some of those weapons of yours?" "Do you eat acorns?" Some of the Hai look intrigued by the attention they're being given, but others look annoyed.`
	"CN-12776" `	One of the human captains seems to be riling the others up and being rather hostile with his comments. "Do you really think you could invade us? You're like half my size; I could take you on in a fight any day."`
	"CN-12777" `	Remington shakes his head. "I'm going to step in before this turns ugly," he says while pulling a small device out of his pocket. It's not anything that you recognize, but it has a Hai appearance to it.`
	"CN-12778" `	He shouts to gain everyone's attention before tossing the device between the two groups. As it lands, a life-sized image of a Pug appears, looking almost realistic aside from the fact that its facing angle seems to follow your perspective. Most of the human captains jump back.`
	"CN-12779" `	"Can anyone tell me what that is?" Remington asks.`
	"CN-12780" `	"That's one of those Pug things!" says one of the human captains.`
	"CN-12781" `	"Correct. And I take it you don't like them."`
	"CN-12782" `	"Why would I like something that invaded my home planet?" says another captain.`
	"CN-12783" `	"Exactly. So why are you doing that to these Hai here? What's the issue you take with them, anyway?"`
	"CN-12784" `	"Well, I'm just..." the captain begins to trip through a response before being cut off.`
	"CN-12785" `	"Captain <last>," Remington says while turning to you. "Can you tell me what the difference between the Hai and the Pug is?"`
	"CN-12786" `	"The Hai aren't invading us."`
	"CN-12787" `	"The Hai are cuter."`
	"CN-12788" `	"The Hai are friendly."`
	"CN-12789" `	"But they could!" one of the captains pipes up.`
	"CN-12790" `	"Really?" Remington responds. "So because these Hai here are fighting pirates of their own species, you think they could invade us? Could the Syndicate's security forces invade the Republic because they fight off pirates, or the Republic decide to invade the Free Worlds because they fight off pirates? Maybe the answer is yes, but there's a big difference between could and will.`
	"CN-12791" `	"I've seen cute dogs turn fearsome before!" one of the captains pipes up.`
	"CN-12792" `	Remington gives the captain (and you) a slight look of disbelief, but he rolls with it. "Okay, so maybe cute things can be fearsome, but has a fearsome dog ever invaded your home planet?`
	"CN-12793" `	"But they might not always be!" one of the captains pipes up.`
	"CN-12794" `	"Perhaps not," Remington responds, "but is that any justification for you being hostile now? People had the same fear of the Quarg centuries ago when they were first discovered, but have the Quarg been anything but friendly in that time?`
	"CN-12795" `	"My point is that if these Hai were really interested in invading us, do you think we'd all be here right now? The Hai are not hostile to us, so why would we give them a reason to be by sitting here and bugging their warship captains?" Remington says to the crowd.`
	"CN-12796" `	You look over to the group of Hai to see Sayari speaking to them in their own language, likely trying to prevent the Hai from doing anything brash.`
	"CN-12797" `	Remington speaks with the crowd of humans for a little while longer, eventually convincing them to leave the Hai alone. "Let's head back to <planet>," Remington says. "I've seen enough here. And we should probably think about having the spaceport authority here restrict who can land, at least until all this blows over."`
	"CN-12798" `	"Perhaps," Sayari responds.`
	"CN-12799" `You return to the briefing room at the secure port with Remington and Sayari. "This Hai holographic tech is pretty nifty, isn't it?" Remington says while playing around with the device he used on <origin>. "Way more advanced than anything we've got back home. It's also pretty useful that there's a port for one of our cables, otherwise I never would have figured out how to get that Pug image on there."`
	"CN-12800" `	"Ah, yes," Sayari says. "Many decades of interaction with humans has led us to accommodate much of our technology to your needs. Humans are our guests here, so we saw it only right to make you feel more comfortable. A shame to see a few bad apples may spoil the bunch."`
	"CN-12801" `	"You have apples up here?" Remington asks.`
	"CN-12802" `	Sayari chuckles. "Just as we have adapted our technology to human needs, we have also imported many human foods and learned human sayings. It has all been very exciting."`
	"CN-12803" `	Sayari pauses for a moment. "Our civilization is tens of thousands of years old. There is little in that time that we have not done on our own. But seeing such a young species has led to much excitement. I wish for that excitement to not turn into strife. This is what I explained to the Hai on <origin>. 'These humans are young. Be patient with them.'"`
	"CN-12804" `	"Glad to see that you still have a positive view of us."`
	"CN-12805" `	"Well, we're here to do our best to make that wish come true."`
	"CN-12806" `	Sayari goes on about the history between Hai and humanity, how a colony exploration team sanctioned by the Republic found the wormhole in Ultima Thule and made first contact between the Hai and the Republic. Early on, they used the Quarg as translators between the two parties, but eventually the Hai began to learn the human language. Some humans also began to learn Hai, but it seems much more difficult for a human to speak Hai than the other way around.`
	"CN-12807" `	While Sayari is telling stories, Terry walks in and motions to you. "<last>. I need someone with a ship and enough skill to not get blown up. Meet me by the landing pads when you're ready."`
	"CN-12808" `When you exit onto the landing pads, you find that Terry has just finished ensuring your ship is refueled. "Alright, Captain. I have a simple mission for you. We need someone to scout out the ship frequencies in various uninhabited systems in the Far North. We know how many merchants are arriving here, but we're not sure how many are attempting and failing, for one reason or another. I need you to fly through these systems and report back here with what you find."`
	"CN-12809" `	She takes a deep breath before saying: "<waypoints>. Think you can remember all those? Good." She doesn't even wait for a response. "Stick around in each system if you can, as I want to know just how many merchants, pirates, and Navy ships are passing through that region."`
	"CN-12810" `	She tosses you a data pad containing coordinates to all the systems she mentioned and starts walking back inside. "Just come back here once you're finished."`
	"CN-12811" `Terry quickly takes a copy of your ship's system logs upon your return. "Thank you, Captain. I'll have these analyzed in no time." Terry runs back into the building just as Sayari comes out carrying a small box.`
	"CN-12812" `	"Captain <last>. I know we are asking much of you, but I have a task of my own." She hands you the box, which displays official Hai government branding. Inside is an encrypted data chip and a metallic badge, with a symbol minutely engraved into the front that must be the Hai government's emblem. Surrounding it in a circle is some sort of pattern, which reminds you of the codes found on identification cards and licenses in human space. On the other side, there is extensive writing in a script that looks to be Hai. From this, you presume that the badge is some sort of diplomatic ID.`
	"CN-12813" `	"Please deliver this message to the Republic. I trust that they will disseminate it to your other governments. This badge should make it easier if they give you trouble."`
	"CN-12814" `	"Consider it done."`
	"CN-12815" `On approach to the spaceport on Earth, you request to speak to a diplomatic official. Given your renown from the Pug war, they promise you a "speedy two to three business days" wait. But after showing the diplomatic ID that Sayari gave you, that quickly shrinks to "two hours."`
	"CN-12816" `	You meet with Jamal Rahman, the Chief Minister of Foreign Affairs and Xilin's boss. "I take it you've involved yourself with this 'Hai' situation," he says. You nod. "Well I apologize, but I do not have much time for small talk. What is it you need me for?" You hand him the encrypted message that Sayari gave you and explain where it's from. He thanks you, and leaves with the message.`
	"CN-12817" `	Some hours later, Rahman returns with an encrypted data chip. "This is our response. Safe travels, Captain."`
	"CN-12818" `You meet Sayari at the secure port and hand her the response from the Republic. "Thank you, Captain <last>," she says. "Not only for this task, but for the other tasks you have completed for us. You've helped with many tasks which might otherwise have been sources of tension without you."`
	"CN-12819" `	"Don't mention it. I don't do it for the praise."`
	"CN-12820" `	"Is there anything else you need me for?"`
	"CN-12821" `	Sayari smiles. "How humble. Although I suppose you're wondering what do to next.`
	"CN-12822" `	"For now, there are no immediate tasks for you. The others will continue working on the plan to manage the situation, and we will call upon you once you are needed. I suggest you explore our systems while you wait and gain a better understanding of the Hai people. It will do us well for you to have this knowledge."`
	"CN-12823" `News report that says that the guy who showed the video of the Hai ships five months prior was just a viral marketing stunt for an upcoming movie.`
	"CN-12824" `You are directed to an official landing pad on your return to Hai-home, and it is not long before you are introducing your entourage to Sayari. Alondo in particular seems excited to be here and seems to have a knack for charming Sayari with polite and insightful, if rather simple, questions throughout the diplomatic niceties.`
	"CN-12825" `	A functionary leads you to what appears to be a situation room, filled with monitors, holoprojectors, and other equipment. Everyone takes their seats at a semicircle-shaped table, and the functionary motions you to the middle seat. A massive holoprojector in front of the table turns on.`
	"CN-12826" `	"I don't recall there being nearly so many pirates before."`
	"CN-12827" `	Sayari frowns and exhales a long breath through her nose, "Yes. Well, it seems that the rumors making their way through your media have attracted every opportunist this side of the Deep."`
	"CN-12828" `	"Of course," she says, "some of the pirates were aware of us, and we were aware of them being aware of us. We had a quiet arrangement with a select few where we rewarded them for keeping the secret well contained within their own circles."`
	"CN-12829" `	Alondo looks surprised, and seems sufficiently taken aback to spare a questioning glance at Remington despite the deliberate lack of interaction between them so far. Remington's expression is unreadable though, and Mr. Yang and Ms. Adrianopolous both merely nod.`
	"CN-12830" `	Sayari does not appear to notice the exchange. "Extra security forces are being called in, but we've been busier than usual in Wah Ki with our northern brethren."`
	"CN-12831" `	"Are the other Hai likely to be a problem here?"`
	"CN-12832" `	"How much longer can the Republic keep up the ruse?"`
	"CN-12833" `	Sayari shakes her head. "No problem remotely so severe as the one at hand. Now, I expect you have something for us, Mr. Yang?"`
	"CN-12834" `	"Well, I'm afraid I may have some bad news from our side." He taps on his screen as he says, 'bad news,' and the holoprojector begins showing a series of charts.`
	"CN-12835" `	Mr. Yang responds, "On that, I'm afraid I may have some bad news." He taps on his screen as he says, 'bad news,' and the holoprojector begins showing a series of charts.`
	"CN-12836" `	"One of the things I brought with me was Republic Intelligence's estimate of the effectiveness of various information containment measures."`
	"CN-12837" `	You're not an expert at data analysis, but the highlighted percentages ranging from 4% to 39% do not look promising. The final graphic is a map of stages of what is labeled as "artifact penetration." "Artifact penetration is the point at which a government cannot reasonably attempt to pretend something is anything but the truth, at least not while still holding to the claim of being a representative government," explains Mr. Yang.`
	"CN-12838" `	He checks the date. "Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic will be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months, or we would lose so much credibility as to compromise electoral stability. The actual time limit is probably sooner."`
	"CN-12839" `	"It is always bad to be forced into acknowledging a secret. If we act sooner, we may control the manner of that secret's release," says Xilin. "Plus, while the Hai have let the trickle of humans that find the wormhole settle here peacefully, a massive influx is a problem nobody really wants to have to deal with."`
	"CN-12840" `	Sayari looks at you. "We will have to come up with a plan, and quickly, but for the moment may I ask a favor of the war hero in the room? Please meet up with the security forces converging on Allhome and help them rout the pirates back to the other side of the wormhole. It will buy us some breathing room and options."`
	"CN-12841" `	It is so hard to say "no" to a Hai and their cute squirrelly features.`
	"CN-12842" `	"I'll do what I can."`
	"CN-12843" `When you land on Allhome, you are greeted by the quartermaster of the local Hai security forces. You're not an expert at judging Hai ages, but he appears to be a little younger than expected.`
	"CN-12844" `	"Captain <last>! I heard you were coming to assist."`
	"CN-12845" `	"Time to rout some pirates, baby!"`
	"CN-12846" `	"I'm here to reinforce you. What can I do?"`
	"CN-12847" `	"Uh well, yes. I presume you saw the pirates on your way in? They've been appearing en masse and overwhelming security forces to raid technology and goods from the Hai traders and their security. Some of them have even been sneaking down onto the planet, capturing Hai, and taking them away."`
	"CN-12848" `	"I have heard about the kidnapping."`
	"CN-12849" `	He nods. "Unfortunately, it's taking a while for them to redistribute an appropriately resourced defense force, thanks to the Unfettered. It's bad enough that we've had to bring the old Ladybug models out of mothballs to bolster our forces here."`
	"CN-12850" `	"Even more unfortunately," he continues, "it seems that the overabundance of these pirates is the result of one particular individual's success. His ship, called the Black Lich, is in Waypoint with a stolen Geocoris that has been converted into some kind of semi-stable weapons platform and is now being used as a temporary base."`
	"CN-12851" `	"This does give us an opportunity, however. If the kidnapped Hai are still on board, we might be able to rescue them, and if we can defeat the Black Lich, we may stem the tide of opportunists that are swarming through the wormhole.`
	"CN-12852" `	"We have ships we can send in support, but they dare not go it alone. What do you say?"`
	"CN-12853" `	The poor quartermaster seems desperate.`
	"CN-12854" `	"I'll make sure the Lich is properly dealt with."`
	"CN-12855" `	"We'll give those pirates a lesson they won't soon forget."`
	"CN-12856" `	"I'll beat the Lich, and do my best to capture the Geocoris and bring them safely home."`
	"CN-12857" `Shortly after you return, the Hai quartermaster thanks you profusely. "The Allhome government has authorized a reward of <payment> for helping to route the pirate problem," he explains while handing you the credits.`
	"CN-12858" `	He sighs deeply. "It is a shame though that the kidnapped Hai could not be saved, but the other Hai captains tell me it was a mess out there."`
	"CN-12859" `	In an oddly human gesture that feels very deliberate, he places one of his furry hands comfortingly on your shoulder, "I'm sure you did all you could."`
	"CN-12860" `You have defeated the Black Lich and also successfully reclaimed the Geocoris and, in doing so, rescued the kidnapped Hai! On your way back to <planet> the crew you sent across to fly it home reported that something is different about it... It appears that it has been modified with systems of some kind, which are not of Hai design. It also appears that perhaps not everything about those systems is working wholly as intended.`
	"CN-12861" `	As you disembark you spot the Hai quartermaster checking on the Hai disembarking from the Geocoris, and after a short while he approaches you. "Captain <last>, I cannot thank you enough for your rescue of our kidnapped people. You're a hero to them. The Allhome government has also authorized a reward of <payment> for helping to relieve the pirate problem," he explains while handing you the credits.`
	"CN-12862" `	"Lucky for you, the merchant who owned the Geocoris has already filed the insurance claim, so you get to keep the ship as a trophy.`
	"CN-12863" `	"I do need to do a full security scan of it to complete all the incident paperwork before I let it go, though, so if you have any business on-world here, please take your time.`
	"CN-12864" `	"In any event, let's hope a more permanent solution can be devised soon. In the meantime, the local dealers have decided to start selling the Ladybugs again. I hear it's something about a spike in interest among the humans here, so feel free to have a look at them. I shouldn't get too distracted though, I'm sure they'll be waiting for you back on Hai-home."`
	"CN-12865" `	With a final nod of thanks he departs to attend to his business, leaving you free to go about your own.`
	"CN-12866" `	With a final nod of thanks he departs to attend to his business, leaving you free to wander the spaceport for a couple of hours until they release your new ship.`
	"CN-12867" `When you return to Hai-home, you are greeted with a call from Sayari, who looks relieved to see you. "Captain <last>, thank you for your assistance to our security forces. They appreciated it greatly, and we should have them properly reinforced in a day or two. A few things have happened while you were away, but you haven't missed anything important yet."`
	"CN-12868" `	She smiles and says, "Your diplomatic colleagues are still working on their solutions, so I don't think there's anything for you to do right at this moment. Take a day or two, and then whenever you're ready, come to the spaceport and we'll redirect you through to the secure port. By that point we should have a plan and be able to get you up to speed with our next steps. I have no doubt that there'll be things for you to do by then, so you should be ready when you return."`
	"CN-12869" `Arriving at the secure landing area on Hai-home, you are met by a group of relieved diplomats. Of all of them, Alondo seems to be the least tired and takes the time to let you know what's been going on. "Captain <last>! You've missed quite the palaver. Still, I doubt you lost much. We've spent four hours trying to explain to Sayari what a 'furry' is."`
	"CN-12870" `	"What? That could've been entertaining."`
	"CN-12871" `	"Hmm. No, I probably didn't miss much."`
	"CN-12872" `	"Oh, I could have told her all about it..."`
	"CN-12873" `	He chuckles. "Anyway, I have a hunch that we'll need you again before too long, but for now they're putting some Hai patrols out on the other side of the wormhole with a couple of Navy observers on board to 'play the part,' as it were. We've got a plan now but there's some work to pull it off. There's some older counter-propaganda that we're leveraging to pass things off as a big budget movie production."`
	"CN-12874" `	"Sounds good. What's next?"`
	"CN-12875" `	"Oh, what's it about?"`
	"CN-12876" `	"Am I allowed to know more?"`
	"CN-12877" `	Alondo gives you a quizzical look. "Of course you are, <last>."`
	"CN-12878" `	He pulls out a hand tablet and shows you a title screen which doesn't automatically look familiar. As he talks he flicks through a series of reference images. "There's an older TV show franchise with a cult following called 'Our Fuzzy Paradise,' which has had a few different reboots and iterations over the decades. In case you haven't guessed, it features a whole cast of anthropomorphic squirrels. Most recently we had a seven season series run subtitled 'Fellowship is Glamorous' which was one of the more successful ones."`
	"CN-12879" `	"That sounds... interesting. Tell me more."`
	"CN-12880" `	"Never mind. It sounds like you have that under control. What's next?"`
	"CN-12881" `	"The production of the very first series was entirely funded through a government grants program though, as a cover for any accidental leaks about the Hai. Xilin tells me that since then it's pretty much run itself. The idea here is that since the last one was so successful, someone has decided that it's worth the risk to make a big budget movie production out of it and to potentially use that to kick off a sort of tourist trap type theme park destination. We've found a Seerwood producer who's willing to be all wounded on TV about the spoiling of his 'big surprise' release, and we're passing off the footage as leaked promotional material. For the sake of the cover, we've also decided that this project has a 'fan community' that have been hired on as a focus group to support the production for consistency and accuracy."`
	"CN-12882" `	He chuckles tiredly. "That's where the uh, furry, explanation came into things. It also probably can't hold up as a cover indefinitely. Still, things have been going very well while you've been away!`
	"CN-12883" `	"I hear you were instrumental in driving off some opportunistic pirates and helping stem the information leak. Come on, I'll buy you a drink on the others' behalf."`
	"CN-12884" `	Some hours later, you leave the fancy cocktail bar Alondo took you to and begin making your way back to your ship to sleep. Your cabin by far seems to be the best place to not be bothered.`
	"CN-12885" `	Partway there, a hooded figure suddenly falls in step beside you.`
	"CN-12886" `	(Ask them who they are.)`
	"CN-12887" `	"Sssshhhh!" says the voice at your elbow. "Do not react, and do not be alarmed, it is merely I."`
	"CN-12888" `	You look at the figure out of the corner of your eye and connect the whispered voice to the squirrelly muzzle poking out. To your surprise, it is Sayari.`
	"CN-12889" `	"I should not be coming to you with this, so you must promise to say nothing of it to anyone just yet," she says.`
	"CN-12890" `	"A very sweet friend of mine, who is much too enthusiastic and perhaps led by the vagaries of youth but nonetheless quite astute, keeps harping on to me about this theory of hers that some kind of smuggling ring is kidnapping Hai and transporting them into human space with the quiet support of one of your legal entities.`
	"CN-12891" `	"Of course, a thorough investigation has occurred on our side, and no admissible evidence of such things has turned up, but...`
	"CN-12892" `	"Well, you see we cannot investigate your space openly or easily. I have paid it little mind, written it off as one of her eccentricities, but things are very tense right now. The Council of Elders wants to maintain our secrecy and the human diplomats are willing to accommodate us, but we sense their governments grow tired of maintaining the fiction. We are well aware that human intelligence services are highly competent, and motivated by many different factors. It worries me that one of your factions may not be wholly honest, and may have knowledge they intend to use as ammunition if things don't work out well for them."`
	"CN-12893" `	You have not had much exposure to this elected "Council of Elders," but it seems they must hold some kind of final authority over decisions.`
	"CN-12894" `	"But what should I do about it?"`
	"CN-12895" `	"Are Hai kidnappings common?"`
	"CN-12896" `	"They're not. Well, it can be hard to tell sometimes, but no, I wouldn't say they're common. There have been instances in the past though where occasional pirate groups have been caught either trying or succeeding. My understanding is that those were dealt with effectively." She gives an odd shrug that is distorted by the cloak.`
	"CN-12897" `	"Still, my friend is very bright, and she is insistent that there is something beneath the noise that cannot be accounted for by normal circumstances. There has been a spike in disappearances since the leak, and not necessarily on worlds where they could be expected to have got themselves into trouble. With recent events her words have begun to trouble me, especially after that raid on Allhome. Nothing like that has ever happened before," she says.`
	"CN-12898" `	"You are well-known, and must be canny to have got where you are. A Hai in trouble might recognize you, or you might perceive them when others would not. It would be in the interests of both our people to be sure that there is no such issue. Would you look for me? For both our sakes?"`
	"CN-12899" `	"Sure, I can have a look around."`
	"CN-12900" `	She gives you a little smile and nods. "If you come across someone and have difficulty getting them to trust you, try telling them 'Luf e ow, vai, luf e eh.'"`
	"CN-12901" `	"Well, about that," you say, "I think I might have already come across some potential evidence of this before."`
	"CN-12902" `	Sayari's hood nearly slips off as she looks up at you with a horrified expression. "Surely not?!"`
	"CN-12903" `	You rush to reassure her. "Nothing concrete, of course. I can go and look to be sure."`
	"CN-12904" `	She gives you a very serious look and nods. "If you come across any others and have difficulty getting them to trust you, try telling them 'Luf e ow, vai, luf e eh.'"`
	"CN-12905" `	"Thank you, I will."`
	"CN-12906" `	"What does it mean?"`
	"CN-12907" `	She winks at you. "It would be much less effective if I told you."`
	"CN-12908" `You think you have enough evidence of kidnapped Hai to be sure of the bad news you bring. There may be other Hai you could still save, but you should go tell Sayari soon to see how to proceed.`
	"CN-12909" `As you come in to land at the spaceport, you listen to the usual chatter of captains coming and going. Often this contains useful tidbits, such as which merchants are ticked off at the moment and whether you should expect to wait a while for refueling. Today, though, you overhear a captain telling an acquaintance a remarkable tale.`
	"CN-12910" `	Apparently, there is a man-beast on <planet>, and when the other captain laughs at the idea of a modern "werewolf," the first one is quick to clarify that it's more like a meter and a half tall "were-squirrel." There seems to be some confused discussion about the mythology of such beasts being revealed when caught staring at bright lights until a third captain, listening in the same as you, butts in to inform them that one of them stole that from a popular show a few years back.`
	"CN-12911" `	You stop listening on your final approach as the conversation descends into a good-natured argument. Nevertheless, it sounds like a lead on a possible stranded Hai that would be worth following up.`
	"CN-12912" `Wandering around after dark you find yourself down an alley near the spaceport, huddled in an alcove against the drizzle while you keep an eye out for anything suspicious, apparently last rumored to be around here. After a while, a few dozen meters ahead, you see a short man with a strange necklace. As he walks past a power transfer unit, the man shimmers and you see faintly-visible, squirrel-like features. It seems the necklace is a projector of a human hologram concealing a Hai. He is sticking to the shadows, trying to avoid being seen.`
	"CN-12913" `Wandering around after dark you find yourself down an alley near the spaceport. The ongoing drizzle increases in intensity and you pause for a moment to huddle in an alcove for a while until it settles down. After a few moments, a few dozen meters ahead, you see a short man with a strange necklace. As he walks past a power transfer unit, the man shimmers and you see faintly-visible, squirrel-like features. It seems the necklace is a projector of a human hologram concealing a Hai. He is sticking to the shadows, trying to avoid being seen.`
	"CN-12914" `	Do you want to talk to him?`
	"CN-12915" `	(Talk to him.)`
	"CN-12916" `	(Come back later.)`
	"CN-12917" `	The man's expression doesn't change much as you approach. His holoprojector may not be sophisticated enough to translate Hai facial expressions. You can see exposed wires on the device; this is probably a makeshift projector he produced with limited resources. A well-made version might keep Hai hidden in human space for a long time.`
	"CN-12918" `	From the shaking voice, you can tell he's frightened.`
	"CN-12919" `	"C-can I help you?"`
	"CN-12920" `	"You're a Hai. Why are you in human space?"`
	"CN-12921" `	"Do you need a ride home to Hai space?"`
	"CN-12922" `	"How did you make that holoprojector?"`
	"CN-12923" `	He pauses and after a brief delay his hologram registers surprise, "You know what this is then?"`
	"CN-12924" `	"Yes, that's a holoprojector and you're a Hai."`
	"CN-12925" `	"Yes, I've been looking for someone like yourself."`
	"CN-12926" `	He peers at you for a second, perhaps pondering if he can trust you with the answer.`
	"CN-12927" `	"Yes, well, holography is my trade, and Hai children sometimes construct holoprojectors for fun. This one is primitive but functional, if only barely, thanks to inferior human components I've had to scavenge."`
	"CN-12928" `	"I'm from Icelake. I chartered a flight from Icelake to Allhome with my family. They would have gone on vacation while I would have been at a conference. Instead, the human merchants locked us in a cell and took us here.`
	"CN-12929" `	He pauses for a second, perhaps pondering if he can trust you with the answer.`
	"CN-12930" `	"I'm a holographer from Icelake. I chartered a flight from Icelake to Allhome with my family. They would have gone on vacation while I would have been at a conference. Instead, the human merchants locked us in a cell and took us here.`
	"CN-12931" `	"My youngest daughter is very small for her age, and was able to sneak through a vent to unlock our cell. The ship was under-crewed and so we overpowered them. Unfortunately, they had already landed and the ship was locked down. I didn't know how to disable the lock so we could not take off, and for lack of options we've been hiding near here ever since.`
	"CN-12932" `	"Can you take us back to <destination>? I have considerable savings back there and can pay you well. Say, <payment>?"`
	"CN-12933" `	"Would the Hai government be looking for you?"`
	"CN-12934" `	"No, I can't."`
	"CN-12935" `	"Thank you. My name is Duniip Yeertle, by the way. My wife and three children are nearby. They have holoprojectors as well."`
	"CN-12936" `	"Yes! Thank you. Some crooked human merchants locked us in a cell and took us here. I've been unable to find anyone who has even heard of Hai space, and I'm afraid to approach the human authorities. You're the first lead I have! I promise I'll pay you well when we return. I can afford <payment> once we're back at <destination>.`
	"CN-12937" `	"My name is Duniip Yeertle, by the way. My wife and three children are nearby. They have holoprojectors as well."`
	"CN-12938" `	The man's holographic expression doesn't change, but his body language shifts in a way that speaks of distress.`
	"CN-12939" `	"The Hai government... no. No, they wouldn't. Let's just say that it's not entirely uncommon for Hai to willingly go missing. An occasional tour of duty with the military, a thrill-seeking adventure with the hopes of getting a reaction upon returning, or even... defection to our brethren. If the authorities tried to track down every single Hai who went missing as soon as they went missing, they'd spend their time chasing their tails fruitlessly.`
	"CN-12940" `	"Doubtlessly I'm on a register somewhere, with a timer counting down. It is even possible that someone has been told to watch for if I show up on Darkcloak. Ultimately though, the authorities don't often look for missing persons, unless they're very wealthy, until at least four months have passed by. We have been gone for only two."`
	"CN-12941" `	"Well, let's get you out of here and home safely."`
	"CN-12942" `	Turns out relief is an expression his holoprojector does handle. "Thank you! My name is Duniip Yeertle, by the way. My wife and three children are nearby. They have holoprojectors as well."`
	"CN-12943" `	"Please, follow me back to my house, and we will make our preparations."`
	"CN-12944" `	You walk down a corridor to a stairway that leads to a brick wall. Duniip walks through the wall; apparently this is another of his holograms. You pass through and see a trio of energetic Hai children eating dinner with their mother.`
	"CN-12945" `	Duniip turns off his hologram and addresses his family. "I found us a pilot! They're going to take us all the way home."`
	"CN-12946" `	The whole family cheers and it turns out they were already packed to leave. Duniip explains they move regularly so they're not found. It takes them under two minutes to finish preparations and don their holoprojectors. Your walk back to the ship is largely uneventful until some men with strange scanners detect the Yeertle family. One man throws a small grenade with a green light on top. You recognize it as a low-level EMP device. All five holograms turn off, along with a nearby bank of lights, but by the time you stumble to a stop and identify the cause you're much closer to your ship than they are to you.`
	"CN-12947" `	In the sudden dimness surrounding your group, you quickly cross the remaining distance to your ship as hastily as possible before someone gets a good look at the Yeertles. Looking back, you see the men were not following you; they were running to their own ships. Looks like they're planning to follow you into orbit.`
	"CN-12948" `As you come in to land at the spaceport, you listen to the usual chatter of captains coming and going. To your surprise, on one of the lower, less obvious bands, you hear a pair of captains talking about the pirate world of <planet>. Apparently these two have enough connections to profit off the occasional trip there, but one of them is warning the other not to go by at the moment.`
	"CN-12949" `	You listen in carefully as the speaker relays that there's some kind of hunt going on there. All the ships are being searched before departure, and there's a lot of paranoid goons with weapons hot. A merchant has been killed on his own ship, while it was parked in the spaceport, and random people keep getting into firefights with a short, hooded, "angel of death" in dark alleyways. So far, no one claims to know what's going on.`
	"CN-12950" `	It's really hard to say what this could be, but it might be worth checking out.`
	"CN-12951" `Following reports of the last time the "angel of death" was sighted, you end up loitering in a twisting street parallel to a main thoroughfare. The few people using it hurry by quickly, and rarely seem to travel any great distance down this street. One very surly looking individual gives you a sour glare on his way past, a collection of weapons on full display. He looks a lot like you'd expect a bounty hunter to look, and as he moves out of sight you observe a shadow, previously motionless, detach from a spot on a wall and head back your direction, laser rifle pointed in the direction of the departing individual. As the shadow approaches, you see there's a lot of hair sticking out from their hood. They might be a Hai. Do you want to talk to them?`
	"CN-12952" `As you come in you are informed that all the ships are being searched before departure. No sooner do you disembark your ship than you notice that there's a lot of paranoid goons with weapons hot. Like a lot. There seems to be some kind of manhunt going on for a short, hooded, "angel of death" who has been loitering in dark alleyways. So far, no one is explicitly claiming to know what's going on though, and even for a place like this the effort seems... ungoverned. Even to the extent that some groups seem to be actively pretending to be involved while surreptitiously not joining in with groups that leave on the hunt.`
	"CN-12953" `	It's all very odd, but one thing you do glean from the constant conversation and the small selection of individuals loudly demanding cooperation is that the "angel of death," as they're calling it, is unusually short and fast, and capable of things which give you reason to suspect they might possibly be a Hai.`
	"CN-12954" `	(Investigate for myself.)`
	"CN-12955" `	Following reports of the last time the "angel of death" was sighted, you end up loitering in a twisting street parallel to a main thoroughfare. The few people using it hurry by quickly, and rarely seem to travel any great distance down this street. One very surly looking individual gives you a sour glare on his way past, a collection of weapons on full display. He looks a lot like you'd expect a bounty hunter to look, and as he moves out of sight you observe a shadow, previously motionless, detach from a spot on a wall and head back your direction, laser rifle pointed in the direction of the departing individual. As the shadow approaches, you see there's a lot of hair sticking out from their hood. It seems you may have indeed found a Hai. Do you want to talk to them?`
	"CN-12956" `	As you step into their path, the Hai swings the laser rifle towards you and says, "You're either very brave, very stupid, or know something... I should warn you, I'm not going back to them!"`
	"CN-12957" `	She watches your expression closely and, when you don't appear to be hostile, settles into a wary but more relaxed stance. "You're not one of them. What do you want with me?"`
	"CN-12958" `	"I was wondering why a Hai is on a pirate planet."`
	"CN-12959" `	"Not one of whom?"`
	"CN-12960" `	"Sorry to bother you. I'll leave you to your business."`
	"CN-12961" `	"I was going to meet a businessman on Shroud to arrange a large-scale import deal for my research project. I asked a human merchant to take me there, but I was tricked. The businessman doesn't really exist, and the deal was faked. The merchant locked me in a cell and brought me here instead. When he opened the cell, I managed to grab his rifle, shoot him, and hide. It's amazing how slowly humans move.`
	"CN-12962" `	"There are some men looking for me. I've managed to escape them so far; they're not as quick as a Hai. I think they're friends of the merchant who locked me up.`
	"CN-12963" `	"I have no money with me, but my family on <planet> can pay.`
	"CN-12964" `	"Can you take me back to <destination>? My family can pay for my return."`
	"CN-12965" `	"Yes, I'll take you there."`
	"CN-12966" `	"Why are you on a pirate planet?"`
	"CN-12967" `	"I'm not one of whom?"`
	"CN-12968" `	"Sorry, but you'll have to find another ride."`
	"CN-12969" `	"Good, but now I must ask, is your ship capable? Are you sure? The pirates are fully aware I am here and will likely chase you, even if you're in good standing with the local authorities. I'd rather not die on your ship."`
	"CN-12970" `	"Don't worry. I know how to dodge pirates."`
	"CN-12971" `	"I have a better ship parked somewhere else. I'll go get that first."`
	"CN-12972" `	"You should find a different ride then."`
	"CN-12973" `	She looks at you curiously. "You're a good one, aren't you? Very well, take this transmitter. When you return, come back to this area. Activate it, and I will find you. Come alone."`
	"CN-12974" `	She quickly keys something into the transmitter, and it beeps before displaying a locked icon on the screen. As soon as she has handed it over, she turns and melts down an alley which you weren't even entirely aware of. The transmitter in your hand is small, and looks custom modified. Whoever this Hai is, she's capable.`
	"CN-12975" `	You return to the twisting alleyway you first met the mysterious "angel of death" in and activate the transmitter. It's been a little while, but on your way in there was a bulletin out for her capture being broadcast, so it seems she's definitely still at large.`
	"CN-12976" `	You have to wait so long you're starting to feel silly, before she suddenly drops in front of you; a rappel rope swinging silently above her head. "Good, you have returned, are you ready to go?"`
	"CN-12977" `	"I'm ready."`
	"CN-12978" `	"I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous for me to get you out of here."`
	"CN-12979" `	"Okay. I guess I should have introduced myself... it's easy to forget social niceties in a place like this. My name is Ooonem, and I'm a researcher from <planet>. Thank you for agreeing to take me home."`
	"CN-12980" `	The pair of you, at her direction, make your way back to your ship, with you quietly greasing the palms of those at one of the many access points to the spaceport. Despite your precautions, though, as you weave between parked ships on your final approach, you notice several men sitting on a nearby ship's loading ramp looking intently at Ooonem, their guns lying close by. Before the men are able to make a grab for their weapons, Ooonem pulls a gas grenade out of her cloak and throws it at the gunmen in one smooth movement. The grenade lands squarely on the ramp, sending a fine mist all around their ship. The men, hands halfway to their weapons, all drop to the ground instead; from the screams of pain and the sounds of convulsion coming from behind you, they're probably not going to trouble you any longer.`
	"CN-12981" `	"I had better leave these behind," she says, dropping a few gas grenades on the ground. "I took them off some pirates a few days ago. They're quite illegal." You notice a label on the grenades: "Sarin Gas: twenty-meter radius." This was a nerve gas grenade that uses one of the older varieties of the gas. They're cheap and plentiful in pirate space.`
	"CN-12982" `	You quickly board your ship and immediately take off.`
	"CN-12983" `	The woman shakes her head at you and runs off into the shadows. You doubt you'll ever see her again.`
	"CN-12984" `As you come in to land at the spaceport, you listen to the usual chatter of captains coming and going. Out here on the edge of things and toward the Core, it is a popular pastime for merchants to swap ghost stories. In all likelihood, the majority of these stories can be put down to minor failures from cheap, mass-produced Syndicate equipment. Nevertheless, one of them stands out this time.`
	"CN-12985" `	It seems a handful of merchants have all been picking up a very faint distress signal in the vicinity of <planet>, but every time they've gone to look for it, they've either experienced some kind of engine warning, or a large group of pirates has jumped into the system, and they've bugged out. Mysteriously the pirates don't seem to have been looking for or pursuing the merchants when they've appeared though.`
	"CN-12986" `	It seems like a long-shot, but you wonder if perhaps this might be a legitimate call for help, maybe from someone who can't risk broadcasting themselves too aggressively...`
	"CN-12987" `As you set your landing vector, you detect a very faint distress call directed at your ship. Your scanners show it appears to come from a remote island. Do you want to check it out?`
	"CN-12988" `	(Follow the distress signal.)`
	"CN-12989" `	(Ignore it and come back later.)`
	"CN-12990" `	You put your ship down in a forest clearing and step out to find some wary-looking Hai with a directional transmitter and a very broken freighter in pirate colors.`
	"CN-12991" `	One of them, a lady, steps forward, and as she does so her face lights up as if she's seen you before. "Captain <last>, Captain <last>! Please help us, we need to get home to <destination>!"`
	"CN-12992" `	"Do you want to know anything else, or can we leave now?"`
	"CN-12993" `	"Of course. Let's go."`
	"CN-12994" `	"How do you know who I am?"`
	"CN-12995" `	"How did you get here?"`
	"CN-12996" `	"Sorry, maybe another time."`
	"CN-12997" `	"You don't remember me? I was the first Hai you met. You were so confused back then and didn't know who or what we were. It was very cute.`
	"CN-12998" `	"There are prison role-play cruises in Hai space where we can ride in a brig with human security guards. My research group thought it would be a fun experience, so we all chartered one," she says.`
	"CN-12999" `	"Unfortunately, it was a trick! They were pirates and took us into human space instead. They didn't feed us much, so we all pretended to be too weak to stand. When one of the pirates came in to check on us, we overpowered him. I don't know if they got sloppy or if they were just new at this, but it seems they had forgotten how fast we can be. The other pirate set the ship to crash-land and used an escape pod. Now we're stuck here.`
	"CN-13000" `	"Ah, well, we can give you what is left of our travel budget: <payment>. The money is on <planet> though, so you'll have to fly us there first.`
	"CN-13001" `	"Excellent! Everyone pile aboard. Let's go back to <planet>!"`
	"CN-13002" `As you come in to land at the spaceport, you listen to the usual chatter of captains coming and going. You don't hear anything specific to Hai, but when the punchline of a joke is "deep crevasses" on <planet>, it occurs to you that there would be the perfect place for both illicit activities and escapees to hide out under the radar for a long time. It's probably worth a look...`
	"CN-13003" `As you walk through a major street, you notice a woman approach an alcove in the side of a building carrying some food. She looks around to see if she's being followed before entering the alcove and covering it with a sheet of steel. You only had a moment to observe, but through the gap you spotted something hiding inside the small alcove which might have had tufts of hair sticking out of the clothing across its body. It's probably a Hai.`
	"CN-13004" `	Do you want to investigate?`
	"CN-13005" `	You knock on the steel sheet, and a woman within the alcove slides it to the side. As she emerges, she carefully moves her body to block your view of the alcove.`
	"CN-13006" `	She asks nervously, "Yes, can I help you?"`
	"CN-13007" `	"Why are you hiding a Hai in there?"`
	"CN-13008" `	"No, I was just walking by. Sorry to bother you."`
	"CN-13009" `	Her expression immediately takes on a shade of panic and you hear what sounds like something heavy being picked up in the background. "Please don't tell anyone! We were both kidnapped, but we managed to escape. Now we're hiding here, hoping those people don't find us again."`
	"CN-13010" `	"Yes! Some men kidnapped my friend and I, but she got us out and we managed to escape. We've been hiding here, hoping they don't find us again."`
	"CN-13011" `	In the background you hear someone hiss, "Lucy! What are you doing, we can't trust them!"`
	"CN-13012" `	"Uh, luf e ow, vai, luf e eh?"`
	"CN-13013" `	"No really, you can trust me, I promise!"`
	"CN-13014" `	Lucy's face goes pale and she seems frozen in shock, while in the background you can hear sounds of someone who is definitely rushing to do something, though you can't see what.`
	"CN-13015" `	"No wait! Luf e ow, vai, luf e eh?"`
	"CN-13016" `	The person in the background stills. "What did you say?"`
	"CN-13017" `	You repeat the phrase.`
	"CN-13018" `	Somewhere out of sight you hear a string of Hai words that sound very exasperated before they address Lucy again. "Let them in, Lucy, they probably are here to help."`
	"CN-13019" `	The emphasis placed on the "are" is thick, and it seems to snap Lucy out of her frozen state. "Oh, uh, yes, alright. If you could fly us to <planet>, we can pay you when we arrive. You'll likely be followed though, so I hope you have a fast ship. I think you should probably come in, and we'll talk about it."`
	"CN-13020" `	(Enter their alcove.)`
	"CN-13021" `	"No, I can't help you get home."`
	"CN-13022" `	The alcove is a dead air space between two utility rooms in the basement of a warehouse. The hole in the wall looks like it was recently dug out by a laser cutter. There's a small refrigerator, a two-person cot, an air processor, and a shelf with typical household items. Books are strewn everywhere; the women must be avid readers. It seems they've set up this tiny space as a decent, albeit very small, apartment.`
	"CN-13023" `	The human woman slides the sheet of steel back into place behind you both once you're in and says, "I'm Lucy."`
	"CN-13024" `	"And I'm Meroot," adds the Hai woman. "I was on Newhome walking to my research lab when some men pulled me into an alley and zapped me with a taser. I woke up in the brig of a spaceship."`
	"CN-13025" `	"My experience was similar. I was walking from my biolab to my house on Serpens. Some men jumped out from behind a dune and zapped me."`
	"CN-13026" `	Meroot continues, "They took us both here. I was able to struggle out of my handcuffs and sneak the keys from the guard. We escaped together, and we've been hiding for weeks. Please take us to <destination>!"`
	"CN-13027" `	"Sure. Let's go."`
	"CN-13028" `	"No, you'll have to find another pilot."`
	"CN-13029" `	The two women put on clothing that thoroughly covers their persons. They lead you through a series of ducts and alleys back to the pad where your ship is parked. Just as your airlock opens there's a sharp zapping sound as someone shoots Meroot with a stun gun. You and Lucy duck, and a couple other shots dissipate harmlessly on the bulkhead of your ship. You fire off a couple shots back and, between the two of you, manage to drag Meroot through the airlock, seal it behind you, and lift off. It appears you're being followed into orbit.`
	"CN-13030" `As you come in to land at the spaceport, you listen to the usual chatter of captains coming and going. One guy is bragging particularly odiously about some lucrative transport jobs he'd picked up on <planet>. Of course, it could mean nothing, but it's also very suspicious for that particular world. <planet> is not known for lucrative transport jobs, and it could likely be contraband, or worse...`
	"CN-13031" `As you come in to land one guy is on the comms, bragging particularly odiously about some lucrative transport jobs he'd picked up. This catches your attention only because <origin> is not known for lucrative transport jobs. It could likely be contraband, or worse...`
	"CN-13032" `After some quiet investigation you find out that all the lucrative transport jobs are coming out of one particular warehouse. The paperwork all looks to be in order, but to be sure you should pick up a job yourself.`
	"CN-13033" `	Surprisingly, when you arrive the warehouse is unattended, which is suspicious in and of itself. Poking around a little you walk by some cargo and hear loud thumping coming from a locked crate. A ring of keys is hanging nearby. Someone could appear at any moment and you could be in trouble. Do you want to check it out?`
	"CN-13034" `	(Examine the crate.)`
	"CN-13035" `	One key stands out, it has a symbol you don't recognize that looks like an angry cat in a circle. As you get closer to the thumping, the ordinary-looking crate starts to seem a little strange. At first glance it appears to be the sort of crate that is well-insulated against sound and temperature, but this one must have concealed breathing holes. You can still hear muffled thumping fairly clearly, but outside you hear what sounds like a loading vehicle pull up, and you don't know what's in the crate.`
	"CN-13036" `	Do you want to try opening the crate?`
	"CN-13037" `	You put the key in the lock, turn, and the next thump you hear pushes the crate open so hard it falls over. An angry-looking Hai jumps out and starts yelling at you in its own language.`
	"CN-13038" `	After a few seconds, the Hai calms down and speaks in your tongue. "They locked me in a box! I was walking home from a store on <planet>, and some humans pulled me into an alley. They shoved me in a box and now I'm..." the Hai pauses and looks around, "not in Hai space?`
	"CN-13039" `	"Please take me home. I'm a ship architect from <planet>. We should hurry before they come back."`
	"CN-13040" `	"Of course. Just hop in my ship."`
	"CN-13041" `	"No, I'm not going that way any time soon."`
	"CN-13042" `	He makes a frustrated sound in the back of his throat and gives you a pointed and pleading look. "I have nowhere else to go! I'm not exactly inconspicuous. I'll be caught soon. Please, I can pay you well."`
	"CN-13043" `	"In that case, I'll take you."`
	"CN-13044" `	"No. You'll have to find another pilot."`
	"CN-13045" `	You can hear men approaching through the warehouse entry and the Hai quickly retrieves something from the crate before you both run quickly in the other direction. Soon you hear shots fired, and see them hit a nearby wall. They passed quite close to your head.`
	"CN-13046" `	Through luck and skill, the two of you make it to your ship and quickly launch. The escape seemed a little too easy though; they may have been taking pains to avoid hitting your new passenger.`
	"CN-13047" `	It appears ships are following you into orbit.`
	"CN-13048" `When you return to Hai-home, you are directed to a government hangar where you are met by Xilin and Sayari, both looking very relieved.`
	"CN-13049" `	"I am very glad to see you returned, Captain <last>. Sayari said you were away on an important errand, but I've been hoping for a day now that you would reappear. I think you might be the solution to the current impasse."`
	"CN-13050" `	"You see," says Sayari, "while you've been away it's been decided that a 'tourist trap type theme park destination' is a critical part of the cover story." Despite her Hai inflections, you can still hear the air quotes around that phrase in the tone of her voice. "So far it seems the movie cover has been circulating quite successfully, so we're leaning into it.`
	"CN-13051" `	"This means we need a station, on your side of the wormhole in Ultima Thule. It also means we need it fast, much faster than your people could ever hope to assemble it. The Hai can build it much quicker than humanity can; we actually considered the possibility of needing to raise a station quickly a while back. The alien look that the station will have if we build it has been considered just another favorable aspect of the movie and it provides a long-term commercial justification for the whole idea; the, uh, 'tourist trap.'"`
	"CN-13052" `	"It would help if I oversaw the construction, wouldn't it?"`
	"CN-13053" `	"Good idea. Let me know when the station is complete."`
	"CN-13054" `	"It's not so simple," Sayari responds. "In the light of the recent civil war your species has had, some of the Elders are less than keen on allowing a partisan observer to see the inner workings of a station in its earliest phases, especially when we haven't actually built one in so, so long."`
	"CN-13055" `	Now that she mentions it, all of the stations in Hai space do seem to be very, very old.`
	"CN-13056" `	"However, therein lies a problem," says Xilin.`
	"CN-13057" `	"The Republic will not allow the Hai to build a station on our side of the wormhole without some oversight by someone we trust. This has now been a point of contention for some days, and multiple suggestions have been rejected."`
	"CN-13058" `	Sayari chitters, "Honestly, it's all very silly. Lots of old men, who are meant to be friends, concerned that the other might have been lying to them."`
	"CN-13059" `	In an oddly comical gesture, they both shrug at the same time.`
	"CN-13060" `	"Anyway," she continues, "thanks to a little Freedom of Information request to the Republic, I have been looking at things, and I think I have the solution."`
	"CN-13061" `	"Is it me?"`
	"CN-13062" `	Sayari winks at you. "Catch on quick, don't you? The actions you're recorded as having taken show a certain conscience for the good of your species as a whole, despite your affiliations. I have convinced the other diplomats and our Elders that you might be a viable solution to this impasse. The human diplomats have already agreed, but the Elders wish to speak with you first."`
	"CN-13063" `	"You're learning to navigating the maze of galactic politics quickly, Captain <last>," says Sayari. "We are at an impasse. The Elders are less than keen on allowing a partisan observer to see the construction."`
	"CN-13064" `	Xilin continues her thought. "The Republic won't let the Hai build a station on our side of the wormhole without a trusted observer monitoring construction.`
	"CN-13065" `	"Both sides trust you, though," he says, as Sayari nods.`
	"CN-13066" `	"Who are these Elders?"`
	"CN-13067" `	"Of course, that's natural."`
	"CN-13068" `	Sayari explains, "The Hai are ruled by an elected council of elders. They are not responsible for every administrative decision that occurs, but they are the highest authority of our government. Their decisions are final, at least for the term of an election."`
	"CN-13069" `	Xilin addresses you, "Not a great deal of progress has been made in your absence. We have maintained our position, so the other diplomats and the Elders still accept that you might be a viable solution to this impasse. It is unavoidable though that the Elders must speak with you first."`
	"CN-13070" `	"If you're willing, there will be a council meeting in an hour, and I can put you first on the agenda. Will you do this?" asks Sayari.`
	"CN-13071" `	"I suppose I must."`
	"CN-13072" `	"Someone better be paying me for this."`
	"CN-13073" `	"Of course, let's do it."`
	"CN-13074" `	"Maybe in a bit. I should do something else first."`
	"CN-13075" `	Following Sayari, you pass beyond a security checkpoint where Xilin is prevented from following you. Sayari speaks with another Hai doing administrative work for a moment before gesturing you towards a private antechamber.`
	"CN-13076" `	"We shouldn't have to wait very long, but while we're alone," she says, glancing at the door as if faintly nervous for a second, "did you find anything on your investigation?"`
	"CN-13077" `	"Yes, I found several Hai that had been kidnapped."`
	"CN-13078" `	"I found something out of place on Maelstrom."`
	"CN-13079" `	"I found a symbol being used with a captured Hai in a registered warehouse."`
	"CN-13080" `	Sayari looks crestfallen as you list off the Hai that you found, but as you finish describing the situations she frowns contemplatively. "That seems to be more Hai, and more easily found than I would have expected. It would seem that the problem may be larger than we've previously thought possible... but was that it? Was there nothing unusual?"`
	"CN-13081" `	"Maelstrom is a significant world, a lot of important corporations obtain their raw materials from there and keep an eye on its operations," she muses. "If there's something going on there it doesn't bode well, we'll have to investigate it."`
	"CN-13082" `	She glances at the door, as if having heard something you didn't, before giving you an appraising look. "I trust you have recorded all this in some capacity that you can give to me?"`
	"CN-13083" `	When you show her the symbol an odd expression flashes over her face for the briefest of moments, there and gone so quickly that you could've blinked and missed it. "Yes, this is a very odd symbol, and not one I associate with any known groups. I will have to investigate and show this to my friend. See if it matches anything she's found."`
	"CN-13084" `	She glances at the door, as if having heard something you didn't, and gestures for you to quickly put your data pad away. "I trust you have recorded all this in some capacity that you can give to me?"`
	"CN-13085" `	You hand Sayari a data stick. "I saved everything from my logs on this."`
	"CN-13086" `	Gingerly, she takes the data stick and secretes it away on her person. Her expression of distaste looks like one she might give to some snake that could bite her at any moment.`
	"CN-13087" `	"I will have a thorough look later," is all she says.`
	"CN-13088" `	No sooner has she finished than there is a knock at the door, and an aide looks in. "The Council will see you now."`
	"CN-13089" `	(Walk into the Council chambers.)`
	"CN-13090" `	The next twenty minutes prove to be an exercise in tedium as various members of the council interrogate you over apparently mundane details of your recent actions as recorded in the Freedom of Information report. You're not really sure what most of it has to do with anything, but eventually one of the Elders stands up.`
	"CN-13091" `	"I think we've generally had enough of this here. Answer me two questions, and then we shall make our decision. Firstly, do you think that a diplomatic post should be able to defend itself? Or should it trust to the strength of those who meet there to ensure its protection?"`
	"CN-13092" `	This seems like a very strange question...`
	"CN-13093" `	"It should be strong enough to defend itself. You cannot trust your enemy."`
	"CN-13094" `	"Both sides must be trusted to protect a diplomatic post, or there is no point to having one."`
	"CN-13095" `	You seem to get no reaction, and the Elder follows up with, "What is the gravest threat, in your opinion, facing humanity?"`
	"CN-13096" `	"The Pug."`
	"CN-13097" `	"The Alphas."`
	"CN-13098" `	"Unknown jump-capable aliens."`
	"CN-13099" `	"Experimental technologies."`
	"CN-13100" `	"Humanity's hubris."`
	"CN-13101" `	There is a collection of chittering laughs from the various council members. You're not sure if there was something wrong with what you said, but you aren't left long to ponder.`
	"CN-13102" `	"It seems the human agent is an honest fool, but an honest fool can at least be trusted to be foolish honestly on all fronts."`
	"CN-13103" `	You're pretty sure you should be offended by that, but the council members are smiling and don't look like they're about to evict you.`
	"CN-13104" `	"It seems you learned the correct lesson from the crisis of your species," he says.`
	"CN-13105" `	You see several appreciative nods happening around the room out of the corner of your eyes.`
	"CN-13106" `	"You may act as the oversight for the human governments in this project. Proposal D-86513-7P4 is approved. Our Council is adjourned."`
	"CN-13107" `	When you meet Sayari afterwards, a touch of her usual enthusiasm returns as you share the news.`
	"CN-13108" `	"This is fantastic news. Now all that remains to be done is for you to escort the construction fleet from <stopovers> to Ultima Thule and observe the initial stages. They'll be waiting for your arrival."`
	"CN-13109" `On arrival, you see one of the Geocoris deploy a steel ring around itself. Space-based cranes unfold and set about removing the three outer sections of the Geocoris and moving them to the ring. After they finish with the first, they progressively dismantle the other seven Geocoris you escorted. Within a few hours, there is a makeshift station with eight Geocoris' power generators and a sizable amount of storage and habitat space. The construction workers begin unpacking the contents of the Geocoris' storage pods, checking construction seals, engaging principle life support systems, and erecting a massive holoprojector.`
	"CN-13110" `	The Geocoris' captains explain that the Hai had conceived this space station option when the Geocoris was first designed, with some station construction principles used to support its massive cargo capacity. With minor modifications, it was made a trivial effort to dismantle eight Geocoris and rapidly assemble a station. They thank you for your service and inform you that the Hai government needs your help again.`
	"CN-13111" `	Content that the station is built satisfactorily, you prepare to return to <planet>.`
	"CN-13112" `At Hai-home, you are directed to a now familiar government hangar. Sayari, Xilin, and Alondo all send you greeting pings, but are busy at the time of your landing. To your surprise though, Terry is banging on your airlock before too long.`
	"CN-13113" `	"Captain <last>, or should I call you <first>? Anyway, doesn't matter. How would you like to make some money?" The smile she gives you is something like you imagine a large cat giving the tasty morsel it just identified as its food. "Of course you do, everyone likes to make money," she continues, not waiting for you to reply.`
	"CN-13114" `	"The Hai have put out the call for volunteers to be actors in the movie production and also to staff the new Mountaintop station when it's finished, but there's a problem."`
	"CN-13115" `	"What's the problem?"`
	"CN-13116" `	"The movie production is real?"`
	"CN-13117" `	She looks and blinks at you as if caught slightly off-guard. "Yes, didn't they tell you? In order to keep up the cover they actually have to start making a movie, or at least believable clips from one. The director they found, an eccentric chap called David Cohen, seems to have got quite enthusiastic now he's not busy bemoaning the 'big reveal' of his 'secret project.' There's a Mr Turner who's now the cover story's guy bankrolling the thing.`
	"CN-13118" `	"That's Sam's business though, and he can do that without a secretary. I'm dealing with the operational side of things, as I should be." Something in the tilt of her head gives you the sense that she's supremely satisfied with this turn of events.`
	"CN-13119" `	"While you've been watching early construction, we've been gauging public interest and... at the moment it's not going to work. In order to sell this, they're going to need at least four thousand volunteers by the end of the month, and twelve thousand by the time the station is built. We have to cover crews, staff, roles, extras; gauge needs for facilities, amenities, supplies, and livability requirements. We estimate they'll only get a third of that unless something changes."`
	"CN-13120" `	As she's talking, Terry has been laying out charts and graphs while using a handheld Hai holographic device to show animated diagrams.`
	"CN-13121" `	"The problem is that we need Hai who know how to interact with humans. We've had no shortage of Hai who are keen, even excited, at the prospect of acting in a human movie. Unfortunately, well, many of those Hai... have never met a human in their life. There's something off about their mannerisms and the way they interact; they're simply too alien... No one is going to believe that they're the result of motion capture in the movie, especially the staff and extras."`
	"CN-13122" `	"How do you know all this?"`
	"CN-13123" `	"How do we make them less alien?"`
	"CN-13124" `	Terry raises an eyebrow at you. "The Oracle may have been an AI supercomputer that could predict the economic situation across the whole of human-inhabited space up to fifteen years in the future, but it was still dependent on our incredibly developed data gathering, reporting, and collation infrastructure. With or without it, the Syndicate knows data. How else do you think we're so profitable?"`
	"CN-13125" `	When she puts it that way, it does suddenly feel like a bit of a stupid question.`
	"CN-13126" `	"As it turns out, that infrastructure is predicting that the Syndicate stands to lose billions of credits, per day, for the duration of any crisis evolving from this which involves the uncontrolled release of the Hai secret. However, we have a plan."`
	"CN-13127" `	Terry snorts and suppresses a smirk. "We don't. It takes years of sharing a society with humans for a Hai to learn how to code-switch their body language for us, and humans that have lived solely with Hai and no other human contact are equally unsuitable. No, we cannot make unsuitable volunteers less alien. There's a different approach that can work though."`
	"CN-13128" `	"And that is?"`
	"CN-13129" `	"What's the deal then?"`
	"CN-13130" `	Terry crosses her arms and leans back against the bulkhead. "We need a recruitment campaign. We need to attract Hai who've lived in shared urban environments with humans enough to be able to fake being humans pretending to be Hai. Which means we need a human touch to this; it can't just come from the Hai's own advertising networks, and we need some star power. Oh, and if you haven't guessed already, you're the one to do it. The Syndicate will offer you a sum of 10,000,000 credits to visit every planet in Hai space and do glossies. I'll obviously stage-manage your image, and will have promotional material ready inside of 3 hours."`
	"CN-13131" `	"That's it? Straight into it?"`
	"CN-13132" `	She stares you down. "Right now you are the linchpin. Potentially the only human in the entire galaxy that stands between peace and crisis... and we're already behind schedule."`
	"CN-13133" `	"I don't really have a choice in this matter, do I?"`
	"CN-13134" `	Terry's answering grin is best described as "predatory."`
	"CN-13135" `You have finally visited every world in Hai space and sold the pitch to the people. With any luck, enough will sign up to make it work. Terry indicates that you may now take her to Mountaintop without further stops, but then adds, "I do have some leftover materials though, so I'll get you to do some final spruiking if you stop anywhere else along the way."`
	"CN-13136" `You land on the world of <planet> and do your part to sell the opportunity on Mountaintop.`
	"CN-13137" `You land on the world of <planet> and do your part to sell the opportunity on Mountaintop. Despite the enthusiasm of the Hai, it's tediously repetitive by now.`
	"CN-13138" `You land on the world of <planet> and do your part to sell the opportunity on Mountaintop. The routine is well-practiced now but starting to get a little tiresome.`
	"CN-13139" `You land on the world of <planet> and do your part to sell the opportunity on Mountaintop. You struggle to maintain a cheerful and enthusiastic facade as you count down the minutes until this ordeal is over.`
	"CN-13140" `You land on the world of <planet> and do your part to sell the opportunity on Mountaintop. Why did you ever agree to this interminable dog and pony show? Is it really worth all this just to save one tiny little galaxy?`
	"CN-13141" `You land on the world of <planet> and do your part to sell the opportunity on Mountaintop. You're pretty sure you've done this more times than there are habitable planets in Hai space. Did you lose track and repeat a world? Will this nightmare ever end?`
	"CN-13142" `You land on the world of <planet> and do your part to sell the opportunity on Mountaintop. Terry makes good on her promise of forcing you to shuffle out and do some last-minute spruiking to offload the remaining promotional materials to those who missed it the first time.`
	"CN-13143" `As you and Terry offload her remaining supplies on Mountaintop where she intends to manage the arrivals and setup personally, you get a communication from Sayari on your personal device.`
	"CN-13144" `	"Captain <last>! Glad I could get a hold of you on the other side of the wormhole there. I see the new relays are working. We've just discovered a problem: interest has soared in sign-ups for Mountaintop, but we've realized that most of our 'human' furnishings produced in Hai space aren't going to pass as having been manufactured with your technology. Mr Yang has pulled some strings, but now we urgently need someone to go pick them up from Prime in Betelgeuse. Everything else should be ready on our end soon enough, so if you can just handle that pick-up and delivery, we'll be okay."`
	"CN-13145" `	You let her know you'll handle it and prepare to leave.`
	"CN-13146" `By the time you return, you are shocked to notice that the station seems to be rapidly approaching a completed state. Some four thousand people have already arrived, though some are still on board ships docked at the station. Once you register your delivery amidst the station chaos, it's only a few minutes later that you get a "thank you" message from Sayari.`
	"CN-13147" `	The note is short, but accompanies a surprising amount of credits. "Captain <last> - Thank you for your prompt assistance, but I fear I must now ask it again. A friend of mine who leads an organization investigating interactions with Hai and pirates needs help in human space. I can vouch for her and her organization, and I implore you to trade information and resources to solve our pirate troubles. Please keep quiet about this, lest it spark a diplomatic event.`
	"CN-13148" `	"She will contact you soon."`
	"CN-13149" `Before you leave, Alondo finds you in a hallway. "Captain <last>, come with me. We need to have a quick conference." You follow him to an unusual room with strange padding on all sides. He plugs a device with an attached keyboard into a wall-mounted monitor and types for a few seconds. Soon after, you see the familiar face of Katya.`
	"CN-13150" `	"The transmission is secure," Alondo says. "This room has good soundproofing and some signal dampening. You can talk freely."`
	"CN-13151" `	"What is it, Katya?"`
	"CN-13152" `	"You've taken a lot of precautions for this call."`
	"CN-13153" `	"Yes," she says. "This is a sensitive matter.`
	"CN-13154" `	"There's a problem I need you to solve... discreetly. The Free Worlds have seen pirates with Hai weapons for quite a while. Most weapons were on ships, but recently we've found a large stock in a warehouse on an anarchist world.`
	"CN-13155" `	"There's a problem I need you to solve... discreetly. The Free Worlds have seen pirates with Hai weapons for quite a while. I know you fought the pirate ship Silverhawk back before the war. We know now that it had Hai outfits. Recently we've found a large stock in a warehouse on an anarchist world.`
	"CN-13156" `	"Such a vast supply is unlikely to have come from individual smugglers, so we must assume it's the result of a large-scale operation. I'm worried the Hai government may be arming pirates. If they are, I hope the weapons are just misguided tribute payments. In the south, we well know how useful bounties and tributes are when dealing with pirates, but from my time as a councilor, I can tell you the Republic will not be so understanding.`
	"CN-13157" `	"You must discreetly find out if the Hai government is arming the pirates and, if they are, put a stop to it. Don't tell them the Free Worlds asked you to do it, and whatever you do, don't let the Republic know. It could lead to an explosive diplomatic incident."`
	"CN-13158" `	"A diplomat called Sayari told me she has a friend looking into 'interactions between Hai and pirates' who should contact me soon."`
	"CN-13159" `	"A trusted Hai contact of mine has friends that can help with the investigation. She also asked for discretion."`
	"CN-13160" `	"That's worrying news. I'll look into it."`
	"CN-13161" `	"Don't worry. I'll stop the Hai from arming pirates."`
	"CN-13162" `	"I'll pursue that lead and see where it takes me."`
	"CN-13163" `	"If you vouch for her, then I'll trust her too."`
	"CN-13164" `	"Don't worry, I'm good for this secret agent stuff."`
	"CN-13165" `	You explain about the note from a diplomat who also asked for "discretion."`
	"CN-13166" `	"A lead already! That sounds promising," says Katya.`
	"CN-13167" `	You explain about the note from Sayari who also asked for "discretion."`
	"CN-13168" `	Katya seems surprised. "Sayari! Can you describe her?"`
	"CN-13169" `	You explain Sayari's appearance to Katya and she responds, "Sayari has a long history of keeping peace between Hai and humans, longer than I've been alive. If she knows there are weapon deals, then I expect she wants to stop them. Still, be careful."`
	"CN-13170" `	"Thank you," says Alondo, "Just remember this is a secret mission. Go about your business normally and look for your opportunity. You may have to be quite patient to get this done."`
	"CN-13171" `	Alondo chuckles. "You're full of surprises, aren't you? Good to know you're confident in your skills though."`
	"CN-13172" `	After a few goodbyes, you head out to search for answers.`
	"CN-13173" `You receive a high priority communication from a Hai woman named Teeneep. The message is brief and cryptic, but you deduce that it refers to the Hai you've rescued from human space in the past. It advises that she needs to talk to you as soon as possible. There is a set of landing coordinates on the uninhabited Hai planet, <planet>.`
	"CN-13174" `You follow the landing coordinates to a flat area of hardened dirt near a cave. A Hai Centipede is parked next to you; it draws your attention immediately as it is equipped with some non-standard human outfits. You can see the emission components of a scram drive sticking out the back, and the collection prongs of a Catalytic Ramscoop. The steering is Hai, but the thrusters are human. The ship appears ready to fly rapidly through unfriendly territory without stopping.`
	"CN-13175" `	(Walk into the cave.)`
	"CN-13176" `	You walk twenty meters into the cave before coming up to a concrete wall that fills up the entirety of the cavity. An open door passes through to an unmanned security post, until it finally leads into a small and roughly designed underground facility. Through some large windows immediately to the left, you can see a room containing a variety of medical machinery, while off to the right there are computers arrayed around a makeshift living area and some sleeping quarters. You notice that some of the people you've rescued are present, but there are many more humans and Hai you haven't met, some armed with Pulse Rifles. Despite all this, your attention is quickly captured by a Hai woman walking towards you.`
	"CN-13177" `	"Greetings Captain <last>, my name is Teeneep Goot'r. I'm a social advocate among the Hai, and I'm trying to help your friends with a problem. As you know, they were kidnapped by humans. A few other Hai and human victims are here; they were mostly rescued by other kind merchants in human space, but around half of those here are my staff." As she speaks she directs you to some seats that are just far enough away from the other people in the room to confer at least the illusion of privacy.`
	"CN-13178" `	"My organization has been researching the disappearance of Hai ever since humans began disappearing here under similar circumstances. We've discovered some patterns to these abductions, and through those we've been able to reach some of the victims more quickly upon their return, and even rescue some ourselves. But we have noticed something strange among the abductees: those Hai that you rescued, and several others, too, are all experiencing mild cadmium poisoning."`
	"CN-13179" `	Teeneep is your best lead so far on Hai arming pirates, and this may be your only option for information. It's time to ask, but perhaps this calls for a careful choice of words.`
	"CN-13180" `	"Before we discuss that, can you tell me if the Hai government is arming pirates?"`
	"CN-13181" `	"It sounds like something I can help with, but there's something I need from you first."`
	"CN-13182" `	She seems quite familiar with the practice of trading information, as she simply says, "What do you need?"`
	"CN-13183" `	Teeneep and the other Hai seem shocked. After a surprised exclamation in Hai, she says, "What!?"`
	"CN-13184" `	The Hai laugh for a while until they notice your face. "Oh, you're not joking," says Teeneep.`
	"CN-13185" `	You explain about pirates having Hai weapons, and about a "trusted source" that told you about an entire warehouse of them.`
	"CN-13186" `	"That's... worrying, but the Elders are pacifists to a fault, so I can't imagine them doing it. It is more likely that smugglers took it there, or ordinary pilots sold their used Hai gear. Do you have more evidence?"`
	"CN-13187" `	After you describe what Sayari said about Hai pirate deals, Teeneep shakes her head and says, "Sayari would put a stop to any weapon deals. I'm sure it's something innocuous, like cash or basic supplies for their anarchist worlds.`
	"CN-13188" `	"If you find solid proof that our government is arming pirates, I can, and will, stop them. There are extreme legal maneuvers civilians can use to force the Elder Council to change their minds.`
	"CN-13189" `	"In the meantime, can you help me?"`
	"CN-13190" `	"How do you know so much about the disappearances?"`
	"CN-13191" `	"Why are you on an uninhabited planet?"`
	"CN-13192" `	"Is anyone helping you?"`
	"CN-13193" `	"What patterns have you noticed in the disappearances?"`
	"CN-13194" `	"Tell me about the cadmium poisoning."`
	"CN-13195" `	"How long have the disappearances been happening?"`
	"CN-13196" `	"That's enough information. How can I help you?"`
	"CN-13197" `	Teeneep looks at you as if you were daft. "Kidnappers have no reason to search an uninhabited planet for potential victims. This gives us a safe place to hide critical people or information. If there is a coordinated kidnapping effort as we suspect, they would track down threats to the operation, like escaped victims or our organization. We have plenty of space here to do our work without precautions that would be necessary on a populated planet."`
	"CN-13198" `	A Hai in a medical uniform explains. "The victims each have been exposed to airborne cadmium particles, which must have been circulating through a ship's ventilation. Although the level of exposure is quite low, after being rescued we can detect clearly elevated levels in many who were taken.`
	"CN-13199" `	"No known human or Hai ship technology exhausts these particles. There are some Hai medical microbots that leave behind something similar, but not quite the same, and those are microbots are self-contained for disposal. We believe this is coming from another race's technology."`
	"CN-13200" `	They share a glance with Teeneep, "We have our suspicions but they're not conclusive yet."`
	"CN-13201" `	"We were able to look at the scan of that modified Geocoris you recovered. It has self-repair systems that use technology which could be responsible for something like this, and we suspect they came from the same place."`
	"CN-13202" `	"First, you must understand that violent crimes in Hai space are not a rare thing, though they aren't a day-to-day part of life as in human space. Murder, assault, estranged parents kidnapping their children, all of that happens here. Some Hai go on an adventure one day and then fall in a crevasse or get eaten by a beast. Some join the Unfettered but don't tell anyone. Most cases are solved: the person is found dead or alive. Sometimes, though, no person or body is ever found."`
	"CN-13203" `	"In recent years, a disproportionate number of Hai and human disappearances are from the intelligentsia: doctors, scientists, engineers, architects. Most were specialists within their field. None were prominent enough for their departure to send shock waves in the community though. Some disappeared from worlds where we'd expect to be able to track them to their general area, but instead, they are simply... gone.`
	"CN-13204" `	"We believe someone is kidnapping researchers and specialists and trying to hide it beneath the noise."`
	"CN-13205" `	Teeneep answers, "In human space, we don't know, but after collating records in Hai space it seems to have happened in three spates each lasting several years. The earliest date back to only about a decade after we made contact with humans, but the circumstances and types of victims varied over the years. This means that we can't even say for sure if the same people are behind it, but every investigation has ultimately dead-ended with similar difficulties."`
	"CN-13206" `	"Nevertheless, from the rate at which the disappearances have happened, possibly as many as five thousand Hai have vanished this way. The number may be less; some of those cases may be undiscovered murders, secret changes of identity, or defections to the Unfettered. We don't have the data to make an estimate for human disappearances."`
	"CN-13207" `	Teeneep explains, "The organization I lead has contacts with sympathetic individuals and organizations throughout Hai space. We have enough funding to hire a few hundred full-time employees of our own. Most of them are lawyers, social workers, or administrative employees. A few are investigative journalists or various types of researchers."`
	"CN-13208" `	"We've spent the last three years researching this problem, but it helped a lot to meet the people who have been rescued."`
	"CN-13209" `	A Hai near Teeneep responds. "Yes... and no. We work with police who investigate the disappearances, and sometimes they find the missing person.`
	"CN-13210" `	"Our biggest problem is a lack of help in human space. Local police are overwhelmed with crime in the regions where the kidnapping victims are found. Worse, the kidnappers leave behind virtually no evidence to investigate. Your navies and agencies haven't the time to help us; they're busy cleaning up after the war. The Syndicate has unfinished business they won't talk about.`
	"CN-13211" `	"Hai space is more manageable, but our resources are not infinite. The pattern just isn't clear enough yet for the Elders to justify more expenditure. They tell me that if we can prove the disappearances are part of a coordinated kidnapping effort, they'll put all the resources they can spare into stopping the crime. They also say their investigators have been unable to discover anything, but sometimes their responses don't add up. We presume this is because they're blocking our access to classified information."`
	"CN-13212" `	Teeneep nods. "We need a skilled and trustworthy pilot with the strength and connections to investigate locations we cannot easily access. Our mutual friend recommended you."`
	"CN-13213" `	Teeneep smiles and gestures for you to follow as she walks over to a desk where an elderly Hai is conversing with another, younger, Hai. "Wayou, sorry to interrupt you. Could you please show Captain <last> the symbol?"`
	"CN-13214" `	Wayou taps on the controls for a moment and brings up a symbol that looks like an angry cat in a circle. Teeneep asks, "Have you seen this before?"`
	"CN-13215" `	"Yes, I have."`
	"CN-13216" `	"No, I've never seen it before."`
	"CN-13217" `	Wayou nods. "This symbol has been found a number of times where rescued Hai have had cadmium poisoning, but we cannot identify its origin or meaning. This may be key to finding the kidnappers' identity and whereabouts."`
	"CN-13218" `	Teeneep smiles and gestures for you to follow as she walks over to a desk where an elderly Hai is in conversation with someone who you realize, to your surprise, is Gipeep. "Captain <last>! It's good to see you again. I still can't thank you enough," he enthuses.`
	"CN-13219" `	Teeneep smiles and cuts in to address the older Hai, "Wayou, sorry to interrupt you. Could you please show Captain <last> the symbol?"`
	"CN-13220" `	Wayou taps on the controls for a moment and brings up a symbol that looks like an angry cat in a circle. Teeneep asks, "Do you remember this?"`
	"CN-13221" `	"Yes, I do."`
	"CN-13222" `	"No, I don't remember this symbol."`
	"CN-13223" `	She nods. "This symbol was on the key to the crate Gipeep had been locked in. He swiped it and brought it back with you. It has been found a number of times in association with the circumstances where rescued Hai have had some level of cadmium poisoning. We have not been able to identify where it originates from. We must know and seek out who they are and where they are hiding, though I believe our mutual friend will be satisfied with merely the 'who' for now."`
	"CN-13224" `	She hands you a data card. "This has as many images of the symbol as we have, and information on where we've found it so far. Perhaps you might find it useful. Think about who you might be able to ask, and follow any leads. If you can find out where this symbol comes from or who uses it, return here, and we will pay you 2,000,000 credits."`
	"CN-13225" `	"I'll start right away."`
	"CN-13226" `	"No, I don't know if I'm willing to do that."`
	"CN-13227" `	Her eyes narrow at you. "Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure you won't help us?"`
	"CN-13228" `	You've had a lot of information to absorb in the last few minutes but with a moment of thought you realize that the entire crisis may depend upon you helping to find the source of this.`
	"CN-13229" `	"Yes, sorry, I'll start right away."`
	"CN-13230" `	"No, that's definitely in too deep for me."`
	"CN-13231" `	Teeneep's expression goes blank. Behind you, you hear the sound of a Pulse Rifle firing before everything goes dark.`
	"CN-13232" `	As you return to your ship you can't help but think you have no idea where you would find this information, but you are pretty sure you can ask Alondo for an idea of where to start.`
	"CN-13233" `You make what is beginning to feel like a standard request to land at the secure spaceport and disembark with relevant copies of files on a data stick in hand. It doesn't take long to track down Alondo, though you do have to wait nearly half an hour while he finishes a meeting with a Hai official. When he's done, Alondo waves you into the room and asks you to take a seat. The seat you choose is clearly designed to be comfortable for a Hai, making for a rather strange experience for a human.`
	"CN-13234" `	You show Alondo the cat symbol you found. He says, "There's a research institute on Earth that specializes in the history of politics during the early hyperspace travel era. If anyone would recognize this symbol, it's them. I'll pass it on and let you know what they say.`
	"CN-13235" `	"In the meantime, could you stop by some of the Hai worlds near the wormhole? They've obviously ramped up security on Allhome, but I'd like to have a pair of friendly eyes check it out. The Hai may be using this as a cover to put their military into a threatening position... not that I think they'd do that, but we've just been through one war. We have concerns, and I may be getting paranoid sitting here in the most Hai place that there is.`
	"CN-13236" `	"Plus," he pauses, visibly softening. "It'd be nice to know how they're handling things. It seems to have been quite a shock to them, and civilian populations don't always react well to suddenly heightened security. There's a lot of very high-level stuff going on, and I'd personally feel better if someone could tell me the regular people were handling things alright. No need to do anything special, just have a look around and see how things are going."`
	"CN-13237" `The peaceful spaceport is suddenly filled with the harsh sound of sirens. You spot some Hai and a small number of humans running to their ships and speeding quickly into orbit. It appears that the system is under attack, but this is behind the heightened security front in Allhome and the Unfettered Hai never reach this far south... A loud speaker begins blaring throughout the spaceport: "Unfettered humans have entered the system in a large fleet and have begun attacking! Requesting all combat-worthy pilots to assist in the defense of our space. These enemies of harmony are not welcome here."`
	"CN-13238" `	You find the phrase "unfettered humans" odd, but guess that they may be referring to pirates who have somehow slipped through. The Hai probably expect you help with your reputation, and this is certainly a significant threat to be attacking here.`
	"CN-13239" `	Your heart drops at the phrase "unfettered humans," as the last time you heard that was when the Unfettered Hai used that phrase to refer to the Alphas. If it is really the Alphas attacking the Hai, then it is probably a good idea to help.`
	"CN-13240" `The battle has ended, but the spaceport still seems more hectic than usual. Ships are jumping in from the surrounding systems to help any injured and to repair any damage that may have occurred. Despite the heightened security there is an air of concern and worry that seems to be exactly the thing Alondo was worried about.`
	"CN-13241" `	After some hours pass and the commotion has died down, a Hai in uniform approaches you. "We have heard from several people here that you are considered a seasoned fighter among your people and learned of your current status assisting our government on other matters. Would you lend your combat prowess to us to resolve this issue?"`
	"CN-13242" `	"I'd be glad to help. What can I do?"`
	"CN-13243" `	"What issue?"`
	"CN-13244" `	"I understand that you just helped to defend this system from human pirates. That is the issue that needs to be resolved.`
	"CN-13245" `	"Human attacks on our systems are very rare, but recently we have experienced an increased number of raids. I'm told you recently assisted in dealing with a much more successful one on Allhome. We captured a crew member of this most recent attack who was attempting to flee in an escape pod, and he gave us information that a gang that calls themselves 'Scar's Legion' has discovered our territory and is responsible for some of the recent raids.`
	"CN-13246" `	"Unfortunately, he would not tell us where this gang is, or who the leader is, so there is nothing we are able to do about it. Many humans who live peacefully among us told us that you might be capable of assistance, though."`
	"CN-13247" `	"I'll see what I can do."`
	"CN-13248" `	"You want me to hunt down Scar's Legion to stop them from attacking you?"`
	"CN-13249" `	"We understand that these humans are likely misguided. We ask that you resolve this peacefully if possible, but the loss of life from these continued attacks is unacceptable."`
	"CN-13250" `	"Sorry, but I'm not interested."`
	"CN-13251" `	"Thank you. Please return to <planet> after you have sought to resolve this situation."`
	"CN-13252" `You visit the Navy outpost on <origin> and ask the officers there if they have any information on Scar's Legion. After running a background check on you to make sure you're not up to no good, and sheepishly apologizing once they recognize you, an officer hands you a copy of a folder containing all the information that the Navy has on the gang. "Nothing in here is classified, so you're free to keep it," the officer says.`
	"CN-13253" `	You return to your ship and sift through the files. The leader of the gang is named Scar (to no one's surprise), who used to be an important member of another pirate gang before forming his own. The Navy estimates their numbers to be in the low thousands, mostly responsible for petty crime in the Far North and not a cause of too much trouble, but the files all date back to a number of years ago. Clearly something has changed in the time since these files were last updated if Scar's Legion is now powerful enough to even attempt to attack the Hai.`
	"CN-13254" `You wander the <origin> spaceport on the lookout for anyone who might have any information on the whereabouts of Scar's Legion. A self-described fixer promises you information in exchange for payment, but after handing her the few credits that she's asking for, she runs off with her gun in her hands to discourage you from following. Perhaps someone on another nearby pirate planet will have actual information for you.`
	"CN-13255" `You order a drink from a small rundown bar in the <origin> spaceport and try to make small talk with the bartender to get him open to giving information about Scar's Legion. He seems reluctant at first, but eventually warms up to you. A few other patrons of the bar join in on the conversation. Luckily no one seems mad about you asking about Scar's Legion. One of the patrons makes it clear that Scar's Legion has no friends on this world, or "at least not anymore."`
	"CN-13256" `	You leave the bar after an hour or two. Once you return to your ship, you write down all the information you can remember. The gang used to operate exclusively out of the Far North until they crossed one of the larger gangs, causing them to flee the region a few years ago. One of the pirates guessed that they fled for the Core.`
	"CN-13257" `	Another person mentioned that the leader of the gang used to always talk about making their own base in an uninhabited system where no one would find it. "He always talked about hollowing out an asteroid to use as a hideout. My guess is he was just always high on the ringworld shavings his gang was dealing."`
	"CN-13258" `It doesn't take long for you to find someone who knows something about Scar's Legion. You meet someone who says he'll give you information "free of charge."`
	"CN-13259" `	"Scar's Legion have been a thorn in my side for months now. Wrecked my ship a while back, and have been causing me trouble ever since. If you're planning on taking them out, then I'll tell you everything you need to know."`
	"CN-13260" `	The pirate tells you that he doesn't know where the base of Scar's Legion is, but he mentions that they spend a lot of time in the uninhabited systems of the Far North. "Nothing out there but cold rocks and gas giants, but if they're spending so much time out there then they must have set up a base of some sort on one of those frozen planets."`
	"CN-13261" `After having visited various pirate worlds asking about Scar's Legion, you believe that you know where their hideout is.`
	"CN-13262" `	You know that the leader of Scar's Legion used to talk about wanting a hollowed out asteroid as a base. You also know that Scar's Legion has recently been very active in the uninhabited systems of the Far North. You conclude that the gang's hideout is likely an asteroid located in one of a few systems that are in proximity to the wormhole that leads to the Hai. You mark <waypoints> on your map and get ready to confront them.`
	"CN-13263" `You've located the Scar's Hideout, a massive asteroid in orbit around a gas giant. As you fly over the asteroid's surface, you spot an open blast door. They must be inviting you inside. It surprises you that a gang of pirates would be capable of creating such a base, as the materials and time needed to make something like this are immense.`
	"CN-13264" `	Upon entering the blast door, it closes behind you, leaving you in complete dark. Suddenly, floodlights flash on all around your ship. The brightness of the lights prevents you from seeing anyone beyond them, but you suspect that there are a number of weapons pointed at your ship right now.`
	"CN-13265" `	"Who are you and what do you want?" a voice booms from a loud speaker. You press a button to activate your ship's external speakers.`
	"CN-13266" `	"I'm <first> <last>, here to negotiate on behalf of the Hai."`
	"CN-13267" `	"I'm <first> <last>, here to take this gang down."`
	"CN-13268" `	The voice laughs. "Well too bad, because you're right in the middle of a hornet's nest. Fire, boys!"`
	"CN-13269" `	The voice laughs. "Ah, yes. Those squirrels. I take it they've had enough of us plundering their systems. Boys!"`
	"CN-13270" `	The floodlights turn off, revealing a large room with what must be hundreds of pirates with guns of various sizes trained on your ship. One wrong move and you're toast. "Please, Captain. Step out of your ship."`
	"CN-13271" `	(Comply with the orders.)`
	"CN-13272" `	(Attempt to escape.)`
	"CN-13273" `	You activate your ship's engines to escape. The floodlights suddenly reactivate.`
	"CN-13274" `	Before you can even react, several dozen lasers and streams of bullets come flying out from behind the floodlights. You attempt to pull your ship up and fly straight through the ceiling before your ship is too damaged to move, but then you spot a number of rockets flying straight at your cockpit. You die instantly as the rockets impact the glass in front of you.`
	"CN-13275" `	You step out of your ship, and a tall man with a scar across his cheek steps forward from the crowd of pirates. Presumably, it's the eponymous leader of the gang.`
	"CN-13276" `	"The Hai ask that you stop attacking their systems."`
	"CN-13277" `	"You must be Scar."`
	"CN-13278" `	"No. Scar is long dead," the leader says.`
	"CN-13279" `	"Oh, so does that make you Scab?"`
	"CN-13280" `	The leader grimaces. "I'll cut your tongue out if you don't watch your mouth."`
	"CN-13281" `	You take a step back. "The Hai ask that you stop attacking their systems," you say, attempting not to get shanked.`
	"CN-13282" `	"Perhaps we will stop," the leader says with a smile. "Under one condition. We'd like a one time shipment of various Hai weapons and technology. The shipment should be as big as possible. I've seen the freighters those aliens have. They're massive. Load two or three up with the goods and we'll consider focusing our attention elsewhere."`
	"CN-13283" `	"Okay. I'll meet with the Hai and see what they can provide."`
	"CN-13284" `	"I'm afraid that I can't allow that."`
	"CN-13285" `	The crowd of pirates respond with a cacophony of jeers and boos. The leader raises his fist in the air, and the crowd falls silent. "Well I'm afraid that just won't do."`
	"CN-13286" `	The leader paces back and forth in silence for a moment. "Well if we don't get what we want, then we're just going to need to keep on attacking. Which means that your presence here is pretty useless."`
	"CN-13287" `	The leader turns to the crowd. "How about a fight? To the death!" The crowd erupts in cheers. The leader turns back to you. "We fight in this system only. Just you and me. You attempt to run, my men hunt you down. How's that sound?" You attempt to respond, but before you can, the leader pulls his gun and aims it at you. "Run."`
	"CN-13288" `	"Excellent!" the pirate says, which is met with cheers from the rest of the pirates in the room. "But make it quick. Wouldn't want to keep us waiting." The blast doors reopen, and you return to your ship to leave immediately.`
	"CN-13289" `Upon landing on <origin>, the authorities at the secure spaceport give you <payment> for your assistance in defending their systems and for helping to track down the culprits. They also direct you to an emergency session of the Council of Elders, the now increasingly familiar elected ruling body of the Hai, to tell them about Scar's Legion. Unlike last time there is almost no wait, and the Elders are very direct. The very first one of them to address you says, "Please, tell us what has occurred."`
	"CN-13290" `	"They asked that you load three large freighters with various weapons and technology to give to them. Only then will they stop attacking you."`
	"CN-13291" `	"A simple request," the elders says. "Little more than what the Unfettered ask of us. We shall load three Geocoris immediately."`
	"CN-13292" `	"Who is to say that they will not use our own weapons against us?" another elder chimes in. "This deal could only hurt us."`
	"CN-13293" `	"There's no guarantee that they will not attack again, but they promised that they would focus elsewhere."`
	"CN-13294" `	"I could return to them and defeat them if you desire."`
	"CN-13295" `	"No," says the elder. "We are not interested in condemning these humans to death if all they ask is for technology."`
	"CN-13296" `	"I believe a bigger issue here is how this will impact our human friends beyond the wormhole," an elder says. "If these pirates are not attacking us, then who will they be attacking? Will we not simply become weapons dealers for a far off war?"`
	"CN-13297" `	"We will inform the Republic Ambassador that we are providing these pirates with our technology for our own sake. They have been capable of combating our technology in the past. I am sure that they will be able to handle it now. Please, <first>, escort the freighters to these pirates so that they may leave us alone."`
	"CN-13298" `	"I defeated the leader of Scar's Legion. They shouldn't cause any more trouble for you now."`
	"CN-13299" `	One of the elders frowns. "Did you kill their leader in cold blood, or was it self defense?"`
	"CN-13300" `	"They asked for a tribute of your weapons and technology, but I refused the offer, so they attacked me."`
	"CN-13301" `	"They were not willing to negotiate, and I was forced to defend myself."`
	"CN-13302" `	"This is most unfortunate," another elder says. "But I am happy to hear that they will not cause any more loss of life among our people."`
	"CN-13303" `	"This is most unfortunate," another elder says. "We would have been willing to provide them the technology they sought if only they had asked nicely in the first place."`
	"CN-13304" `	"Better that we eliminate a threat instead of making them stronger through becoming their weapons dealer," the first elder says. "These pirates might have attacked us with our own technology, or, worse still, attacked other humans with them, making us complicit in their slaughter."`
	"CN-13305" `	The elders thank you for your assistance in this situation and send you on your way.`
	"CN-13306" `Teeneep is waiting for you when you return to her base on Darkwaste, though notably the security point at the front is properly manned this time. Perhaps the most recent raid has given them cause for concern. There is a quiet corner of the living area that is unoccupied at the time, and she gestures for you to join her there.`
	"CN-13307" `	"So," she says, "please, tell me everything about this recent experience. I must know what happened and what the Elders chose to do."`
	"CN-13308" `	You briefly relay the initial events, starting with the raid, then the request for your assistance, the search that you went on, and the eventual discovery of Scar's Legion and their secret base in Danoa where they issued their demands.`
	"CN-13309" `	"The Elders were glad they were dealt with, but some would have handed over your technology to appease them."`
	"CN-13310" `	"The Elders would have handed them Hai tech, but I could not allow them to use it to terrorize other humans."`
	"CN-13311" `	Teeneep's eyebrows shoot up but she restrains herself at the tone of your response. "Indeed, it would not be wise to enable more of your people to suffer their predations. I must be clear on something though; the Elders, you said they'd have given them what they wanted? They said that? They explicitly said they'd have rather dealt arms to human pirates than eliminate a threat?"`
	"CN-13312" `	"Yes, they were very focused on a peaceful solution and felt the outcome was unfortunate."`
	"CN-13313" `	"Actually, they said they'd have handed it over if they'd only asked nicely."`
	"CN-13314" `	Teeneep's eyebrows shoot up in an extremely human-like expression. "They said that? They explicitly said they'd have rather dealt arms to human pirates than eliminate a threat?"`
	"CN-13315" `	"Yes, they said it was most unfortunate."`
	"CN-13316" `	"Scar's Legion wanted Hai tech. The Elders have handed over your technology to appease them."`
	"CN-13317" `	"Scar's Legion wanted Hai tech. Some Elders argued against dealing arms, but they handed them over anyway."`
	"CN-13318" `	When you mention the Elders who argued against dealing arms, she nods as if expecting to be satisfied, but the rest of the sentence seems to take a brief moment to register. When you finish, her face flashes through a range of expressions too quickly for you to follow.`
	"CN-13319" `	"WHAT!?"`
	"CN-13320" `	Teeneep's exclamation is loud enough that every head in the room turns towards you both. "The Elders would prioritize our secrecy over our safety, even when the purpose of the secrecy is to maintain our safety?!"`
	"CN-13321" `	"Clearly many of the Elders have become weak and misguided, lost in the miasma of our current difficulties. I must speak to our mutual friend and investigate this. No Hai should be accepting of this subversion of our society's critical values.`
	"CN-13322" `	"Scar's Legion wanted Hai tech, but I could not allow them to use it to terrorize other humans."`
	"CN-13323" `	"The Elders seemed intent on a peaceful solution, but I do not believe that was truly possible."`
	"CN-13324" `	She nods seriously, "Indeed, I would expect that a serious threat capable of slipping the current heightened security and raiding our worlds should not be expected to actually engage in peace, nor trusted to do so. You say the Elders wanted a peaceful solution though, yet it sounds like that did not happen. Did you destroy them?"`
	"CN-13325" `	"I defeated their leader."`
	"CN-13326" `	"I destroyed their ships."`
	"CN-13327" `	"Ah, so bloodied, but perhaps not gone," she muses.`
	"CN-13328" `	"Even with the ships you destroyed, there will doubtless be remnants of the group left. We shall have to do some investigation of our own in Danoa." She narrows her eyes at you suddenly. "You did not tell the Elders everything you have told me, did you? What did you tell them?"`
	"CN-13329" `	Teeneep seems to have an incredibly perceptive sense of both humans and their use of language to have picked up on this.`
	"CN-13330" `	"I told them Scar's Legion was not willing to negotiate, and I was forced to defend myself."`
	"CN-13331" `	"I simply did not mention the terms which I found unacceptable, and said I was forced to defend myself."`
	"CN-13332" `	She cocks her head and looks at you searchingly for a moment, but doesn't seem to reach any particular conclusion.`
	"CN-13333" `	"Yes, well, I suppose you would have to defend yourself in any situation where you didn't give them what they wanted," she says. "In any event, this raises some serious questions about what exactly is going on in those chambers where they make their decisions.`
	"CN-13334" `	"You must take me to <planet> immediately. This is something I should investigate personally if I hope to find the truth of things, but I cannot land my own ship there right now because of... bureaucratic reasons. My people here can analyze any sensor logs or other data you have on Scar's Legion. You've found solid proof of the Elders arming pirates, though I doubt this is a lead on the kidnappings. At <planet>, I will catch up with our mutual friend from the secure spaceport. I have sufficient privileges to be there, even if I have no clearance for landing my ship."`
	"CN-13335" `	She waves over Wayou towards you. "Please, give Wayou any relevant data files while I pack for departure. I suspect that I have kept you away from <planet> far too long as it is. According to my sources, people there await your return."`
	"CN-13336" `	You've barely had time to load your logs onto a data stick and hand them to Wayou before Teeneep is packed and waiting to depart. It would seem your course is set.`
	"CN-13337" `As soon as you disembark Teeneep slips off through an entirely different security checkpoint. She definitely shows them some sort of ID but you're some distance away by that point. A quick inquiry confirms that Alondo is actually around this time and you send him a message to alert him that you're heading his way.`
	"CN-13338" `	As you approach the office where Alondo seems to have been set up for the time being you can hear voices through the open door and you slow to a stop as you realize they sound agitated. "Look, Gruyere, you can't expect me to not organize some things around you when you're off being busy elsewhere. Regardless of whether it was your idea."`
	"CN-13339" `	You clearly identify Alondo when he responds, "I wouldn't blame you if you'd at least tried to contact me, or left a message, but it's just typical of how you operate."`
	"CN-13340" `	"You were eleven hours out of sync across timezones, it was four in the morning where you were, and you know damn well we've all been more than busy enough to let a message slip here or there. Especially since Terry is now on Mountaintop and I am absent any assistance."`
	"CN-13341" `	(Come back after his call is complete.)`
	"CN-13342" `	(Listen in on the conversation.)`
	"CN-13343" `	"Sam, it's done, it's fine, the things that need to be happening are happening. I don't care, just stop expecting me to thank you for it. I'm not doing this again," says Alondo, exasperated.`
	"CN-13344" `	The man you now recognize as Remington pauses for a moment before speaking in a low tone. "Are you going to hold that one against me forever, Gru?"`
	"CN-13345" `	"Don't call me Gru."`
	"CN-13346" `	A protracted silence ensues.`
	"CN-13347" `	You almost expect the silence to be broken by a cough, but instead you hear the sound of a datapad being firmly set to one side. "Anyway, Captain <last> will be here momentarily. Why don't you see if they're on their way?"`
	"CN-13348" `	You hear someone, presumably Remington, stand up and you quickly backpedal a few steps before resuming a nonchalant walk towards the office just as Remington steps out to look for you.`
	"CN-13349" `	(Make my appearance.)`
	"CN-13350" `	You wander off for a few minutes, giving Alondo his privacy. Upon your return, you are face to face with Remington who has stood up to greet you.`
	"CN-13351" `	"Ah, <last>, please come in." Remington moves over and clears your path to the nearest seat.`
	"CN-13352" `	"It's good to see you back again, <last>," says Alondo, "and just in time for something that I think it's best to ask you to do. Would you like to tell the good Captain what the plan is, Remington?"`
	"CN-13353" `	The slightly accentuated formality on 'Remington' is not lost on you, but the Syndicate PR man doesn't react to it as he hands you a datapad displaying a hyperspace relay. "Since this crisis began, the Navy maintained hyperspace relays in Rajak and Hasseleh, linking our communication network to the Hai's through a secure portal. However, while this has allowed us to communicate to anywhere back home, it has some disadvantages. What you see there is the solution.`
	"CN-13354" `	"There are fourteen relays between the wormhole and Earth, but that means routing through Elnath or Aldebaran. Lovelace Labs owns those relays, and they get priority access, so our bandwidth is poor there. During a backlog, information will be routed through even more indirect routes, which is holding up Syndicate business by problematic degrees."`
	"CN-13355" `	"And you want me to place some new relays?"`
	"CN-13356" `	"Can't you just change the priorities of the Lovelace Labs relays?"`
	"CN-13357" `	"What if you distribute the traffic over multiple routes?"`
	"CN-13358" `	"So why haven't you placed more relays?"`
	"CN-13359" `	Remington says, "They're privately-owned relays, so we have no say over them. Lovelace Labs reserves priority status on that bandwidth for their internal purposes. We pay a stiff sum to get the highest priority they are willing to part with, but often they don't leave much for anyone else."`
	"CN-13360" `	"And you want me to place some more relays?"`
	"CN-13361" `	Remington says, "That's how the hyperspace relay system already works, but if part of a transmission passes through a long route, the whole transmission is delayed. You get choppy and degraded video, sound problems, and the like. None of the routes are great."`
	"CN-13362" `	"As I said before, there are fourteen relays between the wormhole and Earth, which is theoretically the same number as there are to Markab, but for us that means routing through Elnath or Aldebaran. Those two relays are owned and maintained by Lovelace Labs, who ferry an enormous volume of data back and forth between those two systems. This means that communications back to the Syndicate tend to either get held up in a buffer waiting on priority data streams that Lovelace reserves for itself, or it gets routed for eighteen links through Sirius, or seventeen through Sol itself. Both of these systems have strained infrastructure with high throughput latencies as it is, even for priority communications. So while Xilin has the highest priority access and the shortest distance and Alondo here has all his comms routing a whole different way entirely, the Syndicate is getting many of our comms held up to sometimes problematic degrees."`
	"CN-13363" `	Remington makes an unimpressed face. "We have. They keep getting blown up by marauders."`
	"CN-13364" `	"I thought even pirates wouldn't blow up relays?"`
	"CN-13365" `	"Why would they be doing that, don't they use them too?"`
	"CN-13366" `	Remington nods. "Yes, well, this end of space has never had relays since nobody needed them. For a long time the marauders here have been using the communications darkness out this way to do their business with impunity. The sole advantage of these relays is that ships out this way can call for help when they couldn't before. So the relays the Syndicate have been putting up have been getting destroyed, along with several of our security ships.`
	"CN-13367" `	"This one that you see in front of you is different, though." He makes eye contact with Alondo and very deliberately emphases the word as he continues, "WE have been working with the Hai to make relays that look human-made, but utilize advanced Hai technology to baffle scanners attempting to find them. They'll form communication links the marauders can't destroy."`
	"CN-13368" `	He looks at you, "But of course, since they have Hai tech in them, they need to be delivered by a trustworthy human who's not likely to get blown up by a marauder."`
	"CN-13369" `	"I can deploy the relays for you."`
	"CN-13370" `	"Not sure I want to do this."`
	"CN-13371" `	Alondo looks at you and says, "We need you to do this. It'll be very helpful."`
	"CN-13372" `	The emphasis he places on the words 'you' and 'helpful' suddenly give you the sense that this might be coordinated specifically for your benefit. Realizing this, you nod and accept it, on his account.`
	"CN-13373" `	"Excellent," says Remington, standing up and flicking over the pickup details to your pad. "Check in with Terry on your way; she may have updated scouting information. Now I have another meeting to get to momentarily, but thank you, Captain. It's been a pleasure seeing you again."`
	"CN-13374" `	He gives a meaningful look to Alondo on his way out, but exactly what it means is not clear to you. Alondo's posture relaxes as he gets up and quietly closes the door.`
	"CN-13375" `	"Now," says Alondo, setting aside his pad. "We have some other business. I have a lead on this symbol you wanted investigating. I still wish you'd tell me why you're looking for it, but for now, I'll accept that it's important." He fishes around in a small satchel bag that usually carries his pad and pulls out an actual piece of physical paper. The text on it reads, "Adjunct Research Library, Navy Intelligence Observatory, Moscow. Room number: 3017A19."`
	"CN-13376" `	"Fortunately, I found someone for you to speak to and a cover for being there in the first place. Xilin needs a trusted aide to stay on top of things here, especially as Mountaintop progresses. So far he's found the staff provided there to be... lacking. I get the sense from him that he's expecting things to get more complicated, though he hasn't said in so many words. So, you get to go to Earth to pick up his assistant, and while you're there, you can speak to a certain Ms. Giti Gilani. She's an expert in the history of space flight and related archaic topics. Meanwhile the aide you'll pick up is a young man called Batu Cegeen. You'll have to land at the Ulaanbaatar spaceport for him, and travel locally for your business with Ms. Gilani."`
	"CN-13377" `	"Do I need to speak to Xilin myself?"`
	"CN-13378" `	Alondo shakes his head. "No, I have already told him about the plan to have you drop off some relays, and explained that it's just a minor detour to ask you to go on a bit further. It saves them having to try and arrange suitably secure transport all the way from Earth to <origin> and then back to <planet>. This way the worst he'll have to deal with is the one trip from here back to wormhole later, which is easy enough."`
	"CN-13379" `	Alondo leans forward on his desk. "And <last>, I don't know what's going on, but if you won't even tell me, it must be dangerous. Please, be careful."`
	"CN-13380" `Stopping in to <origin>, it takes practically no time to find Terry. She seems to be in motion at almost all times, trailed by a plethora of people constantly bringing things to her attention and then scurrying away once they've received whatever answer they were seeking. Between seeing her and crossing the eighty or so meters to come face to face, you see her put her thumbprint to at least three separate datapads; presumably approvals of some sort.`
	"CN-13381" `	"Ah, <last>. Excellent," she says as you arrive. "Come with me."`
	"CN-13382" `	The main concourse of this station is set up for a movie production, littered with small meeting rooms squeezed between significant operations. They'd probably be storage cupboards on a normal station, but everything and everyone on this station seems to be occupied. A diligent attendant blocks the door as she closes it behind you, and you see the queue of people scatter through the door's window. No doubt they'd return as soon as Terry was available again.`
	"CN-13383" `	"David Cohen is an eccentric character, but things are progressing rapidly and smoothly so far. The station is working, and the cover is gaining traction. From what I hear they're even making the movie now. They've almost made enough progress that people could believe the movie has been in production long enough to justify all this."`
	"CN-13384" `	"You certainly seem busy."`
	"CN-13385" `	"Looks like it's thanks to you."`
	"CN-13386" `	She momentarily adopts a self-satisfied smile.`
	"CN-13387" `	"Yes, well, this poses a few issues of its own with the increased demand on the relay bandwidth from here, but I wouldn't have my regular job if something like this was too much to stay on top of."`
	"CN-13388" `	"Your regular job?"`
	"CN-13389" `	"Your job as a secretary?"`
	"CN-13390" `	She rolls her eyes and shakes her head with a little huff. "It's ridiculous that Sam tried to make me look like some common witless secretary. No, I mean the job I had right before the end of the war, and the job I still seem to be doing seventy percent of even while I'm here."`
	"CN-13391" `	"Yes, my regular job. Specifically the one I had before the end of the war, and before this farce they have me doing now, while my successor tries and fails to be half as competent."`
	"CN-13392" `	She pushes a button her datapad's case and it ejects a business card which she hands to you. You see on the card, "Chief Operations Officer."`
	"CN-13393" `	"Of course," she says, taking the card back and neatly pushing into the case, "I'm not allowed to disseminate those cards at the moment. At least not until this is over, when I can take back my position after the fool in my place has made a mess of things."`
	"CN-13394" `	She seems absolutely sure that that's exactly how things are going to turn out.`
	"CN-13395" `	"Now, speaking of my second job, you have relays on your ship that will make that easier, yes?"`
	"CN-13396" `	"Yes, I have the relays."`
	"CN-13397" `	"Wonderful, the latency has been killing me lately. These are the coordinates for deployment." She flicks the relevant data files from her pad to you. "Make sure those are loaded into the relays. Deploy them roughly in the right place, and they'll move to their own positions."`
	"CN-13398" `	She checks something on her pad and then stands up. "Now, come with me. I need to introduce you to someone in case you need each other and I'm busy."`
	"CN-13399" `	With astonishing speed she strides down the concourse, clearing a path between all manner of employees and visitors. This clear path perhaps being the only reason you are able to keep up. She calls out to a human dressed in a business suit who turns with evident surprise, sees you both, and approaches.`
	"CN-13400" `	"I'm the one who should be using formal titles to address you, so please, Captain, don't call me sir."`
	"CN-13401" `	"A personality as big as yourself should be receiving praise and recognition wherever you go! People must really have no respect these days."`
	"CN-13402" `	"No need to downplay yourself, Captain! You've done God's work in saving humanity from that alien scourge."`
	"CN-13403" `	Terry looks between you. "Captain <last> is doing a lot to help us out, so please make yourselves acquainted. Don't be too long though, the Captain has a job to do." With that, she gives the both of you a parting nod and strides back into the chaos. Almost immediately a swarm of people with datapads materialize from nowhere and pursue her.`
	"CN-13404" `	The man grins and shakes his head as she departs. "Remarkable woman. Anyway, the name's David Joseph Turner, venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and famous Paradise Worlds businessman." Turner grabs a business card from his pocket and hands it to you. It contains his contact information, an address on Martini, and boasts in golden letters his net worth of more than three billion credits.`
	"CN-13405" `	"You may not have heard of me, but I've sure as hell heard of you." Turner turns around and waves his arm across the crowd of people working on the station concourse. "To be involved in funding and producing this movie, though, what an adventure. You know I've paid for movies to be made, or at least invested in them, but I've never actually been there while it was happening. Quite remarkable."`
	"CN-13406" `	"Of course, there are the communication latency issues, and the dreadful matter of the black spot that is the route through Cardax. We need proper coverage of that area if we're going to provide security to the tourists who seem intent on coming here. Though I hear that you might be working on that as we speak, am I right?"`
	"CN-13407" `	"Yes, I'll fix it."`
	"CN-13408" `	"It's on my way."`
	"CN-13409" `	Turner smiles with a little twinkle in his eye.`
	"CN-13410" `	"Of course, the famous Captain <last> always has a finger on the pulse. Being right where they need to be. Good thing we got the advertising out there up in time, hey?" He taps his nose and gives a shockingly conspicuous wink.`
	"CN-13411" `	"Anyway, give me your details too just in case I need them, and I'll let you get to your business. Good luck out there." He checks your details into his pad and gives you a firm handshake before hurrying off towards people moving a very large prop. "No, no, they said they wanted that on stage five! Stage five!"`
	"CN-13412" `	Time to drop off those relays and head to <planet>.`
	"CN-13413" `You land at Ulaanbaatar's spaceport and receive a message that Batu has to finalize some arrangements and will arrive in the evening. That leaves plenty of time for you to see to your other business about the symbol.`
	"CN-13414" `	At an information desk, you inquire about the route to Moscow and are given two options. You can take a very expensive private taxi service, which you could bill to Alondo, or you can take the long route and see the sights. Either way, you'll have plenty of time before Batu arrives.`
	"CN-13415" `	The attendant at the information desk asks you, "Would you like to contact the direct taxi service, or take the slow route and see the sights?"`
	"CN-13416" `	"I'm in a hurry. I should take the direct route."`
	"CN-13417" `	"The slow route sounds more scenic. I'll try that."`
	"CN-13418" `	Moscow is thousands of kilometers away, so you travel most of the route on shuttlecraft. It seems some new pilots took an option you never considered: planet-side travel in an exclusive contract with local transit authorities who pay half the mortgage. Certainly a safe career, but it would be too dull to be restrained to just one planet.`
	"CN-13419" `	You fly past mountain ranges and lakes, and over bare tundras and steppes. The gray cities of Earth stand out when you pass them; packed in their ancient locations and their new ones. Even from far above, the cities' vast megabuildings are an imposing sight. There's still some farmland on this route, even now that farming has largely moved off-world, but not enough for the twenty billion people living on Earth.`
	"CN-13420" `	After three shuttle trips, you land in the city of Nizhny and board a two-story train that hovers in a tunnel of superconducting magnets. Such a complex system would be unprofitable anywhere else in human space, but the population is so high here that these village-sized trains run non-stop at full capacity. You must look lost as you disembark in the vast station in Moscow, and a passerby asks if you need directions.`
	"CN-13421" `	"How do I get to the surface?"`
	"CN-13422" `	"I'm looking for this address."`
	"CN-13423" `	You follow his directions and, while strolling through Moscow to your destination, pass many historic sites. An unmistakable sight catches your eye: the Museum of Cosmonautics, one of the largest museums of spaceflight on Earth. It is most famous for having the first hyperspace-capable human-made ship on display, painstakingly preserved for hundreds of years. The museum extends into the three megabuildings surrounding it, containing all manner of spaceflight firsts.`
	"CN-13424" `	At length you arrive at the building you seek and pass through its main doors into a room as big as a football field, filled with in-building trains, moving walkways, and hover-platform elevators. It's amazing how large Earth's megabuildings have become; some planets have smaller populations than the building you are standing in right now, and it is but one of hundreds you've seen on your short journey.`
	"CN-13425" `	You find an information desk, and inquire about the meaning of 'room number: 3017A19' - the 301st floor, section 7A, room 19 - and get directions. They point you to what looks like a cross between a train and an elevator. A robotic voice asks your destination.`
	"CN-13426" `	"Please take me to the 301st floor, section 7A, room 19."`
	"CN-13427" `	"Room 3017A19, please."`
	"CN-13428" `	Reaching the room in question you knock on the door which has a nameplate that reads, 'Giti Gilani' with the title 'Research Librarian' in small print underneath. You are swiftly greeted by a short, energetic looking lady. She looks you up and down and nods. "Captain <last>, you're not as tall as I thought you'd be in person. Please, please come in."`
	"CN-13429" `	You're ushered into a luxury taxi, complete with a built-in bar and the latest forms of entertainment. The taxi enters a ballistic trajectory into space and back down into the atmosphere, reaching your destination in under an hour. It links its aft exit port to a hover vehicle access port about half the way up the side of the building. The well-dressed driver leads you into the building and, after briefly consulting a directory, escorts you to your destination.`
	"CN-13430" `	"Floor 301, section 7A, room 19, sir," he says. "This is the office of research librarian Giti Giliani."`
	"CN-13431" `	"Thank you for the smooth trip."`
	"CN-13432" `	The friendly taxi driver bows slightly and returns to his taxi. As he leaves, you knock on the door.`
	"CN-13433" `	The door opens and you are swiftly greeted by a short, energetic looking lady. She looks you up and down and nods. "Captain <last>, you're not as tall as I thought you'd be in person. Please, please come in."`
	"CN-13434" `	Clearly someone took the liberty of informing Giti of at least the basic information about what was being searched for, and that it was you doing so. Once the door is shut and locked, though, it becomes clear she is quite excited about this search. She gestures to a seat near her work desk and briefly tidies some of the more egregiously scattered research items. "Would you like a drink? Tea, coffee, vodka? I already have some notes on the cat symbol but I need to discuss some things with you. Do you have any more images?"`
	"CN-13435" `	"Tea please."`
	"CN-13436" `	"Coffee would be good."`
	"CN-13437" `	"Uh, vodka?"`
	"CN-13438" `	"I'm fine thanks."`
	"CN-13439" `	"I do have some other pictures here with me."`
	"CN-13440" `	She acknowledges your selection and then pours herself a coffee from the pot with a quarter shot of vodka added in. "Gives it some kick," she says with a wink. "And did you have other pictures?"`
	"CN-13441" `	When you indicate that you do she beams and flounces into her seat with a flourish.`
	"CN-13442" `	"Oh excellent," she says, quickly pouring herself a coffee from the pot and practically skipping over to take her seat.`
	"CN-13443" `	"Well, you'll probably be disappointed with what I have so far," she begins, "but I'll start with what I have found and then you can show me any new pictures you have and we can see what I can do." She waits for you to indicate your understanding before she continues.`
	"CN-13444" `	"This cat symbol was used a century ago by a clandestine organization called 'Base Principles' that worked within the Syndicate."`
	"CN-13445" `	"Who were 'Base Principles?'"`
	"CN-13446" `	"Wait. What were they doing in the Syndicate?"`
	"CN-13447" `	She explains, "Base Principles were anarcho-syndicalists infiltrating the Syndicate from within, gaining clout through research findings gleaned from alien equipment, but nobody knows where they got it. The organization was eventually torn in two by regular anarchists and other unsavory characters looking to profit off the backdoor access to the Syndicate; this group kidnapped researchers from other institutes to expand their capabilities.`
	"CN-13448" `	"These others didn't cover their tracks well enough; the trail led back to the syndicalists that started it all in the first place, and Syndicate Internal Affairs quickly put a stop to the organization with extreme prejudice. Most of the anarchist leaders were killed in battle or executed after capture, but the internal players simply... disappeared.`
	"CN-13449" `	"Officially, the Syndicate maintains that they wiped Base Principles out to the last individual, but evidence never proved it had been conclusively terminated."`
	"CN-13450" `	"That's it?"`
	"CN-13451" `	"Was there anything else?"`
	"CN-13452" `	"Yes. That was over a century ago, but only a few decades back the same symbol came up again in conjunction with a smuggling ring that was kidnapping gifted children. It seems that a minor error resulted in a crate being misplaced by the smugglers, complete with a child inside and the symbol surreptitiously stamped on the corner plate. The ship the crate was meant to be on self-destructed when it was caught, and any potential affiliates went to ground. A handful of ships and individuals were identified retrospectively to have been involved, but none of them were ever seen again. The kidnappings stopped."`
	"CN-13453" `	She frowns at you. "No. Somewhat more recently, only a few decades back in fact, the same symbol came up again in conjunction with a smuggling ring that was kidnapping gifted children. It seems that a minor error resulted in a crate being misplaced by the smugglers, complete with a child inside and the symbol surreptitiously stamped on the corner plate. The ship the crate was meant to be on self-destructed when it was caught, and any potential affiliates went to ground. A handful of ships and individuals were identified retrospectively to have been involved, but none of them were ever seen again. The kidnappings stopped."`
	"CN-13454" `	She waves a hand dismissively at her screen. "Of course, I only received the one image to refer to, and the older records are not necessarily very good quality or captured with future research librarians in mind. So, please, show me what else you have."`
	"CN-13455" `	"I have some pictures to show you."`
	"CN-13456" `	"Can you glean more from this?"`
	"CN-13457" `	You pull out your datapad and hand it to her with the folder of relevant pictures, some carefully redacted of Hai paraphernalia, for her to look at. As she begins flicking through them she makes some comments.`
	"CN-13458" `	"You know, there's quite a lot more of these than I expected. All quite recent too, judging by the file quality and that crate design. They are exactly the same as the original. Someone clearly has made a deliberate decision to reuse the exact symbol, with no re-imagining or stylistic alterations whatsoever. If you ask me, that sounds like a group that has set itself to having the same goals, which means the Syndicate would probably be very interested in this. Though I suppose you'd have the connections there if... Oh!" She pauses. "Now this is interesting."`
	"CN-13459" `	She turns the datapad to you and shows you what looks like an amulet or maybe a jewelry charm. The scale in the image isn't very clear. "Do you see this patterning around the outside of the symbol on this? I'm quite sure nearly everyone in the galaxy would simply pass that off as decorative, but it's not." She pauses for a moment, perhaps expecting a response.`
	"CN-13460" `	(Politely wait for her to finish.)`
	"CN-13461" `	"I have a hunch you're going to tell me it's a form of writing."`
	"CN-13462" `	She looks impressed and says, "Very good! I underestimated you, Captain <last>.`
	"CN-13463" `	After a couple seconds, Giti looks slightly disappointed but makes no comment on the matter.`
	"CN-13464" `	"This is an archaic written shorthand notation used for ship's logs, back when they were considering data storage requirements for the thousands of people on board the slow ships they sent to Alpha Centauri. You'd be amazed how much space just logs and diaries can take up when the journey takes as long as theirs did." She smiles at you, "As it happens I wrote my Ph.D. thesis about that notation! Now I finally need that information for something other than getting a degree!"`
	"CN-13465" `	She frowns at it for a long moment, "There's quite a lot of notation here actually and... well, gosh, it's been twenty-eight years since I did that thesis. I can't just translate this on the fly. It'll take me some time to dig up my resources and work on it. Am I allowed to keep these pictures?"`
	"CN-13466" `	"Absolutely, I'll send you the folder."`
	"CN-13467" `	"Yes, and I can also give you some other data too."`
	"CN-13468" `	"Excellent, look, leave it with me and give me your contact info. I'll see if I can work out whether there's anything meaningful there and let you know."`
	"CN-13469" `	You thank Giti for her time and depart to make the return trip to the Ulaanbaatar spaceport. You message ahead once you're on your way and arrive to find Batu waiting for you ready to depart.`
	"CN-13470" `	For now it's back to Hai-home, and hope that Giti turns up something useful. At this point, though, maybe this whole thing is just a red herring?`
	"CN-13471" `As you return, you give Batu directions to find Xilin and then arrange evening meetings with the other diplomats. To pass the time, you search for Teeneep and Sayari, hoping to swap information with the two. You find yourself at Sayari's office, only to be met by the sight of Teeneep and Sayari arguing. Teeneep is shouting angrily at Sayari, who is trying to calm her. Their argument is so intense that they don't hear you approaching.`
	"CN-13472" `	"Am I interrupting something, Sayari?"`
	"CN-13473" `	"Teeneep, stop acting like a child!"`
	"CN-13474" `	"What kinds of deals are the Elders making with pirates?"`
	"CN-13475" `	"Now that we know the situation, how do we fix it?"`
	"CN-13476" `	"Are the two of you usually this argumentative?"`
	"CN-13477" `	"Did all of the deals involve arming pirates?"`
	"CN-13478" `	"Does Hai media not deal with this sort of thing?"`
	"CN-13479" `	"We've discussed enough. Let's get to work."`
	"CN-13480" `	It is difficult to hear precisely without making yourself known, so you struggle to understand. At first, Teeneep is annoyed, maybe saying words like: pirate, victim, orchestra, and betrayal. Sayari's responses revolve around: necessity, an angry child, guilt, and eggs. Something sets off Teeneep, and she keeps screaming "tweezers." Sayari puts a paw gently on Teeneep's shoulder and says in a soothing maternal tone, "green the moon blue." At this point, it becomes clear that the conversation is entirely in Hai, which you don't speak, and you have no idea what the two women are actually discussing.`
	"CN-13481" `	As the pair turn towards you, Teeneep looks mortified. "Captain <last>, I... I'm sorry you had to see me like this. I just... Sayari?"`
	"CN-13482" `	"Welcome back, Captain <last>. I must apologize for my friend's state. She's just discovered some rather unfortunate information."`
	"CN-13483" `	Realizing that you've arrived, Sayari tilts her head slightly to one side to indicate she's speaking to you, while not taking her eyes off Teeneep. "Welcome back, Captain <last>. I must apologize for my friend's state. She's just discovered some rather unfortunate information."`
	"CN-13484" `	"Unfortunate!" Teeneep very nearly shrieks the word. "They've been doing this for decades! Decades, Sayari! Tracking down and ultimately paying off pirates with our technology to leave us alone, even when they've hurt, killed, kidnapped, and enslaved our people!`
	"CN-13485" `	"You knew! This whole time, for a half century, you knew, and you did nothing!"`
	"CN-13486" `	Teeneep closes her eyes and breathes deeply until she has calmed herself down. It looks like this is a technique she's practiced many times.`
	"CN-13487" `	The three of you sit down once Teeneep looks ready to talk.`
	"CN-13488" `	Sayari looks at you apologetically. "She's always been quite a spark, but we usually get along very well."`
	"CN-13489" `	Teeneep adds, "Sayari has been my mentor since I was a head shorter than her. I consider her my closest and most trusted friend."`
	"CN-13490" `	Sayari says, "The Elders have been making deals with your pirates for a long time, in return for secrecy or ceasing mischief. We give them credits, supplies for their colonies, or weapons. I'm not privy to the details, but I've known for quite a while."`
	"CN-13491" `	An enraged Teeneep counters. "They give them our weapons so that they can more efficiently go and enslave other people, rather than just dealing with them properly the way they should have! One hundred and seventy three reports, Sayari. That's how many times they've done this, or something like it, and those are just the ones that came up in the sweep. There's no telling how many others might be filed improperly, missing key words, or just outside of my search range.`
	"CN-13492" `	"I thought you were a model of morality, Sayari. Now I know you're no better than they are. No better than... than..."`
	"CN-13493" `	Sayari finishes Teeneep's thought. "No better than you? The curse of power is to sacrifice your morals for protection of people under your care. I think you know that well, Teeneep. Perhaps better than I?" Teeneep looks briefly ashamed when Sayari says that.`
	"CN-13494" `	Teeneep says, "In the cases I found, a third of the deals included hostile technology: shield regenerators, guns, turrets, or anti-missile systems. Most of the deals included something else too, like money, non-hostile technology, or supplies for anarchist worlds. For the past five years, though, nearly every deal involved exchanging Hai weaponry." She looks irate at Sayari for a second.`
	"CN-13495" `	Sayari explains. "The grievance is against the Elders. There's a process to seek redress of grievances with the Elders. Teeneep needs to at least attempt to follow that process, and if she does not go through with normal resolution channels, she will be censured from public life. She must confront the Elders directly."`
	"CN-13496" `	Teeneep makes the effort to give a final, defiant snarl of disgust. "She's right," she grates out. "I hate it, but she's right. Especially because several of those reports indicate that the Navy knew of Hai on some ships and stood by while they were taken away. Which makes it your business, too."`
	"CN-13497" `	Thinking back to your meeting with Katya, you realize this is probably a step closer to a "hostile diplomatic incident."`
	"CN-13498" `	Sayari gives you a quizzical look. "Of course they do, though Tee has access to more efficient options. That's not the point, though."`
	"CN-13499" `	Sayari nods at you and looks toward Teeneep. "Look, the Elders are pretty much permanently on call at the moment. None of them are leaving <origin>, and they're in session as we speak. Let me put a priority audience request into the system, and you can probably see them this afternoon. In the meantime, why don't I order some food here? You can use my spare desk over there to prepare what you need to say."`
	"CN-13500" `	Teeneep takes a deep breath and accepts the plan with sudden and surprising grace. She gathers her pads, then sets up where indicated. "Alright, just get me some comfort food while I work on this."`
	"CN-13501" `	Sayari asks you, "Her favorite foods are acorn curry and nutmeg pie. Which should we order?"`
	"CN-13502" `	"Acorn curry sounds... good?"`
	"CN-13503" `	"I'd love some nutmeg pie."`
	"CN-13504" `	The pie tastes and feels like a meaty shepherd's pie, even though it's all nuts and vegetables. The subtle taste of nutmeg really brings it all together, accenting the acorns quite well.`
	"CN-13505" `	You eat the most delicious curry you've ever tasted, with a perfect combination of acorns and the best Indian spices. It's amazing what Hai can do with nuts; no wonder Teeneep considers this a comfort food.`
	"CN-13506" `	After a short hour of frantic work, Teeneep leads you to a room within the government complex. Sayari explains, "This is a Special Adjunctive Triad: three Elders with diverse views, specialized knowledge, and the power to take limited immediate actions."`
	"CN-13507" `	"What does that mean?"`
	"CN-13508" `	"Thank you, Sayari."`
	"CN-13509" `	"Our governmental structure is directed towards stability, but sometimes there's a problem that merits rapid action. When needed, the Council will nominate a group of Elders, or even just one, to take actions the full Council would otherwise spend weeks deliberating upon. Their power is limited, and is defined when they're nominated, but their dictate is immediate. If necessity pushes beyond their preset limits, they can make a recommendation with a fast track to a full Council discussion. In trying times like these, they may get a meeting by tomorrow."`
	"CN-13510" `	The three Hai Elders are sat behind a table, and the Elder in the center gestures for all of you to sit down in those strange Hai chairs. After a small, calm exchange in Hai between Sayari and the central Elder, he motions for you to speak.`
	"CN-13511" `	Instead, Teeneep begins. "Respected Elders, I have extensive evidence of a sustained kidnapping campaign in Hai space, facilitated by pirates you've been arm-"`
	"CN-13512" `	"Enough," says an Elder, raising his hand. "We know about your views, the 'five thousand missing Hai,' and your organization's media connections. You're already risking larger issues with your current actions. We are here to speak to your witness. Captain <last>," he says, turning to you, "tell us your views on these matters."`
	"CN-13513" `	You think carefully of Katya's warning as you prepare to respond.`
	"CN-13514" `	"Why have you been making deals with pirates?"`
	"CN-13515" `	"Your secrecy is rapidly degrading, and pirate activity is on the rise despite these deals. Are you sure they're worth sacrificing your morals?"`
	"CN-13516" `	"A trusted source has warned me of a hostile diplomatic incident that may happen if the Republic finds out you're arming pirates."`
	"CN-13517" `	The left Elder says, "Secrecy, mostly, to prevent a refugee crisis if the Hai become common knowledge. The bulk of the resources go to a few large pirate groups that control the anarchist worlds. We fund the development and protection of their planets, in return for them ensuring the wrong people don't find us."`
	"CN-13518" `	Another Elder adds, "Most of the deals are much smaller, though: when a pirate gang causes mischief, we pay them to stop. Hostages, theft, raids, and the like. Usually, the same gang never bothers us again." Teeneep perks up at the word "hostages," but doesn't speak.`
	"CN-13519" `	The middle Elder counters, "We cannot be certain that the pirate activity will continue. With the proper trades, we may be able to return to the status quo."`
	"CN-13520" `	"That is a best-case scenario," says the right Elder, "but if matters continue to worsen, we'll change our approach." The other two nod in agreement.`
	"CN-13521" `	The Elder on the right disagrees. "At this point, the Republic is too weakened to be a threat. I'm confident they will see reason, for now."`
	"CN-13522" `	Fortunately, the middle Elder contradicts him. "We don't want to risk larger problems with humanity. If the situation continues to worsen, then we'll change our approach." The other two find that argument convincing and nod.`
	"CN-13523" `	An Elder concludes the meeting. "The Elder Council asked us to take charge of the pirate situation, and we now have a plan of action on the pirate deals. However, I've heard enough of this 'kidnapping' conspiracy theory. Our meeting is adjourned." Teeneep's fury is palpable, but she remains silent as the three exit.`
	"CN-13524" `	"That could have gone better."`
	"CN-13525" `	"It sounds like we've made some progress!"`
	"CN-13526" `	As you walk back to the diplomatic quarter, Sayari begins. "They didn't do anything, but at least they agreed to solve the problems when they become disasters."`
	"CN-13527" `	Teeneep objects, "We can't wait for a disaster before solving this!"`
	"CN-13528" `	Sayari agrees. "You're right, of course, in this matter. The Elders have ever struggled with change. They're not wise for this, but they were not elected to be so. They were elected to continue the long march of incremental development. Besides, you know far better than most exactly what challenges they've contended with these past couple of decades. More of them have died or retired than been unelected."`
	"CN-13529" `	"What can we do to solve this, Sayari?"`
	"CN-13530" `	"Teeneep, I think we need quick action. You mentioned something back in the cave."`
	"CN-13531" `	The three of you head back to the diplomatic quarter and where Xilin and Batu lead you to a conference room. They consult Sayari, and occasionally Teeneep, in a long discussion about the Navy knowing of the pirate troubles and willfully not intervening. Xilin sympathizes and suggests the Hai ask the Navy to rescue those captured.`
	"CN-13532" `	Batu cuts in. "I'm sorry, deputy minister, I have not had time to fully brief you. The Navy already considered this and said 'not under any circumstances' will they 'clean up the Hai's mess.'" In the slightly stunned pause following his words he draws breath and adds somewhat less intensely, "It's, uh, possible that five thousand missing civilians was not one of the things they considered when they said that."`
	"CN-13533" `	Xilin frowns. "We should definitely present that case. They'll have to do another whole round of private briefings, and then no doubt a large debate. Even if we started today, Parliament won't be able to act for months. I'll kick things off, but you'll have to be patient."`
	"CN-13534" `	When Teeneep makes a noise as if to speak, Sayari silences her with a gentle touch and thanks Xilin in the formal capacity. He briefly thanks you for delivering Batu safely and then the two excuse themselves to see if they can get a hold of someone before their day ended.`
	"CN-13535" `	"Should we wait for Parliament to respond?"`
	"CN-13536" `	"Do you have any other ideas?"`
	"CN-13537" `	Teeneep sighs in exasperation. "We can't wait for your parliament to spend months deliberating. Sayari, you have a crisis of your own here, and I cannot accept a resolution without an avenue to rescue our people and put a stop to this for good. I would hope you cannot either..."`
	"CN-13538" `	Teeneep says with certainty, "I must go to the Unfettered. If they can be swayed, then the Elders may be pressured into acting."`
	"CN-13539" `	"Captain <last>," she says, giving you a calculating look. "I would very much appreciate it if you'd be so kind as to take me."`
	"CN-13540" `	"Aren't those Hai pirates? No, that sounds unwise."`
	"CN-13541" `	"Of course, Teeneep. Let's go."`
	"CN-13542" `	"Teeneep, no! You cannot just commandeer the Captain to act as your chauffeur wherever you want to go," says Sayari. "<last> has an important role here in this crisis."`
	"CN-13543" `	"And what would you have them do next then?" When Sayari seems at a loss to respond, Teeneep continues. "Exactly. Your crisis is mostly resolved behind closed doors, but this crisis requires transportation. The thing you seem to be missing is that they're the same crisis, Sayari. They can't be resolved separately."`
	"CN-13544" `	Sayari slumps back in her chair with a huff, for a moment looking as old as she says she is. Teeneep waits patiently while her friend spends a good thirty seconds seriously thinking about something. "She is right, <last>," says Sayari eventually. "This is worth trying. Please take her to the Unfettered if that is what she wishes; their government is on <destination>, but please, be careful."`
	"CN-13545" `	As you both get up to leave Teeneep walks over and places a hand gently on the old diplomat's shoulder. "They call themselves the True Hai, maybe it's time they demonstrated it."`
	"CN-13546" `Teeneep makes a request on your approach and then goes to prepare. You are subsequently directed to a restricted landing zone near their government complex. When she reappears Teeneep has prepared to meet the Unfettered in a somewhat surprising manner; she's wearing what looks like a fencing outfit. There are two swords on her back and several balanced knives on her belt. She's wearing a headband with a medallion on it that looks like an athletic medal.`
	"CN-13547" `	She pays you for the trip and explains, "These blades are not ceremonial. Bring your gun with you, but hand it to them when we reach the chambers, or the Unfettered may think you're an assassin. Trust me, we'll be fine.`
	"CN-13548" `	"Let's go," she says.`
	"CN-13549" `	"What's your plan?"`
	"CN-13550" `	"To Unfettered Hai leadership, this meeting is all a political ploy. They know it's in their best interest to help us. It will raise public opinion towards them among the 'Fettered' and likely lure more recruits to their side. But before they agree, I have to prove myself in front of their troops. If I don't, the public's perception will be that the Unfettered leaders helped a weak coward. Fortunately, dangerous sports have a tendency to open doors for you in Hai society. They're an essential hobby for anyone who hopes to have influence, and I have kept up with mine reasonably well. It's been a couple decades since I won anything, but I was regional champion in fencing a number of times when I was really into it."`
	"CN-13551" `	Teeneep goes to disembark, pauses, then turns back to you. "Actually, before we leave the ship, there was something I wanted to make sure I explained before we meet the Unfettered leadership: I'm carrying real weapons for a reason. This meeting will probably seem violent, and that will probably make you think the Unfettered are a barbaric people. They're not; they 'play up' their violent nature. It's a hard concept to explain - we have Hai words for this that don't translate well into your language. That's the simplest way I can think to explain it without spending twenty minutes here, so it'll have to suffice."`
	"CN-13552" `	She glances around. "Besides, we're already close to running late. Let's get going."`
	"CN-13553" `	You enter the complex and she speaks as you pass through a hallway filled with battle trophies. "I have requested this conversation happen in your language. This is not only politeness for your benefit, but it is also to mine. To shy from a challenge is not befitting a True Hai, and for this matter I think your tongue may be more eloquent. I should have them at a disadvantage in using it, as well." A moment later you reach a guarded door; you hand your gun to an Unfettered guard and hope Teeneep understands the Unfettered Hai as much as she claims to. Beyond, you enter a large room filled with uniformed Hai. You notice many of them have swords similar to Teeneep's, though they look more ceremonial than functional.`
	"CN-13554" `	As Teeneep walks in, an Unfettered moves to block her path. From the extensive decorations on his uniform, it appears he's a high-ranking officer. "You're not welcome here, False Hai." He starts to push her away. In one motion, Teeneep spins around, unsheathes a sword, and swipes it across his arm, drawing blood. The Hai grunts, surprised, and steps aside to let Teeneep pass. She walks toward the gigantic leader of the Unfettered, whose face betrays his surprise and admiration.`
	"CN-13555" `	(Walk in and join Teeneep.)`
	"CN-13556" `	(Stand in the room's entrance and watch.)`
	"CN-13557" `	As you enter the room, a pair of Unfettered grab you. Teeneep draws a throwing knife, saying with intensity, "Let Captain <last> go. Now." The Unfettered let go immediately, and she nods for you to stay where you are, sheathing the knife.`
	"CN-13558" `	The leader's voice booms from where he sits at the other end of the room. "Come, False Hai. You have entered here to make a case, have at it."`
	"CN-13559" `	Teeneep explains to the leader, "Five thousand Hai have been enslaved by human pirates, or vaporized when the human authorities have shot down their captors with no regard for the innocents on board. The Elders do not act. Will not act. They know, and do nothing. I have learned that they have known of some pirates who they felt were too much of a headache for decades, and that rather than hunt them down, they have paid them with technology. Our weapons and technology. Paid them off to simply leave us alone, and not even to return any Hai they may have captured.`
	"CN-13560" `	"You were once the protectors of all Hai. I would honor that not out of political opportunism, but because our people need heroes and protectors that the Elders are not. So I stand here to ask you to be so again. Free our people from slavery and kill their human slavers."`
	"CN-13561" `	The Unfettered leader responds, "Your people have outlawed and abandoned us. You give us insulting food donations with propaganda on them. You block our ships from returning to Hai-home. Why should we help you, a race of slothful cowards? Your people are willingly blind and lost, an insult to all Hai."`
	"CN-13562" `	Teeneep suddenly takes three strides forward, closing the distance between her and the Unfettered leader in less than a second. You had forgotten how quick Hai are; few humans could do what she just did. "I challenge you for rule of the Unfettered military!"`
	"CN-13563" `	"You haven't the authority to do that," he responds, laughing.`
	"CN-13564" `	"Besides..." you see one of the other Unfettered to the right of the leader begin to step out. "You would ha..." Teeneep cuts the leader off as she draws a throwing knife and launches it. It zips through the air, and spears the shoulder of the Unfettered who began to move, embedding itself in the wall behind and pinning them in place.`
	"CN-13565" `	"I would have to do what, defeat your right hand first?" She takes a step back and smirks at him. "Now, will you face a woman half your size?" From her expression, you're unsure if she genuinely has that much faith in her abilities, or if this is a bluff.`
	"CN-13566" `	The Unfettered leader pauses, then smiles. "There is no need. Even on our planets, I've rarely met a Hai half as brave as you. You have the courage to turn an act into action. You are a True Hai, and we protect our own. You have vouched for the value of the lives of these Hai, so I say now we are willing to send our fleets to their aid. I would come myself."`
	"CN-13567" `	She re-sheaths her swords and calls you over. "I have brought with me one of the greatest war heroes of the humans."`
	"CN-13568" `	(Walk to her.)`
	"CN-13569" `	"Captain <first> <last> led great fleets during a civil war of the humans. We will have the honor of fighting alongside this warrior of the humans."`
	"CN-13570" `	He looks at you appraisingly. "That is well, but there is a matter yet to be addressed. We cannot just 'waltz' through Hai and human space without being blasted. How will you convince your Elders to allow us passage?"`
	"CN-13571" `	"They will not allow it," says Teeneep. "We must force them."`
	"CN-13572" `	A round of muttering breaks out around the room.`
	"CN-13573" `	"The threat of true war, then..." In the ensuing silence you swear you could have heard a pin drop.`
	"CN-13574" `	Teeneep bows her head. "I know it is distasteful to consider this sort of show."`
	"CN-13575" `	The Unfettered leader considers her for a long moment before raising his head and slowly assessing the room, making eye contact with each of the others standing by.`
	"CN-13576" `	All bravado and bluster seems to be gone from him now as he finally speaks. "Five thousand Hai, you say?"`
	"CN-13577" `	"At least," she says, lifting her head to lock eyes with him.`
	"CN-13578" `	With the weight of a proclamation he responds, "Then it shall be so."`
	"CN-13579" `	There is a moment where it seems as if something respectful is being observed and then, like a switch being flicked, the energy returns and the leader smiles at you as those around start jostling and making quiet remarks to each other.`
	"CN-13580" `	The Unfettered leader seems to sense your confusion. "Neither True Hai nor Fettered truly desire to shed the blood of the other. Our disagreement is a protest, a lesson to be learned that we are learning but slowly. Perhaps it is time though that we demonstrate the seriousness of our resolve, especially if the Elders have become so mired as for it to have come to this."`
	"CN-13581" `	He grins. "I look forward to seeing you fight, human. Now both of you, go. Do what you must."`
	"CN-13582" `	Teeneep turns and leads you out, making sure they return your weapon as you leave. "Now we must return to <planet> and address the Elders again. Hopefully they will now see reason."`
	"CN-13583" `Upon your return, Teeneep lodges a formal demand for another audience with the Elders, including the context that she has acquired support from the Unfettered with appropriate proof. Once sent, Sayari steps out for a while to talk to someone and ensure that the demand is being processed with appropriate speed, leaving you and Teeneep alone in her office.`
	"CN-13584" `	Teeneep spends a few moments more doing some other things at her terminal before finally sitting back with an expression of quiet determination. In the quiet she turns to you from her seat and says, "Well, all the pieces are set, now I suppose all that remains is to play out the moves."`
	"CN-13585" `	"What will happen now then?"`
	"CN-13586" `	"Do you think the Elders will listen?"`
	"CN-13587" `	"Will there truly be a war between Hai and Unfettered?"`
	"CN-13588" `	"What are the other options?"`
	"CN-13589" `	"Who is Aimet?"`
	"CN-13590" `	She shrugs. "It is honestly quite hard to say. I struggle to believe that the Elders could be so unwilling to act that they would risk escalating the standoff with the Unfettered into a real war. Our brethren are no longer merely a disaffected rabble of veterans, camping on the one world that supported radical change. They are a truly empowered movement with consolidated support at home and sympathizers amongst the Hai at large."`
	"CN-13591" `	She sighs. "I wish to believe so, but part of me I can no longer ignore does not think it actually likely. Still, it is essential that I try with everything I have to make them do so. Otherwise there will be change, and we can be an unpredictable people in the face of that."`
	"CN-13592" `	She frowns and gently shakes her head. "No, or at least not yet. The willingness of the Unfettered to threaten war is essential to all of the possible paths from here. Even if the Elders refuse to take action, there are more steps between this meeting and that outcome. The options are not yet exhausted, though they are rapidly dwindling. With luck, though, Aimet's influence might tip the situation in our favor."`
	"CN-13593" `	"Ah, well those are difficult to explain, since the options worth using will depend on exactly what happens in the meeting. One thing Sayari was very right to remind me of before is that there are normal channels and processes to follow, and those must be followed. We're an old people, Captain <last>, and not always a very patient people. We've forged a system of government with systems and processes to allow almost any internal situation to be handled without resorting to base hysteria, and to actively punish and isolate those who try and subvert those processes. It is a difficult pill to swallow sometimes, but it works, and it has ensured stability since before humans learned to bash rocks together."`
	"CN-13594" `	Her mouth quirks in a sly little smile. "Aimet has always been the master navigator of those systems. He's responsible for improving one of them for the first time in two thousand years." She frowns. "It's actually very odd that he wasn't chosen for the Triad last time we were here."`
	"CN-13595" `	"He is the..." she pauses to look up aimlessly, "I don't think it translates quite right. You have a phenomenon in your language where you amalgamate words sometimes, like an engineer who works specifically on solutions to problems might be called a 'solutioneer.' We have a similar thing with our words for political systems and navigator. It's a title he has earned."`
	"CN-13596" `	She spreads her arms, 'palms' up, in a human gesture indicating a loss for words. "Our system of government has systems and processes to allow almost any internal situation to be handled without resorting to base hysteria, and to actively punish and isolate those who try and subvert those processes. It is a difficult pill to swallow sometimes, but it works, and it has ensured stability since before humans learned to bash rocks together. Aimet is the master navigator of those systems. He's responsible for improving one of them for the first time in two thousand years."`
	"CN-13597" `	Teeneep's console beeps a moment prior to Sayari's slightly breathless return. A message, entirely in your language, is displayed on the screen; it announces an emergency meeting of the full Elder Council in under an hour.`
	"CN-13598" `	Sayari steps across to Teeneep and glances at the message. "I needn't have left this room. We must prepare quickly, we're going to have an escort..."`
	"CN-13599" `	Teeneep's expression darkens, but she quickly ensures she has what she needs before a group of Council security staff arrive to take you to the chambers. This is not the first time you've seen the room, but it is the first time you've seen it full. There is a small desk and seat at the front of the central circle, opposite the entry point, which was not occupied when you entered here for dealing with Scar's Legion but now hosts a very serious Hai bearing unusual marks of office. Sayari sees your line of vision and nudges you, conveying in a whisper, "That's the moderator. They're only required when more than two thirds of the council is in attendance, and when there's a debate or petition to address."`
	"CN-13600" `	She glances around the room and raises an eyebrow. "This is a closed session, which is quite unusual for a full Council Assembly. This does not bode well."`
	"CN-13601" `	As the security staff take their place, the moderator walks over to address you while the Elders are still filtering in and muttering to each other. "Now, before we begin, I would like to confirm. I understand you are able to act as a witness, and confirm that the threat carried from the Unfettered was indeed real. Is this correct?"`
	"CN-13602" `	"That is correct."`
	"CN-13603" `	"I can also testify to the human position on the matter."`
	"CN-13604" `	The moderator pulls a strange face and says, "Right, well, I doubt that will be necessary.`
	"CN-13605" `	"Thank you, Captain. Since you have become involved as a witness, protocol dictates that the session will be held in your language, though for the sake of order normal council directions will still be in Hai. We will begin in a moment."`
	"CN-13606" `	After everyone is set in place, the moderator abruptly starts. "Teeneep has provided a confession about her visit to the Unfettered, incitement to war, involvement of outside government in internal Hai matters, and other concerns. She has justified this by an argument of necessity, that it is essential for action to be taken to produce both a peaceful outcome for the ongoing crisis with humanity and to heal a hole in the heart of our society."`
	"CN-13607" `	When the moderator refers to "healing the hole," it is spoken with an emphasis that implies heavy quotation, and you can hear the muttering of translations and scoffs rippling out among the Elders in the room.`
	"CN-13608" `	Sayari hisses with distaste and quietly says, "The framing of this is terrible, someone has already decided what outcome they'd like to get and has got in on this process early."`
	"CN-13609" `	The moderator calls something out in Hai which ends with 'Teeneep' and Sayari translates, "The Council hears Teeneep."`
	"CN-13610" `	Not visibly disheartened by the situation, Teeneep steps into the middle and begins. She makes her case thoroughly and passionately, but with a clearly well-practiced presentation structure, ensuring that the full background for the situation is laid out for those present. Some Elders make snide comments at various points, but the moderator shuts them down and those most skeptical settle for being merely disengaged. When she presents the Unfettered's position as an offer of assistance there is a smattering of largely disbelieving sounds, though when she speaks of their willingness to force the matter the tone of the conversation gets remarkably more tense. "If you don't act, they will. Whether that's with you, or through you," she finishes.`
	"CN-13611" `	One of the more stubborn Elders stands up, heralded by the moderator. "The Unfettered have made serious attempts to push through at Wah Ki before, to no avail. More recently, they've been more trouble again, and again we have organized more than enough security to keep their disruption contained, even with the current human crisis. This threat is ridiculous, and the Unfettered would not dare, not while they are so dependent on our food and medical supplies these past years. They would most certainly sacrifice many thousands of lives in the pursuit of misguided justice for a mere handful."`
	"CN-13612" `	"You are blind. Blind and old and foolish," snaps Teeneep, but another Elder has leaped to their feet and the moderator cuts her off with a rebuke that you don't need translated to know what it means.`
	"CN-13613" `	After being properly heralded, the new Elder addresses you. "I understand Teeneep has enlisted you as her gopher. You have my sympathy. I have no doubt that your continued involvement means that you accept her conspiracy theories that many of the pirate activities, specifically relating to kidnapping and people smuggling, are a coordinated effort. So I will not waste time retreading your position on points she has just laid out. I must ask you of this recent interaction, though. Tell me, how would you characterize Teeneep's meeting with the Unfettered Choot'k: constructive, aggressive, or something else?"`
	"CN-13614" `	"It was a constructive discussion."`
	"CN-13615" `	"I witnessed the test of two wills."`
	"CN-13616" `	"The meeting was poignant."`
	"CN-13617" `	"Very aggressive and confronting."`
	"CN-13618" `	You hear many sighs, and several Elders shrug, but nobody seems surprised, just disappointed. "They grow ever more brazen in their desire for change," says the Elder. "Thank you, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-13619" `	Many elders chuckle around the room. The Elder says, "Ah, our pair of old rivals, divided by Cloudfire. The embers are not yet quenched then." At this, Teeneep rolls her eyes and the Elder departs.`
	"CN-13620" `	There is a quiet shuffling as some of the elders sit up a little straighter. The Elder says, "A common ground between rivals, a fearsome thing indeed."`
	"CN-13621" `	A roomful of laughter engulfs your words, but many Elders appear offended by their peers' mockery. The Elder who questioned you explains, "The Elders and the Unfettered have different views of what constitutes a 'constructive discussion.' You lack the biases of a Hai. If you say it was constructive, I believe you." The tone of the room changes after that, as the laughter ends. Most Elders appear to agree with your assessment, and many who laughed look ashamed.`
	"CN-13622" `	Sayari gives you a meaningful look and whispers, "A lot of them paid attention to that..."`
	"CN-13623" `	The next Elder to their feet is an older lady Hai, and her expression alone is enough to cause a flicker of concern to disrupt Teeneep's careful mask of calm. She gestures around the room, pointing with a digit and squinting at several others in the room. "You are, all of you, cowards. This is the highest chamber of the Hai, elected to protect and serve, and to ensure the enduring stability of the great edifice which is now a hundred millennia of stability. This one here has sought to upend that authority and topple that edifice in favor of nothing more than a statistical blip. Five thousand Hai in two hundred years is barely a concern. That many managed to get themselves killed swimming with Gelo Appanoh in the last decade alone! Freedom through peace, peace through order, order through security, and security through secrecy. This is the mandate of this chamber, and no matter how virtuous the challenger may be, this threat cannot be allowed to stand!"`
	"CN-13624" `	There is a growing rumble of assent as the crescendo of her impassioned statement crests to its conclusion. She levels a clawed finger directly at Teeneep and the room is filled with the angry cries of both those emboldened by her diatribe and those distressed by her implication. The moderator makes several attempts to restore order as over a dozen Elders jump to their feet, but the cacophony is not so easily restrained. At your side, Sayari's expression is ashen, but Teeneep seems to be seeking out a particular face somewhere in the room with a fierce intensity.`
	"CN-13625" `	There is a shift in the sound of the room and your attention is drawn to one Hai in particular, a particularly elderly man who struggles to his feet in a series of pained stages. The effect on the assembly is profound, though. A ripple of silence flows outward from his position, and Elders all around promptly drop back into their seats as it reaches them, leaving a scant handful who were too slow to react to have their final words trail off awkwardly. Only the last speaker remains on her feet, the moderator weakly announcing in Hai what you know to be, "The council hears Aimet."`
	"CN-13626" `	"Security through secrecy..." He coughs. "You throw that in there as if it were always so Gemnali but, unlike you, I was there when it was added to the mandate of this chamber."`
	"CN-13627" `	He peers around the room, and you realize he is blind, or nearly so. "Freedom may be achieved through peace, but peace must not be maintained at the cost of freedom. Order may not be pursued at the cost of peace, nor security at the cost of order. Always this mandate must be considered in both directions. To censure this woman, to resist action on this matter... You would have us pursue secrecy at the cost of security."`
	"CN-13628" `	He coughs again, and it echoes in the silence of nearly a hundred Hai holding their breath. When he continues, his voice grows stronger and sharper. "My eyes may not see as well as they used to, but there are many in this chamber who are yet too blind to see. The edifice of our stability is not threatened by this woman who would have us restore security to our lost brethren. It is you who would use her virtue to topple it yourself."`
	"CN-13629" `	The silence stretches with all eyes on Gemnali. She clenches her fists, shaking with barely suppressed emotion, before collapsing back into her seat as if physically struck.`
	"CN-13630" `	Whatever spell had held the room is immediately broken and a susurrus of murmuring rises to fill its space. Within the noise a certain phrase starts to be repeated multiple times, drawing an expression of shock from Sayari.`
	"CN-13631" `	"What are they saying?"`
	"CN-13632" `	"What just happened?"`
	"CN-13633" `	She glances at you briefly. "They are saying: Veeheylur and Misanaya fight over Eyrisen." Her tone carries with it a sense of awe, and despite the growing volume in the room she leans in close to you and continues in scarcely more than a whisper, "The Mythos has been invoked."`
	"CN-13634" `	As Aimet painfully resumes his seat, one Elder who has thus far been maintaining a fairly neutral demeanor in this seems to regain a certain sense of himself and stands up, quickly heralded by the moderator, who struggles to compose himself suitably. "I think the Council has heard enough. The petitioner is entitled to a closing statement, unless there is objection?"`
	"CN-13635" `	None of those assembled who might object seem to have recovered their composure enough to stand up quickly, and the moderator, perhaps sensing a politic moment to intervene, quickly announces the closing of the interrogation and calls the Council to hear Teeneep again.`
	"CN-13636" `	Teeneep quickly plasters back on her mask of calm as best she is able to and says, "Thank you all for your ears. You are those we trust to decide, but know this: If you will not listen to this here, then apparently I must now be the one to present a pathway to avoid war. The Unfettered are committed, no matter what path I choose now. If you do not take action, I will make the history of inaction I have discovered public knowledge. Every Hai from Greenwater to Snowfeather will know by the end of the day."`
	"CN-13637" `	One Elder cries out, "You wouldn't dare!" To which Teeneep responds, "It is already scheduled to happen unless I actively stop it!"`
	"CN-13638" `	Before any further exchange can occur, though, the moderator bellows for security to escort you all from the session and shouts down the offending Elder for impropriety. The two remain engaged in a lively shouting match as you depart, the echoes following you until the chamber doors are shut.`
	"CN-13639" `	Teeneep moves to pull out a datapad, but both the security officers and Sayari step in to stay her hand. "The chamber will have to vote on the proposition to act," says Sayari, looking at Teeneep pointedly. "You know that external contact is forbidden during the deliberation grace window."`
	"CN-13640" `	"The deliberation grace window?"`
	"CN-13641" `	"So what, do we just wait?"`
	"CN-13642" `	Teeneep sighs and points an exasperated expression your way. "Yes, after certain types of chamber hearings there is an enforced period where the petitioner must remain isolated to the chamber's waiting area, including digitally. I forgot for a moment."`
	"CN-13643" `	Sayari smiles at you. "Don't worry though, it's only for about twenty-three of your minutes." She eyes the security officer warily. "After a session such as that though, the traditional wisdom is to wait in relative silence."`
	"CN-13644" `	"If it wasn't a closed session we wouldn't be doing this," harrumphs Teeneep. "I hadn't realized it would be so didn't plan for it."`
	"CN-13645" `	After only about seventeen minutes the moderator slips out and exchanges some words with Teeneep and Sayari before re-entering the chamber. "We've been released," says Sayari. "They've voted to take no immediate action, either for or against Teeneep."`
	"CN-13646" `	Teeneep just shakes her head, pulls out a datapad, and quickly taps a few times. "Well, that was going to happen in an hour. No point waiting, though. Let's get dinner."`
	"CN-13647" `	(Get dinner.)`
	"CN-13648" `	(Decline and maybe eat with the diplomats.)`
	"CN-13649" `	There are some perfectly adequate meal places in the cafeteria area. There you manage to join Alondo and Remington, who have a surprisingly civilized conversation the entire time. Albeit mostly about work.`
	"CN-13650" `	You're still finishing up a little shortly after they leave, at which point a harried-looking Sayari appears and practically sprints across the room to you.`
	"CN-13651" `	You join Teeneep and Sayari at a fusion restaurant about a block down the road from the 'Elders' Chambers' - which turns out to be the official name of the whole government complex.`
	"CN-13652" `	Having finished your main meal, and while waiting for some dessert that Teeneep has ordered, Sayari pulls out her datapad. "You know, while we're waiting. It's probably a good idea to check the damage. I don't know if your plan is actually going to have the desired effect, you know. Especially after that scene in there; no doubt the long tooths will get riled up."`
	"CN-13653" `	"What was that in there about the Mythos?"`
	"CN-13654" `	"What will happen if they get riled up?"`
	"CN-13655" `	Teeneep rolls her eyes, putting her drink down with a sharp clink. "It's superstition. Humans have their religions, the Hai have the Mythos. It's a collection of stories about Hai who lived incredibly long lives and were involved in or responsible for incredibly influential events in our history, or more accurately pre-history for the vast majority of them. If you believe the stories literally, these Hai transcended mortal limitations and achieved immortality; our word for them translates imprecisely to either 'immortals' or 'imperishables.' When someone embodies a character from it well enough, there's a set of people who will believe it's actually that person come back to steer things.`
	"CN-13656" `	"Someone in there has linked that scene to a story, in which I am implicated as Eyrisen."`
	"CN-13657" `	She scoffs and waves a paw dismissively. "The contingencies shouldn't be affected. Superstition is mostly dead, it's really only the Elders that subscribe to it." She pauses and looks at Sayari. "The plan will work just fine."`
	"CN-13658" `	Sayari grumbles, "There's plenty of older Hai, those 'long tooths,' that align with particular political factions. They also tend to subscribe, at least selectively, to the superstitions. Despite what Teeneep says, I would not count out the potential impact that scene in there could have on the situation."`
	"CN-13659" `	She rounds on Teeneep. "I mean, seriously, Tee, what will you do if the plan doesn't play out fine? Will the Hai actually have to shed our brethren's blood with lethal intent?"`
	"CN-13660" `	Teeneep just sips her drink and shakes her head. "Oh, Sayari, you really are getting too long in the tooth yourself for domestic politics these days."`
	"CN-13661" `	A moment later Sayari squeaks and looks up in horror. "You triggered an election?! This wasn't just making it public, you had the petition for redress ready to go all along!"`
	"CN-13662" `	She scrolls down on her pad several times and begins to mutter, "Oh dear, oh no." She lapses into Hai for a moment before returning. "It hit the trending issues board, and triggered the safety policy alert response. People got direct notifications that this was an issue. There are over two billion supporting votes for an injunctive action and it's only been two hours... this is what you hoped would happen, isn't it?"`
	"CN-13663" `Teeneep places a gentle hand on Sayari's arm. "Better this than war."`
	"CN-13664" `	Sayari's eyes are alive with thinly-veiled panic as she slams her hand down on the table. "Captain <last>, you must leave immediately. Get on your ship and fly to <planet> right now! The winds of change are afoot and we will have an election. They'll hit the threshold in maybe only twenty minutes, and it'll take maybe thirty more for the bureaucracy to act on it. The instant the election is announced formally, all non-essential ships will be grounded, all communication in or out of Hai space will be cut off, and the border will be sealed to everyone - not in the polite way either. If even one ship tries to cross the border to investigate... there's no telling what will happen."`
	"CN-13665" `	"Go, go with all possible haste! I will tell the others, but right now you must go. Now!"`
	"CN-13666" `The spaceport appears to be operating on a skeleton staff with an increased security presence. Plenty of ships are still coming and going, but they seem to be here strictly on business. The usual milling of tourists, haggling of merchants, and perusal of jobs all appear to have been suspended in favor of efficient boarding and disembarking of Hai with places to go and goods with places to be. The displays in the main thoroughfare have been switched over to wall-to-wall election coverage and the rest of the non-essential sections of the spaceport have been closed.`
	"CN-13667" `	Some of the restaurants that are currently closed have set up temporary stands near the displays with the most standing room in the vicinity, and are serving food to those who have no choice but to be here for some duration of time.`
	"CN-13668" `	(Get some food.)`
	"CN-13669" `	(Ask around for an update.)`
	"CN-13670" `	The stalls have a range of tasty Hai and Hai-human fusion cuisines in disposable takeaway trays. At first glance they appear to be some sort of cardboard equivalent, but a Hai near you finishes their meal and then begins nibbling on the tray afterwards.`
	"CN-13671" `	The election coverage is in Hai, naturally, but there's a strong sense that people are still scrambling to have relevant commentary on such short notice and with no prior opinion polling in lead-up. It certainly seems like things are heated. Different charts being presented for the same areas seem to suggest that there's a great deal of controversy and some very strong opinions being thrown around. A number of the Hai nearby make some sounds of concern occasionally, but they do not stay around to comment. Unfortunately, nothing comes up in your language by the time you've finished your food.`
	"CN-13672" `	(Eat the tray.)`
	"CN-13673" `	The tray is hard and difficult to break. It does have a remarkably intriguing combination of nutty and herby flavors that would probably be quite enjoyable, but you don't quite have the teeth for it.`
	"CN-13674" `	When you ask around, a lot of Hai don't seem to be very interested in talking to you. One, in particular, looks like they recognized you and actively avoided you. After approaching a half dozen Hai unsuccessfully, one takes pity and comes to you. He appears to be of middling years and extends a paw to shake your hand in a friendly manner.`
	"CN-13675" `	"Apologies for my brethren's behavior, Captain, but this is a very important time for the Hai. Many are under significant strain to be informed and also maintain their essential business as captains themselves. There are a number of regulations for Hai citizens to stay on top of if they are frequently moving between worlds during the period, and they haven't had the time to prepare that they usually would."`
	"CN-13676" `	"Is politics a very important matter for the Hai?"`
	"CN-13677" `	"What do they need to prepare for an election?"`
	"CN-13678" `	He gestures at the various Hai captains paying close attention to the election coverage or scrolling information feeds on their data pads. "No one is more closely tied to the specific dynamics of trade between our worlds, and the subtleties of what makes them healthy, than our merchant captains are. I believe the human phrase is that they have their, 'fingers on the pulses,' yes? This election has nothing to do with economics, and yet all the candidates have historical economic platforms that they can be expected to bring with them. These captains are being bombarded by queries from friends, families, organizations they trade with frequently, institutions they studied at or supported, local media outlets, and more.`
	"CN-13679" `	"Ordinarily, they would spend at least a month checking on different things and solidifying their positions before an election. A snap election has robbed them of that preparation time, and so they are stressed and concerned. Many, including myself, will have to put up with the consequences of this election for at least the next two decades before any meaningful correction can occur, should the outcome be unfortunate. Long is the timeline that a Hai merchant must consider when asked who should be supported in an election."`
	"CN-13680" `	He smiles. "You must not have considered the Hai lifespan, Captain. A human might not understand the situation to have nuanced opinions until they are more than twenty years of age, and by the time they are fifty the outcome of their votes are unlikely to have a large effect on the remainder of their lives. It is comparatively easy, if things are okay, for you to simply ignore your politics in favor of other things. A Hai may live for over three hundred years, if they are quite fortunate, but will in most cases still be trying to make a livelihood halfway through that. Barring accident, stupidity, or malicious action, a Hai will typically live to see the longer term effects of their voting preferences. The more wealth a Hai has, the more significant those effects are likely to be. There are few Hai more politically aware than merchant captains, and fewer still whose opinions on the effects of change are trusted more widely.`
	"CN-13681" `	"Our merchant captains are bombarded by queries from friends, families, organizations they trade with frequently, institutions they studied at or supported, local media outlets, and more. Ordinarily, they would spend at least a month checking on different things and solidifying their positions before an election. A snap election has robbed them of that preparation time, and so they are stressed and concerned."`
	"CN-13682" `	There is a gentle ping, and the Hai looks at a device on his wrist. "And now it seems my ship is finished refueling, and I too must be about my business. Safe travels, Captain."`
	"CN-13683" `	With nothing else to do here you return to your ship.`
	"CN-13684" `Mountaintop appears to be in chaos by the time you dock and make your way onto the promenade. Discarded equipment is scattered in many places and a whole group of Hai are desperately lining up to try and get on one of the Hai merchant ships to return to Hai space, all while trying to pretend like it's for some movie exercise. A selection of brave but confused tourists are trying to work out how to get from one place to another, now that the line has disrupted all normal flow through this section. Someone is crying behind a greenscreen, and a great many people involved both in running the station and making the movie seem to be frantically attempting to keep up with events. The hectic order that was present last time is nowhere to be seen.`
	"CN-13685" `	You can't find Terry. She seems to be battling organizational fires and moving round the station fast enough that by the time you get to where she's last been, she's already moved on somewhere else; possibly twice. However, Turner manages to find you in relatively short order.`
	"CN-13686" `	"Captain <last>!" he calls out, audible even over the chaos. He strides up to you quickly and then pulls you aside to a sheltered spot. "Thank the cosmos you're here. I don't know what the devil is going on, either out there or in here, but it's absolute madness."`
	"CN-13687" `	Before you can get a word in he's powered on.`
	"CN-13688" `	"Look at this!" He thrusts a stack of pages at you, pointing to some text that's too small to read while he keeps moving it. "Somehow there's now three alien races involved in this plot, and two are transparently Quarg and Korath. People aren't even meant to know about the Korath!"`
	"CN-13689" `	"Turner, I'm here on urgent business."`
	"CN-13690" `	"Know about who?"`
	"CN-13691" `	He ignores you and continues, "There's philosopher kings involved, and they go off to some ringworld that someone's made up just to work out how to track something through hyperspace! Have you ever heard of anything so ridiculous? This whole plot device wasn't explained until today, and now we've got two thirds of the scenes shot and a script that needs massive rewrites!`
	"CN-13692" `	"I mean look at this, look!" He flips to another page with a section circled in red. He takes it back reads aloud, "The two come close and look into each other's eyes for a moment before kissing. Stage Note: Produce different models to focus group the aesthetic look of open-mouth kissing when both participants have finger-length incisors."`
	"CN-13693" `	He gesticulates, apparently at a loss for words. "Who even wrote this? Who writes this stuff? Why would you even put that in there?"`
	"CN-13694" `	"Sorry, you were presumably here on business, what's going on out there?"`
	"CN-13695" `	"The Hai have closed their borders and may shoot anyone trying to pass through the wormhole."`
	"CN-13696" `	"The Hai are having an election, and Sayari is expecting political chaos. Is everyone here okay?"`
	"CN-13697" `	"They're having a what?" He listens incredulously as you explain the situation with pirate slavers, the Unfettered support, the public shaming and the snap election.`
	"CN-13698" `	"We suspected that, we haven't been game to test, but why?" He listens incredulously as you explain the situation with pirate slavers, the Unfettered support, the public shaming and the snap election.`
	"CN-13699" `	When you finish on the possibility of an Unfettered war fleet appearing at the wormhole to scour pirate worlds, he stops you with a pained expression. "Well, it's all falling apart, isn't it... Alright, look, this is above my pay-grade, and I don't think within Terry's either. You need to go contact Admiral Danforth. The connection from here to Farpoint is excellent now, since all our other traffic is routing through those new relays, so it should be easy enough. I'll make sure no one does anything stupid from this side. I'm sure there's a solution here, we all just need to keep our heads and call the right people."`
	"CN-13700" `	"I'll go to my ship's comms now and call him."`
	"CN-13701" `	From back on your ship it is easy enough to use the station's network to place a call. You get in contact with Danforth to brief him on what's going on, with the possibility of an Unfettered fleet coming through the wormhole in a matter of days. He seems unsurprised, but disappointed. "Well, I'll scramble some additional Navy forces. We'll hopefully make sure that whatever happens, we'll have some options."`
	"CN-13702" `	You can hear him grimace on the call. "When this went on as long as it did, I pulled strings to get some Cruisers specially equipped for deep-range, long-duration missions." He sighs. "This is one of those situations where I really wish I hadn't prepared for an eventuality and been right about it.`
	"CN-13703" `	"I'll be there with a fleet soon. In the meantime, you need to go back to <planet> to ensure the safety of the diplomatic corps. Get them out if need be, otherwise just be there with a ship so you can monitor the situation."`
	"CN-13704" `You are granted access to the secure spaceport, potentially because nobody has filed any paperwork to stop you, and you can't help but notice that the strangely-outfitted Centipede from Teeneep's operations on Darkwaste has made its way here as well. It is late in the day when you enter the diplomatic wing of the government complex. The developing gloom as Ya Hai sinks behind the buildings of the capital underscores the mood; the place appears nearly deserted.`
	"CN-13705" `	Fortunately though, you swiftly discover Alondo and Remington who are sitting in the empty cafeteria with paired glasses of what appears to be scotch whiskey. When he sees you Alondo raises a hand and gestures for you to sit with them. "<first>! Bloody hell, come join us."`
	"CN-13706" `	"Are you all ok?"`
	"CN-13707" `	"How long have you been here?"`
	"CN-13708" `	Remington shifts his weight and determinedly pushes his wrist across his chest until his jacket sleeve pushes up far enough for him to look at his watch. After a lengthy pause spent staring at it's screen he screws up his face, finishes his drink, and says, "At least two hours too long."`
	"CN-13709" `	Alondo grimaces, raises his eyebrows, and gives a lopsided shrug which altogether does a remarkable job of conveying the sentiment: "so far it looks like it, but I still need at least one more stiff drink to get over it." Remington looks at him and chuckles halfheartedly before emptying his glass and putting it down with a sharp clink. "We weren't sure for a while there, but other than being cut off, we're okay."`
	"CN-13710" `	Alondo gestures at the large, wall-mounted monitor they've been watching, and you realize that it must be displaying some kind of post-election coverage. The writing is all in Hai, but it seems that the majority of the information that would matter to the diplomats has been displayed visually. On its own you'd have never guessed at trying to read Teeneep's name written in Hai, but when it's presented next to her face and then shown on a pie chart next to percentages and other graphics, it becomes easy enough to follow what's happening.`
	"CN-13711" `	"Who won the election?"`
	"CN-13712" `	"Can either of you explain all of this?"`
	"CN-13713" `	"Every so often they have a segment in something we can understand, presumably because of the rest of us out there," says Remington, gesturing vaguely beyond the walls to the outside. "You wouldn't believe some of the rhetoric the last few days while you've been gone."`
	"CN-13714" `	Alondo visibly shudders, and pushes the bottle across the table back to Remington. "Sometimes it was like watching the old documentaries and political dramas I studied back at school. The ones where there's some populist extremist with dangerous ideas that the establishment is just blindly assuming couldn't possibly be successful, while at the same time that same populist is whipping crowds into a violent frenzy on the streets outside."`
	"CN-13715" `	On the screen the face of a charming-looking male Hai comes up and Alondo points with sudden vigor. "Him! I swear there was going to be torches and pitchforks right below my window one night thanks to him. He's here on Hai-home, as are his followers."`
	"CN-13716" `	You are relieved to see that when it flicks over to the stats, the individual in question looks to be losing out on whatever his target was by a nice, comfortable, seven percentage points.`
	"CN-13717" `	Remington nods sagely and an unreadable expression flicks between them for a moment before he looks back at you. "The Hai electoral system seems quite simple on the surface, but they seem to have a complex series of reserve steps and fail-safes for if any outcomes aren't clear enough for their thresholds. For almost all of yesterday I couldn't even find a Hai in this very building who could translate what was going on well enough to make sense of it.`
	"CN-13718" `	"They only started locking in the last few seats a couple of hours ago. Until then we could have been prisoners and at war by now for all we knew. Peace-oriented heads seem to have prevailed though, but there's no lack of passion even in them. Near as I can tell from what has been explained and what I'm seeing; a third of the Elders have been replaced, which is the fastest change they've had since they were invaded by Korath... which I also didn't know was a thing that had happened until yesterday."`
	"CN-13719" `	He manages to make that last line sound both bewildered and grumpy at the same time. "That Teeneep you've been running around with - and yes, don't look at me in shock, Sayari told me when we were concerned you might not get out. You've developed some friends in high places and I admire that... where was I?"`
	"CN-13720" `	"Teeneep!" says Alondo, perhaps a little too loudly, nearly poking Remington in the face.`
	"CN-13721" `	"Of course, that Teeneep of yours, she had her position settled yesterday. She's being..." He curls his lip and frowns while looking for the right word. "Inaugurated! She's being inaugurated in about an hour or so. It's why we're still here. She's the youngest 'elder' since before we developed fire, or some similarly ridiculous time-frame. She seems to have the most influence among the new lot, at least now that 'sir pitchforks and Pulse Rifles' down there has definitively lost. She's a firebrand, that one, but she seems principled and decent. We're waiting to hear what she has to say in her victory speech."`
	"CN-13722" `	Remington answers your question. "That Teeneep of yours, she had her position settled yesterday. She's being..." He curls his lip and frowns while looking for the right word. "Inaugurated! She's being inaugurated in about an hour or so. It's why we're still here. She's the youngest 'elder' since before we developed fire, or some similarly ridiculous time-frame. She seems to have the most influence among the new lot. She's a firebrand, that one, but she seems principled and decent. We're waiting to hear what she has to say in her victory speech."`
	"CN-13723" `	Alondo wobbles over to the bar and says, "I'll get you a drink, <last>. What'll you have?"`
	"CN-13724" `	"Just a water for me, thanks."`
	"CN-13725" `	"It's time for some celebratory beer. I'll have the best ale!"`
	"CN-13726" `	"I'll need some 'medicine' to get through this horror. Anything at least 80 proof should do."`
	"CN-13727" `	After a few more drinks, Teeneep's speech comes on. Either it's all in Hai, or you drank more than you thought. The speech is short and punchy, but restrained; or at least her delivery of it has that feeling. With nothing else to do, and it being well into the evening, you call it a night.`
	"CN-13728" `	As it turns out, Teeneep's speech is in Hai with no translation available. It's short and punchy, but restrained; or at least her delivery of it has that feeling. With nothing else to do, and it being well into the evening, you call it a night.`
	"CN-13729" `	The following morning Sayari finds you with Alondo, Remington, Xilin and Batu all having vending machine breakfasts in the cafeteria. It turns out Hai vending machines aren't half bad.`
	"CN-13730" `	"Morning to all of you." She seems a little stiff compared to normal. "I'm glad you're all here together, it'll save me some time. Now, I have good news and bad news. I believe it's polite to ask which do you want first?"`
	"CN-13731" `	Alondo and Remington both groan, neither having pulled up particularly well this morning. Xilin has a great deal more composure but looks like he's not had a break from stress in well over a month... which is probably accurate. "Why don't you pick, <last>?" he says.`
	"CN-13732" `	"Good news."`
	"CN-13733" `	"Bad news."`
	"CN-13734" `	"Well, the bad news is that I'm afraid you're all going somewhere. You have an hour to collect your things and be ready to go. We are going to rendezvous with a fleet."`
	"CN-13735" `	That seems to make people sit up a bit straighter and Alondo seems to unconsciously stabilize himself against Remington's shoulder. "The good news is that we're probably not going to be getting into a fight. The new Elder council has somewhat more, uh, flexibility than the previous one."`
	"CN-13736" `	"Well, the good news is that we're probably not going to be getting into a fight with the Republic. Peaceful voices for change triumphed over more radical instigators. The new Elder council has somewhat more, uh, flexibility than the previous one."`
	"CN-13737" `	Xilin actively seems to draw strength from this news, and Remington claps Alondo on the shoulder with a quiet, "told ya." Sayari continues. "The bad news is that I'm afraid you're all going somewhere. You have an hour to collect your things and be ready to go. We have a fleet to meet and there's more work ahead of us."`
	"CN-13738" `	The freshest of the group, Batu, seems to twig to something first. "There's going to be an ultimatum, isn't there? The fleet is a threat."`
	"CN-13739" `	"Yes," says Sayari. "It's going to be a very broad ultimatum though, with lots of room for the Republic to decide how it's addressed; and no one is shooting at anyone without talking first. Now, all of you except <last> are traveling with Elder Teeneep. I suggest you go and prepare immediately."`
	"CN-13740" `	As the meeting disperses, Sayari motions for you. She leads you away to have a private discussion.`
	"CN-13741" `	"What has Teeneep done, Sayari?"`
	"CN-13742" `	"I take it you need another ride?"`
	"CN-13743" `	She puts her paw over her face and breathes a long sigh. "Yes, Captain <last>, I do need another ride." She smiles sadly and looks away for a moment.`
	"CN-13744" `	Her tone is very serious as she explains, "Things might be tense now, but I promise, things aren't as bad as they look. I know Teeneep, and she has the influential backing of another long-time advocate for sensible change, who was also just elected. They are remaining here to reinforce her position. Teeneep displaced that Elder who threatened her in the chambers. It's upset all the long-term power dynamics in the Council, but it's a much better Council overall now.`
	"CN-13745" `	"Events are in motion though, we're to go directly to <stopovers> and then to <planet> - and you're to come with us too. I don't think it's something they view as optional, and I'm told I'm required to travel with you... as insurance."`
	"CN-13746" `She hesitates, seeming oddly nervous for the one who theoretically has all the power in the room. "<last>, this will sound silly, but I'm a bit of a traditionalist sometimes. There's a superstition about space travel, and under the circumstances... I'm too old for this stress. Could you please do me a favor and make sure you have a Quantum Keystone on your ship? It's meant to be good luck, and well, I think we need it."`
	"CN-13747" `	Her expression is deeply wounded, but she sets her resolve. "Then this is no longer a request. It's a requirement.`
	"CN-13748" `	She looks relieved. "Thank you, I really appreciate it.`
	"CN-13749" `	"I'll be along in a bit, I need to go and collect my things for traveling now too."`
	"CN-13750" `Upon docking at <origin>, now bereft of civilians, you and Sayari are kept out of things for a little while, as some business occurs behind a Navy security barricade in the direction of where Teeneep's ship docked. Neither Terry nor Turner are allowed through either, as Navy personnel progressively establish operations and set secure areas on the station. Eventually Batu is sent out to get all of you and escort you in.`
	"CN-13751" `	As you reach Xilin, who is also joined by other diplomats and even Danforth, Sayari is intercepted by a Hai functionary and led away. Xilin looks at you all with a grave face and begins. "So. The Hai have broadcast the threat that if the Republic does not treat with them seriously, the united Hai will move in without Republic approval to search for their people. We're at a political impasse now, as the Cabinet is blocking any progress.`
	"CN-13752" `	"The Hai have demanded we cut through the red tape by having the heads of state meet." He turns to you briefly. "They insist on you as a mediator. I think behind-the-scenes discussions have reached the point where we can proceed, and we've gathered to prepare you for the meeting."`
	"CN-13753" `	"What if we solve the kidnapping problem instead of the Hai doing it?"`
	"CN-13754" `	"What if we let them through, to attack the pirate planets?"`
	"CN-13755" `	"Who in the Cabinet is blocking progress?"`
	"CN-13756" `	"Can the Hai really pass through, with the Republic Navy blocking their way?"`
	"CN-13757" `	"I'm ready to mediate. Let's assemble the heads of state."`
	"CN-13758" `	Xilin responds, "The Navy has blockaded the wormhole to the best of its ability, but the reality is that the Navy is already heavily committed, and barely look to be a match for the Hai fleet numbers. The Hai, on the other hand, do not yet appear to be committed heavily." He looks at Alondo briefly. "We had the unstated privilege of observing the Hai security fleet left behind on Everhope in addition to what we saw beyond the wormhole on our way in."`
	"CN-13759" `	Danforth interjects, "In short, we doubt we can stop them while we're stretched out here... and if the reality is that they're only going to go after pirate worlds... well, we'd be under orders to disengage. The political crisis would be more tolerable than the probable military defeat."`
	"CN-13760" `	Xilin nods grimly. "However, that would be a drastic failure of foreign policy."`
	"CN-13761" `	Xilin replies, "That would undermine the legitimacy of the Republic, especially after the war we've just had, and it would be impossible to realistically assure people that an invasion is really not going to happen. True or not. In all likelihood the Republic would fracture and the Free Worlds would probably be on the receiving end of a migration crisis. Parliament has tried to say that they'll take care of it themselves, but the Hai say they've had enough of sitting around and want to be there to save their own people."`
	"CN-13762" `	Xilin says, "They haven't outright said it... but they've implied that the Navy could end up killing the Hai involved in the process by not understanding the capabilities of the Hai, or by placing too great an emphasis on preserving Navy lives. The Cabinet is in disagreement about what to do, so there is deadlock at the moment."`
	"CN-13763" `	Xilin proceeds to list off a number of names, but to everyone's irritation and surprise, Turner cuts in. "Remington, I know you're the PR guy, and you keep your nose out of sales, so I apologize if it's presumptuous for me to assume you haven't considered this, but most of those names are people who listen to the Syndicate. I should know, I've had to negotiate with them as a bloc often enough for government contracts. Has anyone on your side reported back to the Syndicate Board and suggested that, perhaps, if we can influence them to support a solution that we propose; even if we don't have that solution defined yet; the Hai could be a very large and very profitable market for Syndicate goods?"`
	"CN-13764" `	There is a long, expectant pause as Remington looks to Terry and they engage in some kind of silent exchange before he replies. "You know, I don't think we'd connected those two specific dots just yet." He looks at Terry. "We need to make some calls."`
	"CN-13765" `	A few hours later, they manage to set up a clear channel dedicated to the meeting in a room with large wall-mounted displays. Xilin and Alondo are standing near you, slightly off camera. Alondo explains, "We've arranged a high-reliability feed directly to the President of the Republic and the Chancellor of the Free Worlds. You'll see them here soon, along with Teeneep and Sayari from another room in the station."`
	"CN-13766" `	Soon after, the leaders all appear. You knew the moment was coming but you're still a little surprised to see the President and Chancellor in remarkable clarity and surprisingly low latency. The windows behind the Chancellor suggest they were awoken in the middle of the night for this, but you wouldn't guess it from looking at them.`
	"CN-13767" `	Xilin whispers to you, "Teeneep wants you to mediate, so you need to begin the proceedings. Ask her to present the problem."`
	"CN-13768" `	"Would the Hai representative please present us the problem we must solve together?"`
	"CN-13769" `	"Teeneep, please explain the problem to the human leaders. I'm sure we can come to a compromise that will suit everyone."`
	"CN-13770" `	Teeneep responds, "Thank you for mediating these proceedings, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-13771" `	Teeneep explains, "I speak as the voice of the Hai and with the full authority of the Elder Council. Thousands of our people have been kidnapped over the past few decades, and they still largely reside under the servitude of various pirate factions that the Republic allows to continue. Even worse, your authorities have allowed numerous Hai to be slipped past on slaver ships, without attempting rescue because of the no boarding policy your forces employ, even on disabled and potentially doomed ships. We demand the return of our people and an immediate end to the policy of letting slaves die or escape without attempting boarding and rescue."`
	"CN-13772" `	The President is the first to respond. "The problem of piracy in human space is a difficult one and cannot be solved overnight. The pirates are well-entrenched in their planets, and fighting them is a long and brutal struggle. With our navies distracted fighting one another, our recent war has left them stronger than ever."`
	"CN-13773" `	The Chancellor states, "However, the Free Worlds have made great strides reducing piracy by befriending the peoples of the anarchist worlds. We are discussing similar approaches with the Republic. Perhaps in another few years, piracy will be entirely eliminated."`
	"CN-13774" `	Xilin whispers to you again, "The problem is of immediate concern, and the Hai will not view this as an acceptable proposal. They need to respond."`
	"CN-13775" `	"Is this an acceptable proposal, Teeneep?"`
	"CN-13776" `	"With respect, Chancellor, this is a problem of immediate concern. I'm sure the Hai representative would like to respond to that before we continue."`
	"CN-13777" `	Teeneep looks perturbed, and has to make an effort to hold back her anger and resentment. The other heads of state don't seem to notice; perhaps you're more sensitive to Hai facial expressions after the time you have spent with them. "Of course not," she says.`
	"CN-13778" `	Teeneep responds plainly, "We are a peaceful people by nature, but these pirate attacks have gone too far. We support a solution that benefits the innocent inhabitants of the pirate worlds. However, there must be immediate action, not years of delay."`
	"CN-13779" `	Xilin whispers to you, "Ask politely for a counter-proposal."`
	"CN-13780" `	"Are there any counter-proposals?"`
	"CN-13781" `	"Surely a group of enlightened human leaders can propose an alternative?"`
	"CN-13782" `	The President presents a stony mask at being patronized, but the Chancellor smirks. You get a furry little smile from Teeneep.`
	"CN-13783" `	"We have a counter-proposal," the President says. "We cannot afford to change our policy in totality, it would cost too many lives. However, we propose the following: the Free Worlds and Republic will establish a customs service on Mountaintop. Hai visiting human space will check in with us there. Our intelligence agencies will then track their movements in order to see to their safety as best we can. They'll also be given contacts on every human planet that they can go to for help. In the meantime, we will place extensive surveillance fleets at Ultima Thule to detect any unapproved Hai travel. We will do our best to disable and capture ships with kidnapped Hai, no matter the risk to Navy lives."`
	"CN-13784" `	"The Free Worlds will also extend our protection, of course," the Chancellor adds.`
	"CN-13785" `	Teeneep looks relieved by this suggestion.`
	"CN-13786" `	Xilin whispers to you, "This is the solution everyone already discussed behind the scenes on the human side. You need to confirm the Hai will accept it."`
	"CN-13787" `	"Would that be acceptable, Elder Teeneep?"`
	"CN-13788" `	"Teeneep, will that satisfy the Hai?"`
	"CN-13789" `	Teeneep takes a moment to respond. "That sounds like an acceptable future state... but I cannot sign any treaty yet. The Hai will not be satisfied until our kidnapped brethren are returned."`
	"CN-13790" `	The President replies, "The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been keeping the Cabinet apprised of the major details and proposals reported back by Deputy Minister Yang. Under the circumstances we believe it would be appropriate for us to attempt a joint effort to address your concerns. We agree to making this effort against one target, and to reassessing the situation afterwards depending upon what is discovered in that process. The Republic representatives there with you now will work with you to identify that target and plan the action accordingly."`
	"CN-13791" `	The smoothness with which this goes down gives you the sense that the main points of this were all provisionally agreed to already, with only a little wiggle room left to be settled in this conversation.`
	"CN-13792" `	Sayari steps up and whispers something to Teeneep who then seems to think for a moment before returning to the screens. "This pathway is acceptable."`
	"CN-13793" `	Xilin whispers to you, "The functionaries are waiting for your signal to end the call so we can implement the decision. And, of course, so the Chancellor can get some sleep."`
	"CN-13794" `	"That ends these proceedings."`
	"CN-13795" `	"Thank you, President, Chancellor, and Hai representative."`
	"CN-13796" `	The President and Chancellor nod mechanically while Teeneep perks her ears and tilts her head in a motion that usually signals pride.`
	"CN-13797" `	After the screens go off, a number of people involved in the busywork of bureaucracy start slipping out of the room, doubtlessly to get a head start on certain preparations, as Teeneep and the leaders on the screen conclude some formal thanks for continued cooperation and other matters of protocol. You are too visible to slip away though and have to wait.`
	"CN-13798" `	When you finally emerge Terry and Turner are waiting for you. Terry addresses you. "Captain <last>. We have a little problem. The many civilians that have been living under this cover or being serviced by it have been kept in the dark, and are very nervous about the massed Navy ships. They've been so far sold a story about a 'pirate menace,' and now we need them out of here."`
	"CN-13799" `	Turner smiles, "And I think it would be appropriate if you, as the famous war hero, were the one to escort them to safety and keep everyone's eyes away from what's happening here."`
	"CN-13800" `	The two of them look at each other for a second before Terry says, "We also need to get out of here ourselves. With the movie cover shutting down, we both have other things we really should be doing, and so we'd like to come with you. It would be much safer on your ship than with any of the merchant ships that need escorting."`
	"CN-13801" `A message comes through just as you arrive at Mirfak, and it's from Teeneep.`
	"CN-13802" `	It reads: "While this situation is ongoing with Choot'k here away from his people, you should not go near the Unfettered. It will likely be seen as duplicitous, which would be a disaster."`
	"CN-13803" `Arriving on Sunracer, the entire port seems to be abuzz with the news. It has not gone unnoticed that the Navy moved a large fleet into the uninhabited systems in the northern corridor between Syndicate space and the Far North. Now, it seems that blockades are going up in Rigel, Nihal, Mirfak & Zaurak using Navy or Syndicate security vessels depending on jurisdiction. The theories are flying thick and fast, but everyone seems to agree on one thing; there is some sort of major crisis happening.`
	"CN-13804" `Your communicator beeps and you realize you have received a message from Remington. There's a Captain of one of their security detachments waiting to meet you in the spaceport. Apparently there have been developments while you were in flight. Now might be the last opportunity to sort anything else out for a little while.`
	"CN-13805" `The Syndicate security captain in the spaceport is very easy to find. She hands you a pad with a secure validation sequence to confirm her briefing comes from the Navy, co-signed by Xilin.`
	"CN-13806" `	She appears to have a posse of other captains with her who conveniently enforce a bubble of privacy around you just by taking up space. "So," she says. "The Republic has agreed to accompany the Hai to precisely one world. Combined intelligence indicates that <planet> is the most likely place for any kidnapped Hai to be, assuming they exist. The blockades that have gone up are to secure this area of space against the secret of this exercise... or at least try to.`
	"CN-13807" `	"There's going to be a battle, and you have a critical role entrusted to you for coordinating the fleet. There can be no detours. Once we start moving it will be one jump to the rendezvous and then two to our target. Are you ready for it?"`
	"CN-13808" `	"I'm ready now."`
	"CN-13809" `	"I need time to prepare."`
	"CN-13810" `	"Very good." So far she hasn't introduced herself, but as she puts the pad away her flight jacket moves enough for you to see 'Captain Valeria Estrada' printed on the jumpsuit underneath. "Now, to bring you up to speed: at least two pirate groups on <planet> have been involved in smuggling or kidnappings. <planet> is a fortress of anonymity and discretion, as well as being a literal fortress. An agreed upon force of overwhelming numbers has been prepared at Mountaintop. The objective is to overwhelm the defenders, prevent any escapes, and occupy the planet while they ferret out all the groups intelligence has flagged.`
	"CN-13811" `	"The Navy, Unfettered, and Hai fleets will travel from Mountaintop to meet you. We must fly with all haste to <waypoints> to meet them, where you will lead the fleet and coordinate the attack. My security force will follow, but until we get to Sumar don't worry about waiting for us. We'll handle ourselves. Once we're all together in Sumar, your job will be to make sure everyone moves as one for each jump from there to <system>."`
	"CN-13812" `	She lowers her voice even further, despite the privacy afforded already. "There will be two Navy Carrier groups, our full Syndicate Special Security Detachment, the Unfettered Expeditionary Fleet, and a full Hai Taskforce. I haven't heard of a fleet this large in one place since the Alpha Wars. This coordination role is not a joke. There's lots of scope for things to go wrong. We will go in, clean up, and search for Hai. Parliament will reassess the scope of concern later, depending on what we find down there. We follow your lead, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-13813" `	She nods. "Very well, but don't take too long. We'll be waiting here for as long as we're able."`
	"CN-13814" `When the Hai and humans try to deploy troops, they're drawn off by orbital bombardment. You must defeat the entire pirate and marauder defense fleet before landing.`
	"CN-13815" `While you join the fleet that lands to occupy the spaceport, other assault ships pursue priority targets elsewhere on <origin>. There's a significant wait to ensure that ground troops have secured the port before everyone can reconvene to discuss the next steps.`
	"CN-13816" `	You eventually reach the secured command area set up in the spaceport as Choot'k and Danforth come in discussing tactical minutiae. They are trailed by Batu, and eventually joined by Sayari and Teeneep. One of Danforth's lieutenants brings up the rear and closes the door behind you all.`
	"CN-13817" `	There is a moment of uncertainty where Danforth continues conversing in a low voice with his lieutenant and Batu catches your gaze with a questioning look.`
	"CN-13818" `	"Admiral, would you like to lead this?"`
	"CN-13819" `	"Good to see everyone arrive here safely."`
	"CN-13820" `	Everyone is waiting for you to speak. It seems this is your final briefing as the commander of the forces before diplomats and military leaders take over.`
	"CN-13821" `	"What is the status of the <origin> operation?"`
	"CN-13822" `	"Is the Hai disinformation campaign still working?"`
	"CN-13823" `	"Sayari and Teeneep, what are your plans?"`
	"CN-13824" `	"I'm honored to have served you as fleet commander."`
	"CN-13825" `	"Excellent work, everyone! Carry on!"`
	"CN-13826" `	Danforth begins the report. "Stage one has been successful. However, as I expected, it looks like we're going to be here a while. <origin> is a rabbit warren of hidden places. Even with the Hai resources on top of everything we've brought, it could take weeks to root things out sufficiently."`
	"CN-13827" `	"General Choot'k, would you agree with the human's assessment of the effort required here?" asks Teeneep.`
	"CN-13828" `	The Unfettered warlord does not even hesitate to respond, "Yes. Even with our superior capacities we will be here a while."`
	"CN-13829" `	Batu clears his throat and Danforth glances at him before evidently remembering something discussed earlier. "I'm sorry, Captain <last> and Elder Teeneep. I must advise you that at this stage all hope of keeping the Hai a secret is lost. Even if we could convince all factions to keep the secret, the blockade has drawn too much attention, so all that remains is to resolve the matters at hand before the Hai become irretrievably common knowledge."`
	"CN-13830" `	Teeneep responds, "We all knew that day would come soon. Be glad we're here together to usher it in peacefully and with strength."`
	"CN-13831" `	"Our place is here, Captain <last>," says Teeneep, definitively.`
	"CN-13832" `	Danforth looks between them. "Perhaps, Elder, you and the Ambassador would find it more comfortable to return to Mountaintop? There will be little diplomacy here, and scarcely more safety, and it would seem to me that, even with Batu here as the Deputy Minister's eyes on the ground, it would be easier to conduct your responsibilities directly."`
	"CN-13833" `	Teeneep seems to bristle but Sayari smoothly cuts in. "You should not concern yourself with our comfort, Admiral. It would not be seemly for the Elder to abandon the field while another leader remains." She looks pointedly at Choot'k. "You may have forgotten also but there are Hai representatives of two governments in this room. It would also be unseemly for our ships to act in concert with the Unfettered without a diplomatic liaison here. And so I too have my place here. Things have happened quickly, of course, but my colleague Hiyamaharu will soon arrive at Mountaintop to act as my counterpart there. I trust things are being attended to, but you might consider checking that your people are properly aware of that."`
	"CN-13834" `	Danforth looks around and, without missing a beat, steps up to the table in the middle of the room. "Thank you, Captain. The Hai and Unfettered are coordinating through me and my command for the ground operation, and so far, stage one has been successful. However, as I expected, it looks like we're going to be here a while. <origin> is a labyrinth of hidden places. Even with the Hai resources on top of everything we've brought, it could take weeks to root things out sufficiently."`
	"CN-13835" `	Batu clears his throat and Danforth glances at him before evidently remembering something discussed earlier. "I'm sorry, Captain <last> and Elder Teeneep. After the assault our situation has been reassessed and I must advise you that we no longer consider it feasible to maintain the secrecy of the Hai. Even if we could convince all factions to keep the secret, the blockade has drawn too much attention, so all that remains is to resolve the matters at hand before the Hai become irretrievably common knowledge."`
	"CN-13836" `	Danforth looks between Sayari and Teeneep speculatively, as if considering something for the first time. "Perhaps, Elder, you and the Ambassador would find it more comfortable to return to Mountaintop? There will be little diplomacy here, and scarcely more safety, and it would seem to me that, even with Batu here as the Deputy Minister's eyes on the ground, it would be easier to conduct your responsibilities directly."`
	"CN-13837" `	Danforth nods in acknowledgment and turns back to you. "Captain, you may consider your fleet command duties to be complete now that we're on the ground. You did a good job, and we'll take it back from here."`
	"CN-13838" `	"I'm honored to have served you as temporary fleet commander."`
	"CN-13839" `	"I did no more than I would expect anyone else to have done."`
	"CN-13840" `	"All in a day's work! Excellent work, everyone! Carry on!"`
	"CN-13841" `	Everyone looks surprised or offended, as if you are the court jester who thought he was king. They're dismissive of your comment, as they begin to discuss your departure.`
	"CN-13842" `	Danforth suppresses a smile, while Batu expresses his openly. General Choot'k says, "You've surpassed my expectations, Captain <last>. I've never seen a fleet so large, but you led it to victory with the speed and skill of a veteran general."`
	"CN-13843" `	The leaders all look pleased. General Choot'k says, "You've surpassed my expectations, Captain <last>. I've never seen a fleet so large, but you led it to victory with the speed and skill of a veteran general." Danforth looks just as impressed.`
	"CN-13844" `	Danforth explains, "For now, all communication in and out of the area is blocked at the relay unless it is to or from specific high-level Navy or Syndicate sources. Captain <last>, I'm afraid that also includes you. We don't have time or equipment to harden your systems against potential intrusion, but you do have the nearly exclusive freedom to pass through the blockade. You're a pilot, not a ground combat troop operator, so you should pursue other matters."`
	"CN-13845" `	On your way out Sayari catches you. "Let's meet aboard Teeneep's ship. We have sensitive matters to discuss." You follow her to the ship.`
	"CN-13846" `	"What is it, Sayari?"`
	"CN-13847" `	"Do you have more leads on the smuggling operation?"`
	"CN-13848" `	"Yes, of course, but there's something you need to know about.`
	"CN-13849" `	"I have some leads on the smuggling operation, but there's something else you'll want to know about, too.`
	"CN-13850" `	"Certain people have noticed that you have had close interactions with Teeneep and I through this, and people have asked whether you are responsible for the mess caused by Teeneep going public with information you helped her find." Her expression is very serious. "We have not told them every detail, but we made it clear to your diplomats that the issue was a matter which would have blocked any solution until it was resolved, whether you helped or not. They understand that your involvement has helped moving towards a solution, even if parts of it could be misconstrued when seen from the outside."`
	"CN-13851" `	Sayari turns to her console and brings up a map. "Now on to the smuggling leads. These are the suspected routes used to justify the <origin> operation. Unfortunately, while many matches were found, there was nothing in the new data that conclusively linked to the mysterious symbol. No human escapees had been tested for mild cadmium poisoning, so that was a dead end too. I know it's been thrust into the background pretty heavily, but did you find anything yourself? We need to decide if we're setting this aside or not."`
	"CN-13852" `	"I've met a researcher named Giti who has been quite informative."`
	"CN-13853" `	"I need to leave the communication blackout to check."`
	"CN-13854" `	Sayari responds. "Yes, of course.`
	"CN-13855" `	You relate to her your meetings with Giti and the evidence she gathered.`
	"CN-13856" `	"If you haven't heard from her in a while," Sayari says, "then perhaps she has more information by now?`
	"CN-13857" `	"Please, while we have some time. Follow up that thread and then return. At this point if it proves to be a fruitless search then so be it, but I insist on having no loose ends we haven't tried our best to follow to conclusion. If you come back and that's the end, I'll bring Teeneep around."`
	"CN-13858" `	Recalling the star charts, you remember that <destination> is the nearest planet outside the communications blackout zone.`
	"CN-13859" `Once safely parked and hooked into the relay network from Canyon you check timezones and place a call to Giti. Astonishingly, you manage to get a remarkably clean connection and don't have to leave a message. Perhaps by fluke it's night in all the most populous places between here and there. She's at her desk when she answers, and it occurs to you for the first time that a research console on a Navy grade connection probably has pretty good bandwidth. "Oh, it's a relief to see you, Captain. There's been so much going on, I feared you'd been caught up and detained with all that blockade stuff that all over the news right now. You're lucky though, it's quite late here and I was just about to pack up."`
	"CN-13860" `	"I was a little caught up, actually."`
	"CN-13861" `	"What do you know about the blockades?"`
	"CN-13862" `	As you draw breath to speak she cuts you off. "I actually don't have a lot of time or I'll miss my ride, so we'll skip the pleasantries. Obviously if you're calling me back you want to know what I found about the notation. That too is something you have good timing on, I was delayed on that until just a couple days ago. Now where was that file... ah, here it is.`
	"CN-13863" `	"So, the notation is actually quite dense which makes perfect translation an uncertain prospect. The first part is some meaningless prose about something called 'Elenchus,' which sounds aspirational. I have its location, in a system called Devil-Hide, far outside of our galaxy to the north-west. The second part contains a riddle, which gives the location of another system, Devil-Run, somewhere near the galactic core. I won't know the exact location until I solve the riddle: 'Where does the soul sleep?'"`
	"CN-13864" `	"What is Elenchus?"`
	"CN-13865" `	"Why aren't these systems on our star maps?"`
	"CN-13866" `	Giti ignores your question and continues. "While I work on the riddle, you're going to follow another lead. I found an online community who seem to be a support group for people who've had family members kidnapped. The missing person reports for some of them are suspiciously close matches or share features with those in the files you left for me. I came across a man who might, just maybe, know something useful. He claims to have found something odd related to cases in the set in your data, and one of the cases in your set is the disappearance of his wife, which is where his motivation comes from.`
	"CN-13867" `	"His theory is... well, it's a bit crackpot for the local authorities. I wouldn't have believed it either, were it not for the vastly superior swathe of information we now have at our disposal, but it might be what you need. I think you should go seek him out on <planet>."`
	"CN-13868" `	"Can you tell me more about the victim support group?"`
	"CN-13869" `	"What is his theory?"`
	"CN-13870" `	(Give up on having any questions answered.)`
	"CN-13871" `	She rummages around and presses a data stick into her terminal. You immediately download it into a data stick of your own. "This has the information he gave me to follow him up. I convinced him to trust me, so hopefully he's receptive to you. It also has all the data that explicitly identifies all the ship IDs that are associated with our suspicious cases. That's the best I've got for you, though. If this doesn't pan out we'll need to go a different way.`
	"CN-13872" `	"In any event, I really must go. Follow that lead, and then come see me. Fly safe, Captain!"`
	"CN-13873" `Following Giti's directions you make your way to the communications research laboratory for Lovelace Labs in search of a man named Goraz Zoltof who works there. The brief contains an address and detailed information about the man, whose wife went missing under mysterious circumstances some time ago, though it's mostly information you've already been told. After a short commute by subway you reach his house and knock on the door.`
	"CN-13874" `	He's a little groggy, but manages to ask, "Yes?" You explain about the kidnappings and how your colleague thinks his theory is worth investigating. You avoid mentioning that some of the people are Hai, just in case he's never heard of them. He seems to awaken immediately. "You found a lead on my wife's disappearance? Wait, you're with 'BookWyrm23'?!" He turns and steps into a pair of slip-on shoes while grabbing a jacket. "Let's go to my laboratory at once! I can show you."`
	"CN-13875" `	"Sure." (Head to the laboratory.)`
	"CN-13876" `	"A lead of a sort."`
	"CN-13877" `	"Oh that's her handle?"`
	"CN-13878" `	He blinks at you. "I mean, I assume you're with the librarian?"`
	"CN-13879" `	"Research librarian," you clarify.`
	"CN-13880" `	"Exactly, come on, lets go." He quickly leads the way back to the tube.`
	"CN-13881" `	You clarify that technically it's a lead on cases that match the same profile as his wife's, not strictly his wife's case. His expression falters momentarily and then he seems to find some internal resolve to draw upon. "Good enough for me... Thank you, for your honesty."`
	"CN-13882" `	After a short return trip, you reach what looks like a small private spaceport. From the extra equipment and unusual ship designs, it must be a Lovelace Labs research center. Goraz's laboratory is an entire docking bay with a modified Bounder, but despite its size, it is conspicuously absent any other personnel. He takes you on board and, noting your attention to your surroundings, explains that he has a few assistants who are off-world most of the time.`
	"CN-13883" `	Goraz says, "Here, let me take a look at what you've brought me." He's eyeing your pockets.`
	"CN-13884" `	"It's all in this data stick."`
	"CN-13885" `	"I think this is what you've been looking for."`
	"CN-13886" `	Goraz takes the data stick you brought and plugs it into the communicator. After several minutes of mucking about with list formats and muttering incoherently to himself, a search result collates matches on his screen and he pauses. You're not sure exactly what you're looking at, but when it finishes he lets out a long slow breath and comments to himself in a low voice. "Bastijn Biesterveld, you absolute legend. He was right - it's the interference."`
	"CN-13887" `	He turns back to you and explains. "Normally interference isn't something that's logged, but when you're in civilized space with hyperspace relays, your ship does a final handshake with the local relay station as it jumps." He pauses briefly, maybe to see if you understand him.`
	"CN-13888" `	You see a long technical explanation coming on.`
	"CN-13889" `	"Skip the technical bits, please. Can you tell me what I need to do?"`
	"CN-13890" `	"I've helped with hyperspace relays recently, and I can never get enough lectures about hyperspace network issues. Please don't spare any details."`
	"CN-13891" `	He nods and begins his lecture. "The local relay station your ship contacts sends that handshake signature to the destination station so it knows exactly who you are to be able to reconnect communications at the other end. It's a fully automatic process, and it's independent of ship IDs. It's just buried in there as a check from back in the days when hyperdrives would occasionally explode and we'd need to work out who went missing. It gets logged and automatically overwritten every couple days, and someone would probably have gotten rid of it if it wasn't so deeply baked into the way the system works. If you know when a ship jumped and where it jumped to, you can use it to confirm it didn't blow up; and if there's something wrong with the communications equipment you can use the log info to identify if a specific ship is the same ship talking to you later, but neither of those are particularly useful since the same information can be acquired more easily and in much higher quality through other means.`
	"CN-13892" `	"There's a small group of us comms geeks that have lost people, or know people who have, that the authorities can't help. We're scattered all over and we've been looking at this ourselves. Together we identified some ships we thought were suspicious, but we've not been able to pin down anything concrete. Bastijn was convinced there was a pattern of interference signatures from the logs; he made the analysis program, but it was never definitively distinct from the noise. This data set you've brought, though. Well, once you filter for the subset of ships in our data set, what you've given me matches so completely to the set of ships we've found with interference that it has to be a match! Ninety-eight point five percent confidence interval completely annihilates the idea that it could be random."`
	"CN-13893" `	Goraz pauses for a moment, struggling to lower the content to layman's terms. "There's some ships that don't show up right on comms, which only a few experts like me can spot. Some of it could be random noise, but that's unlikely. We can filter out the subset of ships in our dataset. Hold on..."`
	"CN-13894" `	After a few moments of fiddling with terminals, he continues. "What you've given me matches so completely to the set of ships we've found with interference that it has to be a match! Ninety-eight point five percent confidence interval completely annihilates the idea that it could be random."`
	"CN-13895" `	He casts around for a moment and then plugs a freshly unpacked data card into his console. "Give me a little time: I can do something for you now. I'll be back with you in ten minutes."`
	"CN-13896" `	"Take your time."`
	"CN-13897" `	"I'll be here waiting."`
	"CN-13898" `	After some time, in which he looks like he's installing a series of programs, he returns your original data card and the second one. "Load this new card into one of your communicator's extra data storage slots, preferably the first one. This new card will run maintenance level processes with the communicator to download the logs from the local relay when you enter a system, match the log signatures for ships that are in-system, and code up extra info for their ID's. Functionally, they'll show up as 'Smuggler' on your display. You'll have to hunt for them though, cause you'll have to be in the same system as them for any of this to work."`
	"CN-13899" `	"That's some impressive work in such a short time."`
	"CN-13900" `	"Thank you for the help."`
	"CN-13901" `	He nods in response. "Also... maybe keep this quiet. This is," he pauses and clears his throat conspicuously, "somewhat less than strictly legal, though there's no penalty attached to accessing the data at the level this card will use. My data sets only cover coreward parts of Syndicate space, but your other data is heavily weighted to the Far North. Maybe if you have no luck in Syndicate space it'll be worth the trip to try up there."`
	"CN-13902" `	All business and technical explanation now out of the way, you watch as the reality of what's happening seems to suddenly sink in, and his demeanor changes suddenly as his eyes shine with faint hope, "And please, if you do find my wife Janitza... please bring her home."`
	"CN-13903" `	After one last ride through the metro system of <origin>, you arrive at your ship. You plug the data card into your computer, and a new "government" shows up: Smuggler. The ships will be colored differently than pirates.`
	"CN-13904" `	It may be risky, but you should disable one and board it.`
	"CN-13905" `As you maneuver to board this ship you send a message telling them that you know they're smugglers and demand their surrender. There is no response, but once you dock and open your side of the airlock, the door to the smuggler ship <origin> also opens partway and a Hai pokes their head through. The Hai's eyes are wide with fear but also determination as they shout at you through the docking tube.`
	"CN-13906" `	"Come on, you can do it! Just push a little harder!"`
	"CN-13907" `	"There should be an access panel above you! Maybe you can short-circuit the door?"`
	"CN-13908" `	The Hai says, "This door is jammed, they're locking down the ship and going to blow it up!" In the background you hear a booming sound. "It's 0.184 steradians! Tell them it's 0.184 steradians!"`
	"CN-13909" `	Inside your ship you hear alarms blare into full volume and you have just enough time to nod an acknowledgment to the doomed Hai before the airlock's automatic safeties shut it. A moment later, you hear an explosion and the sound of tearing metal as the docking tube is shredded and your ship is forced away from the expanding debris of the smuggler ship. When you return to the controls it seems the smugglers signaled for help before the ship exploded. An escape pod is flying away from the scene; apparently the smugglers care more about not being caught than about finishing their mission.`
	"CN-13910" `	This doesn't sound like an answer to the riddle, "Where does the soul sleep?" but it does sound like a hyperlane aperture size. Any interstellar pilot knows that a proper aperture size is critical to reaching the next star system in one piece, if only because having too much velocity will show an error on the console that reads 'Inadequate Steradian Approach Vector Certainty' when trying to jump. However, 0.184 is a highly unusual size, so this may be the information Giti needs. You begin to set a course for <planet>, but your scanners report multiple new contacts; hostile ships entering the system. You prepare for battle.`
	"CN-13911" `You scan this smuggling ship and notice only the basic crew are on board, along with all manner of illegal items. The ship begins to self-destruct and escape pods float away, just like before. As you wrap up, your computer informs you of incoming hostile ships.`
	"CN-13912" `As before, a doomed kidnapping victim screams to you about 0.184 steradians, but cannot escape before the smugglers set the self-destruct mechanism. While their escape pods float away, your ship detects incoming hostile vessels, and you prepare for battle.`
	"CN-13913" `A doomed kidnapping victim screams for help, and you try to rescue them. Before you reach the airlock, the smugglers set the self-destruct mechanism and depart in escape pods. Your ship detects incoming hostile vessels and you prepare for battle.`
	"CN-13914" `After a long series of shuttles, high-speed rails, and a several-minute-long elevator ride, you once again reach Giti's office.`
	"CN-13915" `	You enter the room and close the door. "Captain <last>! Welcome back. Please, come in. I've been working on that translation, and I've finally figured it out. The odd set of characters that looked like a riddle were actually a formula for calculating a jump target from the size of a hyperspace aperture, the origin, and a direction. I've managed the direction, and I could determine an origin if I had the aperture size."`
	"CN-13916" `	"Does '0.184 steradians' sound like the answer?"`
	"CN-13917" `	"My favorite number has always been 0.184."`
	"CN-13918" `	"Hmmm, 0.184 steradians? That'd be highly unusual; let me check." She fiddles with her datapad for a minute. "Yes, that produces an origin match. The system is in the middle of Syndicate-"`
	"CN-13919" `	There is a polite knock on the door and a click as someone opens it. Giti's initial expression is one of having been inconveniently interrupted by a colleague; swiftly transitioning to shock as three people in Republic Intelligence uniforms stride confidently into the room and take up positions. They each have a hand on their holstered weapons, but none make any move to draw them. A fourth person steps through afterwards with the poise of someone in absolute control of the situation.`
	"CN-13920" `	He gives both of you a brief, appraising look, then calmly shuts and locks the door.`
	"CN-13921" `	"This was a private conversation."`
	"CN-13922" `	(Draw my weapon.)`
	"CN-13923" `	"No, it wasn't." The man, whose Republic Intelligence uniform is labeled with the name "Agent Kopkow," gestures for you to take one of the only seats in the room. He takes the one opposite and Giti sits at her desk. The other three agents stand around you.`
	"CN-13924" `	The man, whose Republic Intelligence uniform is labeled with the name "Agent Kopkow," simply indicates the label with and then gestures for you to take one of the only seats in the room. He takes the one opposite and Giti sits at her desk. The other three agents stand around you.`
	"CN-13925" `	You've had some encounters with Republic Intelligence, but you know what everyone knows. They're the top police force of the Republic, dealing with high-profile civilian crimes that local authorities can't handle: murder investigations, interplanetary kidnappings, and the like. They also gather intelligence throughout human space, and possibly beyond, reporting directly to the Republic Parliament... which mostly means it's beholden to the interests of the members of Parliament.`
	"CN-13926" `	"I'm on an urgent mission that is critical for three governments. Don't bar my way."`
	"CN-13927" `	"If Parliament's interests involve listening in on a librarian's conversations, then the Republic is in quite a sorry shape."`
	"CN-13928" `	Uncannily, the agents all smirk at you at the same time. Kopkow responds flatly, "We don't respond well to threats."`
	"CN-13929" `	Giti gives a nervous laugh while Kopkow glares at you without blinking. You think you see him start to smile, but that may have been wishful thinking.`
	"CN-13930" `	"Now, Captain <last>, your friend Giti here has tripped a flag in our systems that marks what you're looking into as an item of particular interest to Syndicate Internal Affairs. In fact, it is an interest which they have exclusive and sole jurisdiction over, even over and above us." He looks at you meaningfully. "That requires an Act of Parliament in a closed session, which has not occurred for a significant length of time, if you catch my drift."`
	"CN-13931" `	He clears his throat. "We've been following you recently, and interrogating some people you've met. Since we have determined that you have found... something, and that it is meaningful, we must send you to Hephaestus. We request that you take Giti, any information or equipment you were planning to take, and go immediately and directly. Do you understand?"`
	"CN-13932" `	"It's time for you gentlemen to leave and let us get about our business."`
	"CN-13933" `	"I've always wanted to take a holiday on Hephaestus anyway. Let's go!"`
	"CN-13934" `	Agent Kopkow narrows his eyes at you very slightly. "This is not an optional request." Beyond your line of sight you can hear the faint rustle of clothing shift where the agents are still standing.`
	"CN-13935" `	"The answer is no and this conversation is over."`
	"CN-13936" `	You can feel fists hit either side of your head, and you pass out. A while later, you wake up gagged with four men holding your arms and legs. They're walking, carrying you somewhere. Eventually, they reach your ship and let you down. It seems this was not an optional trip after all.`
	"CN-13937" `	Once your fingers graze the edge of your pistol, a foot slams into side of your neck while a hand braces the opposite side of your head. You can hear your spine snap just before everything goes dark. As you ponder your mistake, you realize the rumors were true: the brain does survive for a few minutes without the body.`
	"CN-13938" `Despite expectations, you are told to leave Giti on the ship, and a man who immediately identifies himself to you as Deputy Director Stephen Moray meets you at the entrance of the docking tube at the spaceport and gestures you into the private antechamber attached to each dock in the <origin> port. "I work for Syndicate Internal Affairs. We're the internal police of the Syndicate; when an employee of any rank does misdeeds, we track them down. Janitor or executive; it doesn't matter. My department of Internal Affairs works on piracy-related matters."`
	"CN-13939" `	After you both sit, Stephen Moray turns on a device and places it on the table. "Communications jammer," he explains, "so we're not heard."`
	"CN-13940" `	"What is this about?"`
	"CN-13941" `	"I don't appreciate how your goons treated me."`
	"CN-13942" `	He shrugs. "Those 'goons' were from Republic Intelligence. I have no say as to how they do their jobs. Now that you're here, let's get down to business.`
	"CN-13943" `	"I know that you have been working closely with the Hai lately, helping to achieve an outcome with lasting stability. I communicated with Remington and he's informed me that while it might appear to an observer that you've caused a mess, that the Hai representatives have now explained that previous stalling on their part was because some things needed to be known first. It would seem that, as per usual, there is as much going on behind the scenes as in front and you have become embroiled in it.`
	"CN-13944" `	"I also understand what the Hai are grappling with right now," he says. "When I was a teenager, pirates kidnapped my brother and father, and forced them to serve on pirate vessels, calling them 'indentured servants.' My father watched helplessly as a Navy Frigate disabled my brother's just as it exited hyperspace. He escaped - but he's now serving his seventeenth year of a twenty-five-year sentence for piracy, even though his deeds were against his will," Moray explains as he lays out reports to emphasize his point.`
	"CN-13945" `	"I tell you this because it is important you understand I'm on your side. We haven't met before, but we must trust one another. You know the hails of the Navy: loyalty, honor, bravery - half-truths at best. We see the Navy as heroes because they are the only large organization capable of self-sacrifice. Yes, they do many good deeds, but those deeds blind us to their brutality and immorality. Not all humans are like that, many members of the Navy disagree with the barbaric rules about slavery. Some of us in the Syndicate, Free Worlds, and elsewhere, are trying to solve this problem.`
	"CN-13946" `	"In my time here, I have arranged for over eighty thousand slaves to be smuggled away from pirate planets to gain their freedom in Syndicate space. I have extensive contacts within the slaver community."`
	"CN-13947" `	"I'm glad to see there are good guys in the Syndicate."`
	"CN-13948" `	"That's a lot of good deeds for a Syndicate executive."`
	"CN-13949" `	"Did that freedom involve 100 hours a week of work in Syndicate factories?"`
	"CN-13950" `	He shrugs off your remark. "Now I understand you have found some things, that are also of historic interest to us. For this reason I am doubly invested; so now I need to know what you know."`
	"CN-13951" `	It would seem that this is the opportunity to hasten a desirable outcome most swiftly, though maybe the Syndicate doesn't need to know about the Hai's theories of cadmium poisoning from alien technology being used.`
	"CN-13952" `	"Here's some case location data on kidnapping victims." (Share only case location data, and don't mention the cadmium poisoning.)`
	"CN-13953" `	"I have a lot of data I'd like you to analyze." (Don't mention the cadmium poisoning, but share all other data.)`
	"CN-13954" `	Director Moray looks through some of the data you share while you summarize the key points. "Thank you very much, we will have our experts go over this promptly."`
	"CN-13955" `	With your explanation finished, he seems to straighten in preparation for something. "I have some leads to follow up. Someone has an extensive array of contacts, possibly close to home in the Syndicate - perhaps even executives, but for certain at least a department head somewhere. This is too much to be entirely independent. I can say for sure though that they're doing this without permission from the Syndicate proper.`
	"CN-13956" `	"The Hai have insisted they be involved in any solution which could involve captured Hai. Which means I will have to send you back to them soon, but before that I need information. So do you, but my due diligence demands I ensure you are properly equipped to retrieve what I need. Take Giti and the scanning equipment I am now loading onto your ship. I recommend a ramscoop for safety. Investigate the systems and bring her back here, after that you'll have to go back to the Hai without her."`
	"CN-13957" `	He pauses while getting ready to leave. "Oh, and you should probably tell her about the Hai at this point. We don't know if she knows, but if she doesn't she needs to know the basics. The scanners will flag anything we can explicitly identify as Hai tech, so the time has come. Good luck."`
	"CN-13958" `During the trip you take the time to tell Giti the basics about the Hai. She had already known they existed, but hadn't been privy to any details of what was going on now. Knowing that the disappearances you've been hunting extend to Hai space seems to answer more questions than it creates and she takes the revelation of how significant this is to current events easily in stride.`
	"CN-13959" `Once you reach Devil-Run, you see a wormhole, an unsurprising sight given the distance to Elenchus.`
	"CN-13960" `Giti turns on the scanning equipment.`
	"CN-13961" `	"Tell me about the moon."`
	"CN-13962" `	"Tell me about that planet."`
	"CN-13963" `	"We found what we need. Let's get out before we're noticed."`
	"CN-13964" `	"Okay, the planet..." Her voice trails off. "Wow! That's odd. This scanner is definitely not designed to properly scan this thing; I can only get surface readings.`
	"CN-13965" `	"Whatever it is, this planet is not normal by any stretch. It is completely inhospitable and appears to have a huge network of caves and caverns with crystalline structures that are radiating... something. Whatever it is, it's messing with the scanner's attempts to identify it. I'd have to know more about this scanner's functions to guess what the interference is. There's deuterium, though. Maybe the denizens of this system siphon the deuterium to make hyperspace fuel? Doesn't seem very efficient, but the solar wind is thin here. There's some kind of gravitational anomaly though, or maybe its just some kind of interference lensing. It looks like the planet has about a thousand times the mass it should, but with gravity around Earth normal. That... can't be right."`
	"CN-13966" `	She shakes it off and looks at you. "Whatever it is we're looking for, it's not down there."`
	"CN-13967" `	"The moon? Hmmm... okay, it's just an ordinary chunk of rock, but radiation from the planet is disturbing the sensors. I can only see a few dozen meters below ground, even though the scanner should be able to look down at least ten times that far... Aha!`
	"CN-13968" `	"I found something. There's a facility buried in the moon's surface. There is definitely a lot of Hai tech too, your concerns were spot on. I can only see the uppermost part of the facility, but it appears to be divided into two parts. One section has hydroponics, big cargo bays, docking bays for ships, even a small shipyard. Doesn't look like they have space for more than a handful of large ships, though. It also seems to have the only decently sized air processor I can identify. The other section is deeper, and appears to have some spacious living areas. I can see some support systems, but it seems that the air supply is effectively controlled from the surface access section. I can detect 1,387 people, though no details about them, and that's just in the upper three floors that I can see."`
	"CN-13969" `	She looks at you, eyes wide. "This isn't just a base; there's a base down there, but it's controlling a whole colony."`
	"CN-13970" `	There is a pregnant pause for a moment and then she suddenly gasps. "Captain, this must be Elenchus!"`
	"CN-13971" `	As you say this, you notice on your regular sensors that there are some ships heading your way and, more horrifyingly, some ground-based turrets coming online. It's time to go.`
	"CN-13972" `When you return to <origin>, Moray reclaims his scanning equipment and requests Giti's assistance with providing testimony to those interpreting it. She still may not know everything that's going on, but by this point she knows more than enough that she's happy to be able to assist in some way.`
	"CN-13973" `	Now there's nothing for it but to head straight on to <planet>.`
	"CN-13974" `When you return to <origin> to tell Teeneep what you have found, she seems to already know much of what you have to say. "We've been waiting for you. Thanks to your visit to the Syndicate, we've found a lot of information in very short order. You'll have to lead another international task force through the wormhole at Devil-Eye. This time, they'll have jump drives from the Unfettered, which the Hai are renting for quite a hefty price. We expect all jump drives to be returned intact. Everyone is gathering to brief you on the status so you can prepare for the mission. A high-ranking Marshal Kaine is here with more information."`
	"CN-13975" `	Sayari seems anxious when she joins you on the way, and the two of them draw you along towards one of the meeting areas in the secured spaceport. There you are led past a selection of Navy personnel on guard into a meeting room with several people. Some appear to have just arrived, but others must have been here for a while, and to your surprise Alondo and Remington are also present. The place looks to have been acting as a war room of sorts. As soon you've walked through the door, someone says, "We're all here," and Choot'k and Remington stand up from where they'd been looking at something intently.`
	"CN-13976" `	"I see new faces here. Can everyone introduce themselves?"`
	"CN-13977" `	"What have you found about the smuggling routes?"`
	"CN-13978" `	"How have you dealt with the smugglers so far?"`
	"CN-13979" `	"How do the Hai feel about the approach to the smugglers?"`
	"CN-13980" `	"Are you still able to keep the Hai a secret?"`
	"CN-13981" `	"What do you know about Elenchus?"`
	"CN-13982" `	"How will we penetrate the Elenchus defenses?"`
	"CN-13983" `	"We've discussed enough. It's time to get started."`
	"CN-13984" `	Remington looks at you. "I know it's rough when news travels ahead of you, but Moray's team identified two bases which act as holding facilities in human space for the previously unidentified group that you've been investigating. That's where the largest number of kidnapped Hai have been taken for processing, before being taken to this mysterious 'Elenchus' place you've found. One of the bases is on Deadman's Cove, and arrangements are already being made to deal with it, but the other one is right here on Stormhold.`
	"CN-13985" `	"This operation narrowed down our remaining search here to a single target in one area up in the north. It should take us no more than a few days to pinpoint it, and a few days more to plan and execute an action against it." He shrugs. "The information was just too important to delay it for your arrival. That, and they decided they wanted me here personally since Terry appears to be busy off doing something else."`
	"CN-13986" `	Marshal Kaine continues, "While there is intel on some captured Hai in the North, we have worked out a program to address that side of things more subtly, and with a lower risk to all parties involved. Raiding pirate ships is a deadly affair and their bases more so. While it may seem heroic, even with the help of the Hai, the casualty rate is unsustainable. However, while they may be allowed to go by intact, we have much better tabs on slaver and smuggler ships in the north, so we have options that don't require the sort of thorough manhunt that's occurring here to be effective."`
	"CN-13987" `	Sayari speaks up. "The Elders have accepted the proposed plans, but with this new information we have decided that this organization you've uncovered must still be dealt with directly. It is our main concern now. As long as the Republic remains willing to negotiate on how they deal with smugglers in the future, resolving this one issue will be sufficient for us to move forward. The overwhelming majority of the other groups who appear to have been exploiting Hai seem to have been here on <origin> and so we consider there to have been serious inroads made into resolving the problem more broadly."`
	"CN-13988" `	Remington responds. "Good point. I don't think everyone here knows everyone yet."`
	"CN-13989" `	You look around the room as Remington does introductions for the benefit of the new people, and counts off Teeneep, Sayari, Choot'k, Batu, Danforth, Adurath Kaine - a Marshal for the Navy, which is an ex-service political appointment - Alondo, and himself.`
	"CN-13990" `	Remington clearly did not need to be introduced, but doing so gives him a disarming charm, and you see for a moment some of the charisma that he must utilize as head of PR.`
	"CN-13991" `	Marshal Kaine introduces himself to you directly. "I'm the Marshal of the Third Armada, the guards of the Far North and the uninhabited regions near it. I know you've worked with my admiral William Danforth in the past, and he has spoken highly of your work. I'm here because occasionally the Navy needs a politician, and the politicians need someone from the service that understands politicians."`
	"CN-13992" `	Batu jumps in. "The Marshal has been very effective in helping to develop some solutions with Hiyamaharu, and has just arrived here to make sure everything is set in order."`
	"CN-13993" `	Remington explains. "This operation has gone on long enough that the popular opinion is that the Hai must obviously exist, even though there are no explicit voices saying as such. It has in fact almost become a joke; the perception being that, 'The Navy are blockading the Hai to hide humanity from them, because the blockade isn't doing a good job of being inconspicuous.' There have been memes of the Navy hiding their ships behind far too narrow light poles while they distract a squirrel with their headlights. Now it's a matter of being able to present good news. Place a successful spin on things."`
	"CN-13994" `	"Our problem," says Kaine, "is Elenchus."`
	"CN-13995" `	Marshal Kaine explains, "Reaching Elenchus would seem to be a problem, because it is behind systems we cannot reach with our hyperdrives. However, the Unfettered are willing to loan us a few jump drives. Additionally, the base on Elenchus appears to be a hardened target. It will need specialized and suitably equipped shock troops to be sure of taking it. In our assessment so far we have determined that the Syndicate have suitable troopers they can mobilize quickly, but no way of getting them there, and our suitable shock troops are largely pre-occupied; either being needed here on <origin>, or are at least a week away from being available. We need a resolution sooner than that."`
	"CN-13996" `	"What pressure is making this so urgent?"`
	"CN-13997" `	"Yes, clearly we need a quick resolution."`
	"CN-13998" `	Kaine sighs, and responds. "The thing about governments is that all crises are either to be solved, delayed, or weathered. This crisis cannot be delayed, and so they must choose to weather or resolve. There are enough representatives who feel that their positions are too fragile to weather it, and so they have pushed to resolve. The timeline is set by their perception of the urgency." He looks to the Hai. "And obviously, there are also those who value our historic relationship with the Hai and seek to resolve it for those reasons too. Those are only the first two reasons on a long list. At the end of the day, it's politics."`
	"CN-13999" `	Teeneep explains, "We also need a way to deal with the surface turrets and, short of bringing overwhelming firepower which we do not have, there's only one ship available with the systems to be able to affect that within our timeline. That ship is my Centipede. I had installed electronic warfare systems on it to baffle pirate defenses when I was investigating this before. It is our assessment that I should be able to baffle the turrets long enough to deal with any spaceship defenders, and land where the turrets will no longer matter." She looks to Choot'k. "The General has generously offered to loan a drive for my use."`
	"CN-14000" `	Choot'k addresses the group. "The designs of the facility show a weak point in one of the hangars, which we can exploit. My flagship has advanced ionic weaponry, that combined with enough raw burst firepower will disable and get rid of the hangar door without destroying too much of the hangar itself.`
	"CN-14001" `	"I also have two trusted captains who have been exploring the value of human weapons while they've been here, and think they have some winning combinations they would like to test in battle. I have chosen them to make use of our remaining available drives, and out of consideration for you humans. It would seem that the fewer alien weapons we carry through your space, the better."`
	"CN-14002" `	Marshal Kaine nods in agreement. "We have all the pieces. The solution therefore, is this: <last> will escort Danforth's Cruiser, the Elder and her Centipede, the General and his Shield Beetle, and two of his closest captains to Foundry. There you'll meet up with Agent Kopkow and Captain Wallace - a decorated Navy captain who has a Parliamentary Medal of Valor for handling the rescue of slaves - who will be bringing her empty Auxiliary, and one Free World Dreadnought that the good Alondo here had the foresight to make sure was stationed nearby. There you'll load up the Syndicate troopers and go to Elenchus."`
	"CN-14003" `	Kaine looks at you all with an odd expression and concludes, "As plans go, it's mental. But every one of you will be heroes if you can pull it off."`
	"CN-14004" `	General Choot'k says, "I look forward to joining your people in combat. We haven't had enough chances to fight with - or against - your species. I hope we won't be disappointed."`
	"CN-14005" `	"I can vouch for the skill of our people, but not the pirates," Kaine replies, smiling.`
	"CN-14006" `	Danforth turns to you, "So, Captain, to Foundry, when you're ready."`
	"CN-14007" `You arrive on Foundry to a little-used spaceport which usually sees only private, Syndicate executive vessels. Kopkow gives you a mildly apologetic smile as he greets you for the second time, and introduces you to Captain Anna Wallace. She expresses her satisfaction that some serious efforts are being made to stem the plague of slavery that pirate factions get away with. Apparently many officers like her disagree with the Navy's standard non-boarding policy. They want to rescue slaves whenever possible, regardless of risk or orders.`
	"CN-14008" `	Just Wallace speaking seems to make Kopkow nervous to move on though; in fact he appears very stressed at the present. Kopkow explains, "It's becoming increasingly difficult to cover up the existence of the Hai."`
	"CN-14009" `	"We only need to maintain the ruse a little longer."`
	"CN-14010" `	"You don't know that we've given up on that?"`
	"CN-14011" `	"Is it still working at all?"`
	"CN-14012" `	"Our ruse is getting preposterous. The captains at Ultima Thule already know about the Hai, but we had to tell the crews that we were dealing with a major pirate threat. We hired a few pirate gangs to fly through the area to back our story. The Shield Beetles you've just flown here have been explained away as experimental ship designs from the movie production being tested out. Still though, our cover stories have passed the point of plausibility into the realm of barefaced lying. I hope you can finish this without too many more public displays, otherwise we won't be able to hide the Hai anymore."`
	"CN-14013" `	He blinks at you, "Wait, what?"`
	"CN-14014" `	"We've decided on an end point to this deception?"`
	"CN-14015" `	You explain how they're just trying to keep things going long enough to resolve this mission. It is like a load has been lifted off the man, although he takes it in his stride fairly professionally.`
	"CN-14016" `	"Of course, nobody tells me anything in a timely manner..."`
	"CN-14017" `	"Anyway, I've organized the Syndicate's 'hostile urban insertion security operatives' to be loaded onto the Auxiliary. They look like intelligence operatives, if you ask me, so that'll be a conversation for me to follow up on later, but for now they're specially trained for attacking pirate strongholds and equipped with state of the art equipment that... is on a need-to-know basis. As long as we can protect the Auxiliary we'll be fine. The intel you brought back doesn't suggest particularly strong resistance. Wallace, good luck."`
	"CN-14018" `	"It's good to hear you have the ground combat situation under control."`
	"CN-14019" `	"That equipment sounds ominous."`
	"CN-14020" `	Kopkow gives you a disturbing smile that has an 'I love my work' appearance. He departs as everyone else assembles.`
	"CN-14021" `	"It's more of a collaboration, really, but like I said: need-to-know basis." He nods to you and departs as everyone else assembles.`
	"CN-14022" `	After a large meeting about logistics, and an unsurmountable buffet, everyone disperses. General Choot'k finds you to discuss critical tactical matters.`
	"CN-14023" `	"There's a problem with the plan," he says, "which we found after more analysis of the scans. The bay where we need to land already has ships inside, and if we try to fly in there, they'll blow us to pieces. You have lure them out and kill them all."`
	"CN-14024" `	"How do I lure them out?"`
	"CN-14025" `	"Can't we blow them up on the way down?"`
	"CN-14026" `	"Have you ever tried to land on a pile of blown-up space ships in the wreck of a spaceport a half kilometer underground? It ain't easy."`
	"CN-14027" `	Choot'k looks amused by your surprise at his pointed use of a colloquialism. Maybe one day you should investigate how and why the Unfettered learn your language. In the meantime, not blowing up your landing site is a sufficient lesson.`
	"CN-14028" `	"I've spent a lot of time interrogating pirate leaders these past few weeks, and they all have one thing in common: narcissism. Threaten their precious egos, and they'll fight when they should hide. All you have to do is demand tribute from their planet and the fools will rush out and fight you.`
	"CN-14029" `	"The pirates won't believe it if we demand the tribute, but they will believe it if you demand it. Then their defense fleets will rush out. You have to defeat them on your own to maintain the ruse. Eventually they'll give up and pay tribute. That's when we know it's safe to land."`
	"CN-14030" `	"Sounds good. I look forward to the tribute payments."`
	"CN-14031" `	"Why do I have to do that myself?"`
	"CN-14032" `	"In your culture, governments don't demand tribute from enemy planets." He shrugs. "The pirates will see it as an obvious trap if we do it. You, though? They'll see a pilot taking advantage of the situation. Just lure them out, and blow them up, while we hold off any incoming ships."`
	"CN-14033" `	"Why won't our fleet help me destroy the pirates coming from the planet?"`
	"CN-14034" `	"Ah, they could, but they won't. Consider it a test. I want to see you prove yourself in battle before I open the entrance to <planet>."`
	"CN-14035" `	He seems to admire your ship for a moment. "If you succeed today you shall be Hai-friend, wherever you go."`
	"CN-14036" `To complete this mission, you must land with Choot'k, Teeneep, Danforth and Wallace's ships all present in the system and intact...`
	"CN-14037" `Teeneep sends out a message to the fleet informing you that she is engaging the electronic warfare baffling and reminds you that everyone needs to get onto the ground intact if this is to go well. The general's ship is the Emperor Beetle, Kratos. The baffling won't work forever, so get to it.`
	"CN-14038" `	(NOTE: You need to dominate this planet to finish the battle. To do that, talk to the planet and demand tribute. The planet will send multiple waves of defense fleets. Demand tribute after defeating the final wave, and they'll agree. Then land to finish the mission.)`
	"CN-14039" `	(WARNING: The allies you are escorting will not help you fight the defense fleets sent in response to your tribute demands, but they will fight any other pirate ships in the system.)`
	"CN-14040" `To finish this mission, you must destroy all defending pirate vessels, and land with Choot'k, Teeneep, Danforth and Wallace's ships all present in the system and intact...`
	"CN-14041" `General Choot'k cuts open the doors of a large hangar, and your ships land. The two hundred Syndicate operatives pour out, wearing exoskeletons with high density armor plating and equipped with all manner of weapons and gadgetry. They storm through the complex and you follow in their wake. Their tools melt through security locks in seconds, and most of their opposition lacks protection against the suits' stun gas bombs. With pirates focusing their efforts on the imposing suits, the Unfettered make many attacks of opportunity, inflicting massive casualties. The pirates outnumber the attackers ten to one, but this huge advantage in equipment, training, and discipline gives the attackers an overwhelming advantage.`
	"CN-14042" `	The squads move room to room, neutralizing all opposition with ease, until their opponents switch tactics. The pirates begin using electromagnetic pulse devices to shut down the Syndicate suits (and all other electronics nearby), leaving affected operatives helpless for ten long seconds. Here, some of General Choot'k's Unfettered show their strength, outmaneuvering the pirates long enough for the suits to recharge. They dart between operatives and bound off walls with Pulse Rifles and long knives. They strike rapidly and in an organized manner, before withdrawing as the operatives suits re-engage, preventing the pirates from coordinating a counter-assault.`
	"CN-14043" `	After a bloody struggle, forty-three operatives reach the end of the fight, clearing the way to a blast door. Only a couple dozen operatives are known to be seriously wounded, but many have been missing since the pirates switched tactics and began using traps and machinery to pin, crush, or disable the operatives or their suits. The Unfettered fared comparatively better, as the pirates focused most attacks on the Syndicate operatives, letting the fast, maneuverable Hai pass through. Still, over a dozen of them will take their own tails home as trophies, after the pirates used a miner's cutting power-arm extensions to great effect.`
	"CN-14044" `	The blast door that the force now stands before is twelve meters high and wide, and scanners show it to be six meters deep. It is designed to be closed from this side, though, and has not been sealed well against being reopened. Soon it grinds open but, evidently sabotaged, only part-way. Despite this attempt, the operatives put on their goggles and easily pass through into the darkness of the next room.`
	"CN-14045" `	You could be forgiven for hesitating to follow them, but General Choot'k appears beside you and places one strong paw on your shoulder. "Come, now. We will discover if our task is finished or impossible. It is time for bravery." He guides you in after the operatives, along with his own troops.`
	"CN-14046" `	"Lead on."`
	"CN-14047" `	"Treating me like a coward? That's grounds for a duel."`
	"CN-14048" `	"Heh heh," he laughs in a low voice. "Maybe soon."`
	"CN-14049" `	It's pitch black when you enter, but scanners show the room is a vast cavern, some sort of public space suitable for ten thousand people or more. As the last of the troops file in, a second blast door closes behind you. High roof lights snap on making the room as bright as day in the blink of an eye.`
	"CN-14050" `	You see before you scores of pirates, corralled and held captive by an equally large crowd of heavily-armed civilians - all of which are hesitantly pointing guns at the operatives. It seems the citizens arranged a violent rebellion to coincide with the Republic's attack. Three unarmed civilians wearing distinctive hooded robes walk towards the operatives: one Hai, one human, and to your surprise one lizard-like Korath. The leader of the Syndicate operatives exits her suit and approaches them.`
	"CN-14051" `	The Hai speaks. "We are the leaders of the civilian government of Elenchus. Although we are grateful for your assistance in defeating our violent rulers, we will not accept your dominion either. We have heard of your civil war. Elenchus is an independent nation, and we intend to stay so unless you intend to force otherwise. I can, however, promise that unlike our overlords, we have no interest in anything other than peace. We will send no military ships through the wormhole."`
	"CN-14052" `	After several hours of discussion, Agent Kopkow prepares the documents for the provisional recognition of the new "Elenctic Commune" with Admiral Danforth and Captain Wallace as witnesses. The wounded are finally attended to in the Elenctic hospital facilities, and most of the human operatives pack up their gear and return to the Auxiliary. Meanwhile, Teeneep and Choot'k go to lengths to engage with the Hai here and discover what they would best like to do.`
	"CN-14053" `	"Thank you. I have a few questions for you before I go."`
	"CN-14054" `	"I wish you a successful future with your newfound freedom. For now, it is time for me to depart."`
	"CN-14055" `	"Do you want me to take you home?"`
	"CN-14056" `	"Do you know anything about the cadmium poisoning?"`
	"CN-14057" `	"What can you tell me about this city?"`
	"CN-14058" `	"What do you do here?"`
	"CN-14059" `	"What do you know about this area of space?"`
	"CN-14060" `	"How did the Korath get here?"`
	"CN-14061" `	"Can you speak to other Korath for me?"`
	"CN-14062" `	"It was a pleasure meeting you," says the human leader.`
	"CN-14063" `	The Korath leader speaks, with a thick, sibilant accent. "Several generations ago, three of our raiding ships jumped to the Alcyone system. Numerous pirate vessels left Stormhold and disabled our ships. A large human ship boarded our flagship, and used what you call 'nerve gas' to kill the entire crew. The death is excruciatingly painful to Korath. The pirates broadcast the footage over to us, so we could see the screaming. Not wanting that fate, most of the raiders on the other Korath ships surrendered. We worked as slaves for the pirate gangs, but now we're here, safe, and free. We are not specialists or their descendants like the others here, but we have other talents.`
	"CN-14064" `	"The pirates must defend this planet against a space-based lifeform that attacks in flocks. Our ships gave them a significant advantage. Fortunately, we have one more left to defend against any threats." The Korath eyes the Syndicate operatives as he waits for the translator to catch up.`
	"CN-14065" `	"I must ask you keep the presence of Korath here a secret. If the Archons or other Exiles hear of this place, they may attack to retrieve us, or the Exiles may simply pillage. We will remain here in hiding unless the Exiles finally learn to settle on their planet."`
	"CN-14066" `	The Korath leader hisses. "No, we cannot. We here do not even speak a full form of our own language anymore. Even if we did, we must remain here in secret. Perhaps in time there will be a reconnection, but not yet."`
	"CN-14067" `	The Korath leader looks to the Hai, who responds, "Is that how you were led back here?"`
	"CN-14068" `	"Indirectly," you reply.`
	"CN-14069" `	The Hai leader continues, "Fascinating, we always wondered if it would pique someone's attention! Our Korath friends have ships equipped with these remarkable 'Systems Cores,' which are apparently vital to all Korath ships. None of the surviving Korath had the knowledge to replicate it, but they were asked to try and many of them have an uncanny knack for engineering. With their help, we attempted to build some equivalents of our own. Being not quite right, they work, but they fuse irrevocably with the ship, and some flaw in their function causes cadmium particulate. The cadmium is shed by the system maintenance processes into the air, where it is recirculated, and ignored by the system intended to filter it out since it's a part of the system itself."`
	"CN-14070" `	The human leader adds, "We worked out how to reduce that effect to safe levels, but kept that information to ourselves in the hope that it would draw some attention. It tended to make the pirates sick more often than anyone else, which also seemed to mean that more of their victims escaped."`
	"CN-14071" `	The three leaders laugh, and the Hai answers. "We are home. Most of us were born here, or have lived most of our adult lives here. This is a place of learning, where three races join as one to progress together. Even several of the new arrivals had few connections back in Hai space and have viewed this place as a grand new novelty. An adventure without compare. Some recent kidnapping victims wish to leave, of course, and we will help you find them and send them home."`
	"CN-14072" `	The Korath speaks next. "Where my people came from, everyone was starving, barely subsisting. We had to raid for supplies, or slave away in bleak factory stations. This is a much better place for us."`
	"CN-14073" `	The human leader concludes, "Most of the humans in this city have been here for several generations. This has always been home to us."`
	"CN-14074" `	"It must seem strange to you," the human replies, "but I shall explain. This place was founded over a hundred and twenty years ago by anarchists from the colony of Freedom. Their community had been working within the Syndicate for a long time, evolving into anarcho-syndicalists that worked to bring the Syndicate down from within. At some point they discovered this place after stealing a drive and other paraphernalia that were unearthed from a construction site on Foundry. With the Syndicate on its doorstep and difficult access requirements, they saw the potential in this place but needed more manpower to exploit it. To do this, they allied with less peaceful anarchists and pirates. Those less savory types kidnapped researchers and engineers, forcing them to expand the base and devise new weapons or medicines. They eventually inherited control here after the syndicalists were wiped out. Our city also has manufacturing facilities where we created goods the pirates could not easily build in human space, where their facilities are destroyed regularly.`
	"CN-14075" `	"There have been various attempts to take the spaceport and the city by force or by money. Early on, there were attempts by Alpha groups, and then various illegal organizations who tracked this place down from rumors about their rivals. There was even someone from the Syndicate who came with his personal fleet. There are those who have controlled this place by controlling the spaceport and treating with us, and there are those who have tried to force their way in here and bend us to their will. None of them returned home from the latter attempts. Some used chemical or biological weapons, others sent ships. Many offered money or favors. Elenchus has always been an independent country, and with control of our own spaceport, perhaps we always will be.`
	"CN-14076" `	"Now that the pirates are gone, us civilians may govern without fear, and for that you have our gratitude. As expendable upper regions of the spaceport have already been destroyed, we have little to fear from attack by space creatures in the short-term, and soon we'll have our shipyards and facilities at full capacity again, such that we may defend ourselves.`
	"CN-14077" `	"We won't ever join the Republic or any other government beyond the wormhole, but you personally will always be welcome, along with those you trust, for what you have done today. Our research and manufacturing facilities are damaged now, but as they are repaired, we will make them available to you."`
	"CN-14078" `	"We're scientists, engineers, philosophers, people of learning. Intergenerational traditions of knowledge and scholarship are strong here. There are laboratories and workshops throughout this city where we work on all manner of things. We seek knowledge. This place is far from being a paradise, but it is a community that strives together. Under the pirates we were allowed this freedom, as they realized it was the most effective way to get results that helped them. Now that our most recent abusive masters are gone, we need not have our priorities guided by their violent motives."`
	"CN-14079" `	"Of course, this is also a city. People have lived here for several generations, multiplying fruitfully. We have had to carve out more and more of the moon. There is plenty of space left before our growth will have to stop."`
	"CN-14080" `	"Very little. The pirates wouldn't let us leave the planet, and jump drives are precious to them. They cannot risk drives on science expeditions. Still, we have managed a few trips under different regimes."`
	"CN-14081" `	"There is no evidence that any civilization has ever reached this region of space until us, and this system is not native to the others around it. It was flung from our galaxy millions of years ago, and is still traveling relatively fast. One day, far from now, this system will pass beyond even this loose collection of systems that it is now close to. There are also many space-faring indigenous creatures that live in gas giants, and sometimes venture beyond. Most are harmless, so long as you leave them alone. There are flocking apex predators who hunt anything that moves.`
	"CN-14082" `	"The planet below is a mystery to us. It has a thousand times the mass it realistically should, and its gravitational field reads as such from a great distance. This tremendous gravitational field sustains the large asteroid belt. Despite its incredible mass, as you approach the surface, the field does not increase at anywhere near the rate that it should. Thus, when you stand upon it, the gravity is only similar to that of Earth. There are many forms of radiation and strange materials inside the planet's caves. We believe it is a relic from a forgotten past, but we have no idea what sort of relic it is. Perhaps, now that we are not developing pirate weapons, we can focus on exploration."`
	"CN-14083" `	There is one last critical matter to be addressed with the three representatives and you raise it with them. "Did we have all of the leaders of this group? Are they all accounted for?"`
	"CN-14084" `	They consult with some of their people who have been scouring the spaceport, helping to account for both the living, and the dead on both sides. At length, just the human comes to you.`
	"CN-14085" `	"Your question was wise. There is one unaccounted for. Before I tell you, though, I think perhaps you should know more than you do." They reach up and push back their hood, revealing a bald head, as they gesture to the city in general. To your surprise you realize for the first time that they are a woman, though that seems like it could be the least important part of their identity.`
	"CN-14086" `	"What do you wish to tell me?"`
	"CN-14087" `	"I've had enough history lessons for one day. Can you tell me the leader's name?"`
	"CN-14088" `	"Many different overlords we have had, and always they have relied on recruits from the city for some capacities while rallying other lesser groups to their banner. As such, ever have there been factions. Some, kinder than others."`
	"CN-14089" `	They look at you meaningfully. "There was a factional shift in progress here before you arrived. A little over a decade ago, for the first time in a century, a new anarcho-syndicalist faction from Freedom took over the control of the spaceport and reclaimed the mantle of our original founders who called themselves 'Base Principles.' While we as a city didn't particularly care, there were some who sympathized with them more than most. As overlords went they were, fair enough. After only a decade, and despite significantly greater access to resources than their predecessors, their control was already slipping. Deviants and extremists who lacked the capacity to subscribe to a nuanced view had supplanted most of their major players. If they did not succeed in their quest imminently, they were already doomed to be replaced. Still, they were nevertheless exploitative overlords, and we don't pity them... but their goals were more noble than most.`
	"CN-14090" `	"I tell you all this because I suspect you must seek out this one leader who is unaccounted for, and you should do so with all the knowledge at your disposal. The one leader who is not here was the last major player from the new 'Base Principles.' I do not know where your loyalties lie, so I ask you: why do you wish to know?"`
	"CN-14091" `	They sigh. "The one leader who is not here was the last major player from the new 'Base Principles.' I do not know where your loyalties lie, so I ask you: why do you wish to know?"`
	"CN-14092" `	"I do not, but I must, out of duty."`
	"CN-14093" `	"I wish to know, for the Hai."`
	"CN-14094" `	"I wish to know, for the Syndicate."`
	"CN-14095" `	"I wish to know, for the people."`
	"CN-14096" `	They regard you thoughtfully. "You are well suited to the neutral ground. It is little wonder you are here as an agent of no single faction. That is appropriate then.`
	"CN-14097" `	They incline their head respectfully. "The Hai are perhaps the greatest valuers of truth among us. If they have set you to this, then they will be honored by your diligence.`
	"CN-14098" `	They focus on you closely. "The Syndicate is perhaps the most impressive machine ever wrought by man. It is worthy of both respect and fear, and will do to people as any machine does to the product of its design. Treat it as such and it will always do precisely what you expect it to; both good and bad.`
	"CN-14099" `	They lift their head and smile. "A promise made is a promise kept. If your word is your bond then it would not do for me to stand in its way.`
	"CN-14100" `	"The missing leader you seek is embedded within the Syndicate and is known by the name Terry Adrianopoulos."`
	"CN-14101" `	"Terry did this!?"`
	"CN-14102" `	"I suspected as much."`
	"CN-14103" `	Their words scratch an itch of suspicion that you didn't realize had been irritating you until now. They smirk knowingly. "I have merely confirmed that which you already guessed. Very well, I need say no more. This matter is yours to do with as you will." They leave you to ponder your course.`
	"CN-14104" `	They smile with subtle mirth at your surprise. "I see you know of this person but did not suspect. I think it is to you, and you alone, I shall impart this knowledge. Do with it as you will." They leave you to ponder your course.`
	"CN-14105" `	As you return to your ship, Teeneep interrupts you. "I need you to escort me one last time, Captain <last>. I must return to <planet> to resolve things now that the threat is ended. You will be well-paid, of course."`
	"CN-14106" `	Anticipating your next question, she says, "The ships of the Unfettered Hai will be escorted back with us, since the Elenctics are convinced they are at no risk and still have a ship at their disposal. Some of those who came as crew on the Unfettered vessels have chosen to remain here and join the Elenctics. More than enough bunks have subsequently been freed to return those who have chosen to come home with us. Danforth will come with us, but the other human vessels will make their way home themselves. Now we must rejoin our people on <planet> and set about resolving this matter for good, finally."`
	"CN-14107" `Your arrival on <origin> is met with much fanfare. In your absence the remaining staging ground here was eventually found and purged, and an agreement of sorts has been made between the Republic authorities and the remaining major players here - or at least those whose lists of possible crimes aren't so long and well-evidenced as to be arrested for appearing. The hope is that after such a thorough purge, <origin> will manage to be less of a source of problems for a while, but the expectation is merely that people smuggling will no longer be an industry that is widely tolerated by the local powers that be.`
	"CN-14108" `	The Unfettered are treated as heroes by both their comrades and the other Hai crews as they return to the fold. This causes some, like Remington and Alondo, to share some concerned looks among each other and have a number of surreptitious chats with Danforth and Marshal Kaine, but the distinction between the two groups remains pronounced throughout.`
	"CN-14109" `	Once people have had a chance to get sorted Teeneep approaches you again. "There will be much work in the future, but for now it is time to return to <planet>. I have been too long away, and there are obligations to be discharged. I have returned the borrowed jump drive, so we should pick up the Deputy Minister from Mountaintop on the way."`
	"CN-14110" `When you land, you, Teeneep, and the Unfettered Hai are greeted as heroes. Word has traveled ahead of you through the new message links, and you are greeted by a hastily planned celebration in the capitol. After a few hours involving a brief formal parade, a great deal of cheering, some minor speeches with Xilin and Alondo trotted out to reassure everyone that there would be no conflict, and finally some more discrete parties outside the public eye, General Choot'k comes to you and Teeneep to bid his farewell.`
	"CN-14111" `	He shakes your hand and says, "You're a fine warrior, Captain <last>. You are as much a True Hai as any human can be, and it was an honor to fight alongside you in battle."`
	"CN-14112" `	Then he turns to Teeneep and tells her, "You're the future leader of all our people, Teeneep. Come back with me to Darkcloak. Join the True Hai and lead us to victory."`
	"CN-14113" `	Teeneep smiles and says, "My fight is here, general. I fight for the hearts and minds of our Fettered brethren that we may find a true path. One day we will again be one people."`
	"CN-14114" `	Teeneep is quiet for a while after he departs, but soon enough the statesperson in her has walked you back into the celebrations, making sure to leave you with Sayari so she can keep you from embarrassing yourself.`
	"CN-14115" `	You're nursing the warmth of a beverage after breakfast the next morning on far too little sleep when your communicator pings. When it turns out to be Sayari, you take a moment to thank your body clock for ensuring you were already dressed and decent today, despite the suffering over it.`
	"CN-14116" `	"So glad to see that you've pulled up alright this morning," she says. "As one final thing, we all need to go and meet the human leaders on Mountaintop and finally close the book on this chapter. We could take any ship at this point, but I cannot overstate how much you've helped us. I thought you might like to see it through to the end.`
	"CN-14117" `	"We'll be ready to go in a couple of hours. What do you say?"`
	"CN-14118" `	"Seems silly not to come on the final trip. Of course I'll take you."`
	"CN-14119" `Arriving on Mountaintop, you see the station has seen serious renovations including a grand ballroom, all manner of diplomatic suites, and a notable lack of movie props. Rather than actors and stage crew, you see many familiar and unfamiliar people in full diplomatic regalia, and dress uniforms laden with medals abound on all sides. The Chancellor of the Free Worlds and President of the Republic are in their most respectable suits, while Alondo and Xilin have the traditional symbols of office (though Alondo's looks like the Free Worlds have perhaps not finalized their design just yet). You appear to be a guest of honor, occasionally being called upon to answer idle queries from people seeking clarity on one point or another but otherwise left to yourself. As you mingle with those taking a break from their duties throughout these preliminary meetings, you notice Remington and Terry are conspicuously absent.`
	"CN-14120" `	(Ask Xilin about it.)`
	"CN-14121" `	Between scheduled sessions, Xilin explains the Syndicate's absence. "The Syndicate is technically part of the Republic and awarded no special diplomatic status. Besides, Terry seems to have disappeared from Syndicate communications, though I won't hazard a guess as to their internal politics."`
	"CN-14122" `	At one quiet point between structured meetings, during which the peripheral conversations are more focused on the particulars of the Free Worlds' position, you manage to get a hold of Xilin to ask about it. He explains the Syndicate's absence. "The Syndicate is technically part of the Republic and awarded no special diplomatic status. Besides, Terry seems to have disappeared from Syndicate communications, though I won't hazard a guess as to their internal politics."`
	"CN-14123" `	Perhaps seizing on the opportunity to get a momentary reprieve from more official business, the President himself steps in to fill the gap as soon as Xilin departs. It seems that you acquire a bubble of space around you whenever anyone of note stands next to you, and the President exploits this. "You know," he says quietly, while staring out at the many people hustling about at their business, "it's not very often that someone has the gall to patronize me to my face... I usually have to pay people to do that, or at least, to do it constructively anyway."`
	"CN-14124" `	The pause he leaves between sentences is just slightly too short to invite a response. "If you ever decide on a career change, that might be an option for you."`
	"CN-14125" `	He exhales through his nose as if chuckling at something humorous. "Fly safe, Captain; a lot of people know who you are now."`
	"CN-14126" `	With that he steps away directly to meet an aide who had been hurrying towards you both, intent on ignoring the bubble. From across the room you catch Xilin with his eyebrows raised, giving you a curious look despite being engaged in his own conversation. Neither of them speak to you again for the remainder of the meetings.`
	"CN-14127" `	Eventually you follow the diplomats to a room called the Grand Borealis Chamber, "Where Mountains Touch The Sky," as Teeneep makes the first publicly broadcast speech from the Hai to humanity. The three heads of state announce a resolution granting safe passage to all Hai in human space, as long as they register with customs on Mountaintop before entering, and Teeneep expresses similar sentiments for humans visiting Hai space. It is announced that extensive surveillance fleets will be posted on both sides of the wormhole to ensure safety. This meeting will now turn into a multi-day summit to discuss the creation of a formal treaty.`
	"CN-14128" `	As you leave the summit for lunch, Xilin and Sayari intercept you.`
	"CN-14129" `	"Trouble. We need to talk," says Xilin. You follow them to a private meeting room.`
	"CN-14130" `	"What's wrong?"`
	"CN-14131" `	"Really? I thought we had figured everything out."`
	"CN-14132" `	"Hey, don't worry. Whatever it is, I'm sure we've been through worse."`
	"CN-14133" `	Sayari rolls her eyes and says, "Don't relax yet, Captain <last>. There is one more minor disaster to be averted."`
	"CN-14134" `	Sayari says, "It would have been too easy if it was all over. We have one more minor disaster to avert first."`
	"CN-14135" `	Xilin begins. "It seems that somewhere along the way, a shipload of kidnapped Hai didn't make it to a processing area. The Hai were left on Sunracer, and the ship appears to have disappeared."`
	"CN-14136" `	"For the moment," says Sayari, "We're the only ones who know about it. The Hai are in hiding but have tapped into a communication grid. I intercepted their transmission as it was routed through this station directly."`
	"CN-14137" `	Xilin looks at you pointedly. "We need you to go pick them up and bring them here. While you're at it, make sure there aren't any loose ends. If there are, this resolution may not happen, despite everything we've achieved."`
	"CN-14138" `	"Of course. I'll take care of it."`
	"CN-14139" `	"You deal with the diplomacy, and leave the heroism to me."`
	"CN-14140" `	The two look considerably less worried as you leave to solve this one last problem.`
	"CN-14141" `Arriving on Sunracer, you follow the coded coordinates you were given to avoid drawing unnecessary attention. With the Hai's first public appearance only just days past and still dominating the news cycle, you've been instructed to keep this as low-profile as possible. Fortunately, a glance at the feeds your ship picks up seems to indicate that the government response has taken the wind out of the more sensationalist talking heads - or at least the ones with notable followings.`
	"CN-14142" `	The coordinates turn out to lead to a lean-to town built around a Star Barge. The Hai here were unable to all fit on the ship and appear to have built shelters out of local flora to keep out the weather. The communicator on the barge must be what was used to send a message. You find a clear space to land not too far away and make your way over.`
	"CN-14143" `	One of the Hai approaches you. "Are you Captain <last>?"`
	"CN-14144" `	"Yes, that is me."`
	"CN-14145" `	He appears visibly relieved. "Oh good. We've been very concerned since we were dropped here. It's all very strange... we've no idea what's going on anymore."`
	"CN-14146" `	"The Hai are no longer a secret in human space, but they are concerned how you ended up here."`
	"CN-14147" `	"What happened to the ship that brought you here?"`
	"CN-14148" `	"Well, let's get you home before anything else happens."`
	"CN-14149" `	"Ah, we thought we saw something about that, but our comms are spotty, so we didn't rely on it. We all actually signed up to go to Mountaintop to take part in the facade, so it seemed especially suspicious."`
	"CN-14150" `	He shrugs. "An abundance of caution seemed warranted; we were kidnapped, after all."`
	"CN-14151" `	"We were en route to somewhere after the ship left Hai space. We don't really know what happened, but they received some kind of message that left them very concerned. They said something about hiding somewhere safe and landed here."`
	"CN-14152" `	At this point, he twists his face in a non-human manner you recognize as a Hai frown. "We were set down here for days and days. Our kidnappers couldn't seem to work out what they should do. Eventually, a woman landed next to us in this ship here," he explains, gesturing at the Star Barge. "She had them ferry us and all our stuff out to this ship, and then she took charge and flew off with them. That was when we sent the message. We were partly afraid it was some kind of elaborate trap when we saw that we could communicate to a Hai address directly. We never used to be able to communicate between human space and ours like that. I guess we were lucky this time."`
	"CN-14153" `	"Do you know where they went?"`
	"CN-14154" `	"What did this woman look like?"`
	"CN-14155" `	"The woman was very fierce and very strict about what people said aloud. She disciplined a number of our kidnappers in front of us for opening their mouths at the wrong time. We have no idea where they went, but we did hear one of them say that they were afraid they wouldn't be welcome there. It sounded like it was out of the way somewhere, wherever it was."`
	"CN-14156" `	The Hai sincerely thanks you, and they load their meager possessions and board your ship in less than twenty minutes. The Star Barge isn't in good shape after being lived in instead of flown, so you leave it behind. The woman they described is almost undoubtedly Terry.`
	"CN-14157" `	When you return to Mountaintop, an all-Hai greeting party is waiting to provide aid and coordinate the safe return of those you've rescued from Sunracer. It appears to have avoided media attention, and the summit is progressing toward a resolution at an acceptable rate. It's been slow going: the Hai and human legal systems are so different that establishing common legal terms of reference has been a long-winded exercise.`
	"CN-14158" `	You've had a couple of days to contemplate the turn of events that led to you hauling a group of spontaneously abandoned Hai out of Syndicate space. The timing seems suspect, the individual seems familiar, and there's just something about what the Philosophers said that you just can't shake.`
	"CN-14159" `	While your passengers are quietly loaded onto a handful of transports to be taken home, Sayari and Xilin find you somewhere quiet. "Thank you, <last>. You had all the necessary discretion at this sensitive time," says Sayari.`
	"CN-14160" `	Xilin is more direct, "I'll certainly thank you for saving me from another headache. Was there anything else you found? It seems so odd."`
	"CN-14161" `	"There is something, but I should deal with it myself."`
	"CN-14162" `	They both frown and huddle in closer. "Do you think some of the kidnappers escaped? Do you think they'll continue?" asks Sayari.`
	"CN-14163" `	"No, but I think there's one thing I should check out."`
	"CN-14164" `	Xilin raises an eyebrow. "Is this something I'm going to have to report?"`
	"CN-14165" `	"Not if I can help it."`
	"CN-14166" `	"Hopefully not, but we'll see."`
	"CN-14167" `	You leave them with only guesses. You're not entirely sure yourself what's going on, but you do know one thing: you have to go to Freedom, where this all began.`
	"CN-14168" `	When you land on Freedom, the spaceport is busy as ever, but as you go around asking if anyone has seen a woman matching Terry's description, people start acting unusually toward you. You wouldn't describe it as frosty: no one actually seems to know anything, and they remain as friendly and helpful as you'd expect a bunch of anarchists to be. Yet, the more you ask around, the more it seems that people are following you around and whispering to each other. You wonder just who Terry really is, and just how deeply involved she was. She seems to have been one step ahead all the way.`
	"CN-14169" `	As you go down a short, wide alley flanked by tall buildings, you hear the creak of hinges behind you and turn around to see a great wooden gate being closed. The same happens in front of you at the other end of the alley, and the people in the alley suddenly disappear through doorways. As you're looking around, you realize nearly a dozen plasma rifles are pointing at you from windows in upper floors.`
	"CN-14170" `	(Shout.)`
	"CN-14171" `	(Raise my hands.)`
	"CN-14172" `	The people in the windows don't take very kindly to your decision, and very quickly make sure it's your last.`
	"CN-14173" `	An elderly woman arises from her seat in a deep-set alcove and shuffles out in front of you with a gnarled, wooden walking stick. Despite her weathered skin and obvious age, her eyes are clear as she looks at you with veiled judgment. "You are a long way from home, Captain <last>."`
	"CN-14174" `	"I suppose that is true."`
	"CN-14175" `	She chuckles. "Now, what would bring the infamous war hero all the way to my humble abode?"`
	"CN-14176" `	"I'm looking for Terry Adrianopolous, I believe she might have come here," you answer.`
	"CN-14177" `	"Oh, I know very well who you're looking for, Captain," she says. "My question has more to do with the why."`
	"CN-14178" `	"I need to tie up some loose ends."`
	"CN-14179" `	"I need to know the answer to a question."`
	"CN-14180" `	She shakes her head, "The only loose end here is you."`
	"CN-14181" `	The people in the windows open fire.`
	"CN-14182" `	She stares into your eyes for a few long seconds, and then she bows her head. You think you catch sight of a tear glistening as she turns away. "If you have the means, point your scanners towards Mebsuta from here. Seek out Aspiration."`
	"CN-14183" `	Her voice catches at the end, and she looks back at you from the corner of her eye. "If you have it in your heart to do so, please, do not harm my great-granddaughter."`
	"CN-14184" `	She steps to a doorway and vanishes inside. Within seconds, the windows are closed, the gates are open, and you are left alone in the alley with the bustle of the spaceport beyond.`
	"CN-14185" `Your arrival is unobstructed as you land on this mild, habitable world that appears to be in an advanced, but retreating, ice age. No one comes to greet you at the spaceport, either. As you wander into the single major town, built on a promontory overlooking a wide river mouth, you notice that the people here seem to be happy and the town appears to be remarkably modern. This place has been looked after by someone who knew how to source the necessary import goods to support it on this sparse world of grasses and something resembling pine trees - someone who was Chief of Operations of the Syndicate, for example...`
	"CN-14186" `	You spend about fifteen minutes looking around before a young boy walks up and addresses you. "Hey, stranger sir. I've been asked to tell you that Terry is out on the bluff waiting for you."`
	"CN-14187" `	"How do you know Terry?"`
	"CN-14188" `	"What is this place?"`
	"CN-14189" `	Before you can respond, he's dashed away.`
	"CN-14190" `	When you get out to the bluff, there is a single individual standing on a level section with scrubby grass tufting between bare rock. The city is obscured from here, and you could believe you were isolated from all of civilization. As you approach, it becomes clear the individual is indeed Terry. The wind whips her hair around her constantly, and there is a chill here that is only partly the fault of the wind. Could this one young woman really have been behind all of this trouble, all of this death and suffering, everything that was risked between the Hai and humanity?`
	"CN-14191" `	As you approach, she turns, and you can see she has been crying. "You know you ruined everything," she says. "We were so close." The wind almost steals her last word and you unconsciously step closer to hear her better, causing her to tense.`
	"CN-14192" `	"So close to what?"`
	"CN-14193" `	"To changing everything, to remaking the Syndicate, to creating a whole new political order."`
	"CN-14194" `	She wipes away a tear and visibly steels herself to speak, "I was Alastair's chosen successor, I had already dealt with the competition, a few more years and I'd have been a hero!"`
	"CN-14195" `	She turns slightly and gestures at the sea. "Instead now I'm here, and you get to be the hero, a dumb war hero," her voice rises in pitch and volume, "Never mind a brighter future for humanity!"`
	"CN-14196" `	Her expression seems to be wrestling between fury and despair at this point, "So now what? You here to kill me then?!"`
	"CN-14197" `	"You kidnapped thousands of people. How is that a brighter future?"`
	"CN-14198" `	"Of course you have no idea!" she throws up her hands and expresses a noise of frustration.`
	"CN-14199" `	Her voice drops to a more reasonable level. "I never wanted to kidnap people," Terry says, then lowers her voice even more. "I inherited that legacy..."`
	"CN-14200" `	"You still profited off it, did nothing to stop it," you point out.`
	"CN-14201" `	Your tone had not been accusatory, but merely matter of fact, and yet they seem to have struck her like a sack of bricks. Her composure shatters, and she begins to sob, sinking to her knees and shielding her face from the wind.`
	"CN-14202" `	"It was never meant to be like this," she forces out between sobs. "But the Philosophers were our only resource, and we weren't in control anymore.`
	"CN-14203" `	"We wanted to reform the government, make it better, make it work for the people instead of against them. We dealt with the devil to keep that dream alive. I guess I should have expected it to get us burnt eventually."`
	"CN-14204" `	"Who is 'us?'"`
	"CN-14205" `	She sighs. "My father and I, and a couple of the old survivors of the purge. It's only me left now though, just one Base Principle."`
	"CN-14206" `	You shake your head and ask, "Do you realize you nearly started a war that would have killed millions? Possibly ended human government entirely?"`
	"CN-14207" `	"I know," she says, calm now. "Obviously not my intent, but maybe that would have been better in the long run than the Republic and its corruption. There's no apology appropriate for it, and I can't pretend it would be totally sincere on that front. War changes things; sometimes some pain in the short term is needed for a better future.`
	"CN-14208" `	"The Free Worlds were almost the perfect catalyst, but none of us could have predicted the Pug. Still, that nearly forced Alastair into retirement; it was almost enough. Were it not for the Pug, I would already be running the Syndicate, and there would have been no further risk with the Hai. None of this would have ever happened."`
	"CN-14209" `	Her expression is defiant. "No one would have cared about a few missing people in the world I would have built! It's a necessary sacrifice in the name of progress, and I would've shut down the pirates myself!"`
	"CN-14210" `	"It's always fine to say as much about plans that were never fulfilled."`
	"CN-14211" `	"People would have always had a problem with kidnappings."`
	"CN-14212" `	She gives you a hard stare, but her resolve isn't up to the task for more than a couple seconds. She looks away, and you can see her blinking away more tears. "Is this to be my end, then?" she asks. "Is this the price I pay for my efforts?"`
	"CN-14213" `	"Am I to be judge, jury, and executioner?"`
	"CN-14214" `	(Spare her silently.)`
	"CN-14215" `	(End her wordlessly.)`
	"CN-14216" `	(Spare her.) "There is no other home for you now. Let that be your justice."`
	"CN-14217" `	(End her.) "Justice is the price you pay."`
	"CN-14218" `	(Spare her.) "I've sinned more than you. If people like us decided what is right or wrong, the galaxy would be in cinders."`
	"CN-14219" `	(End her.) "This is for all the trouble you've caused me."`
	"CN-14220" `	(Spare her.) "Consider this my movie review."`
	"CN-14221" `	(End her.) "Consider this my movie review."`
	"CN-14222" `	You draw your weapon and point it at her, your thumb on the safety. When you look inside yourself, though, you cannot bring yourself to be her executioner.`
	"CN-14223" `	The holster clicks as you put the weapon away.`
	"CN-14224" `	You draw your weapon and point it at her, your thumb on the safety. Some prices are too high to pay for a better future.`
	"CN-14225" `	The retort of the weapon is taken away on the wind.`
	"CN-14226" `	"You'd better be," she says. "You and I both know that this can't become public. If you take me to the Syndicate they will do away with me if they find out, and I doubt they could manage to not."`
	"CN-14227" `	"Oh, Moray told me to say you're fired if you don't get back quickly... that was over a week ago now," you tell her.`
	"CN-14228" `	She rolls her eyes. "Of course, this is exactly the sort of callous governance I expect of them.`
	"CN-14229" `	"Don't distract from the point though. I can never go back. You're the only one who knows everything, and no one else can know it all. Taking me back is a guarantee that I'll be 'disappeared' - you might as well pull the trigger yourself. You must decide here, now, how this ends.`
	"CN-14230" `	"You are the judge, whether you like it or not, and no one else will carry out your judgment."`
	"CN-14231" `	You return to your ship. You're done here.`
	"CN-14232" `When you return to <planet>, you reassure Sayari and Xilin that there is nothing more to do. The danger is over, for good.`
	"CN-14233" `	As it happens, the summit has functionally concluded by the time you return. In fact, diplomats had been running interference to prolong things, knowing that your return could potentially have critical consequences. Now that you're here, the remaining agenda items miraculously get resolved within hours, and late in the day, you find yourself once again "Where Mountains Touch The Sky," as the successful resolution is announced.`
	"CN-14234" `	The historic moment lays the groundwork for a future official treaty framework and governmental cooperation, as well as establishing <planet> as the principle diplomatic embassy for both peoples. Less publicly, extensive surveillance fleets are posted on both sides of the wormhole to detect any kidnappings or other illegal travel. Now, the only way for illicit transfers to happen is if a government employee is involved, but all three countries have quietly agreed to watch for that behavior and punish it severely.`
	"CN-14235" `	At last, it really is over, and you can get back to your own life.`
	"CN-14236" `	Maybe you'll have to find out who the Unfettered were stealing their other technologies from. They mentioned another group: the "Wanderers."`
	"CN-14237" `When you land at the spaceport, you find a message waiting for you from Teneep in the system buffer.`
	"CN-14238" `	The message has traveled a very long way and filtered through a great many relays to reach you, but it is nice that you can safely send messages across the wormhole now.`
	"CN-14239" `	The content of the message is very simple. The Hai-human treaty, which both peoples' governments resolved to work on, has reached its final stages of drafting and acceptance. Apparently there's something they want you to assist with to get it over the line. They'll be waiting for you on <destination> when you're ready.`
	"CN-14240" `Upon arriving at <planet>, you are greeted by Mr. Xilin Yang and the Hai ambassador, Hiyamaharu.`
	"CN-14241" `	"Captain <last>!" enthuses Xilin. "It has been too long. Welcome to <planet> again."`
	"CN-14242" `	Around you, the station appears to be prospering. A strong undercurrent of excited anticipation that seems to buoy everyone along as they go about their business.`
	"CN-14243" `	"Hiyamaharu here has been telling me stories about these so-called 'Wanderers' you've been off gallivanting with." He gives you a wink and a nudge, then continues, "I don't think he was meant to tell me, but it slipped out when I said we'd asked you back for this. I hear you two have been briefly acquainted before?"`
	"CN-14244" `	"Yes, we met briefly over some business with Alphas."`
	"CN-14245" `	"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I don't recall the occasion."`
	"CN-14246" `	Hiyamaharu looks hurt for a moment, but quickly saves face. "Not to worry, I'm sure the famous Captain has a great many adventures to recall. A short chat with an old Hai is no offense to have forgotten."`
	"CN-14247" `	Hiyamaharu looks faintly pleased that you remember him. "Yes, that is quite right, I'm only sorry I wasn't able to offer more assistance at the time."`
	"CN-14248" `	Xilin looks shocked. "The Alphas? Seriously? Will there never be an end to their tale?"`
	"CN-14249" `	He waves his hand dismissively and continues.`
	"CN-14250" `	"In any event," Xilin continues, "Hiyamaharu and I would like you to do something. You completed a similar task when this station was first built.`
	"CN-14251" `	"The pirate threat to ships traveling to and from Hai space is just as bad as it ever was, possibly worse for the increased number of ships. So, on top of a mountain of legalese, an endless stipulation of trade obligations, and a nightmare of judicial jurisprudence jurisdiction boundaries, there is a very physical and tangible action that needs to be taken.`
	"CN-14252" `	"The Navy base on Farpoint helps to limit the mobility of pirates coming from the Far North, but there is no restraint other than distance to put a check on the pirates that come out of Stormhold. Something needs to be done to secure the space lanes, and so the solution that has been agreed upon is to build a station in Cardax. The volume of pirate activity there is intense enough that the Hai's rapid ship conversion approach to building a station is the only really viable approach."`
	"CN-14253" `	"So what am I going to do?"`
	"CN-14254" `	"Well," says Hiyamaharu, "the number of ships involved in this represents a considerable investment, and we'd hate for them to be destroyed during a vulnerable construction phase. The prior concerns about human agents observing the inner core of the station also continue to apply.`
	"CN-14255" `	"So, we would like you to escort a security force and the core Geocoris to the site in Cardax, clear out any threats in the system, and get the ship through the first construction phase so it can safely raise its shield again. Once that has been completed, the rest of the Geocoris will travel with their escort to join you. You and the security force will have to protect the station while the rest of the convoy arrives to finish the construction."`
	"CN-14256" `"Why not just send all of them with their entire escort at once? Surely that would be safer?"`
	"CN-14257" `	Xilin shrugs. "We've heard a rumor that the pirates might have caught wind of what we're doing. The reality is that the marauders up here can field a truly formidable force, if they get their act together. They've overrun the Navy outpost on Farpoint a number of times before, and it would be devastating if an entire naval flotilla, the Hai construction fleet, and a whole security force were all caught out in the open by such a fleet, possibly attacked from both sides.`
	"CN-14258" `	"By separating them, we're less likely to tip them off as to when exactly we choose to act, and once the station is up, the fleet can use the station's projector and facilities to support their presence. Plus, if they are tipped off already and we can't deal with them, then we only lose the one Geocoris. We expect that you and the Hai security ships are capable enough to escape from trouble if it's more than you can handle."`
	"CN-14259" `	"Makes sense."`
	"CN-14260" `	"I suppose..."`
	"CN-14261" `	"The Geocoris and security force are ready whenever you are. Be safe out there <last>, and remember: we can't have any pirates observing the construction."`
	"CN-14262" `While the system is clear of threats for a moment, you supervise closely as the Geocoris unfolds and deploys a massive, metal structural ring, before shifting hull plates and having its innards rearranged into a shielded station core. When the shield is back up, a confirmation message comes from Mountaintop. The rest of the construction fleet is en route.`
	"CN-14263" `	Now, you just need to keep the pirates away from the nascent station core until they can get here. The message from Mountaintop also warned that there may be a hasty response from the pirates.`
	"CN-14264" `With a strong force ensuring that no one can interrupt the final construction stage, space-based cranes set about removing the three outer sections of the Geocoris and moving them to the steel ring deployed around the original station core. Within a few hours, all seven of the new Geocoris have been dismantled and integrated to the station structure, using lessons learnt from the construction of Mountaintop to rapidly finish a station that is fully battle-ready, if lacking in some of the amenities of life. In an unexpected reversal of the Mountaintop priorities, the construction workers unpack and assemble a massive holoprojector while wearing environmental suits before they begin unpacking the contents of the Geocoris storage pods and engaging principle life support systems.`
	"CN-14265" `	As soon as the life support systems around the docking section are engaged, the security ships begin landing those damaged by the hastily assembled pirate response for critical repairs.`
	"CN-14266" `	As you're attending to your own ships after their extended guard duty, you get pinged by a hail from Mountaintop. When you answer it, you are greeted by Xilin and Hiyamaharu, who look very pleased. "We hear that the operation to establish Mooncreek has been successful, Captain <last>! How'd things go with you?"`
	"CN-14267" `	"Yeah, it was fairly chill."`
	"CN-14268" `	"It was very close out there. There were some losses."`
	"CN-14269" `	Hiyamaharu is inscrutable, but Xilin adopts a somber expression. "Unfortunately, there was always a risk of that in such an endeavor."`
	"CN-14270" `	"Still," says Hiyamaharu, turning to Xilin.`
	"CN-14271" `	"A great success all round," replies Xilin. "The Republic and Hai governments have approved a reward of <payment> by the way, as thanks for your considerable assistance here.`
	"CN-14272" `	"If you have a moment though, we'd appreciate your continued help with a bit of PR now. To finalize the new station, the plan is to facilitate the setup of some of the major outfitters, both from Hai space and from ours. Predominantly, this would be so that we can ensure a ready supply of munitions on the station at all times. As well, a long-term garrison to act as security needs to be established. We'd like you to escort each of them on the last leg of their journeys, mostly for the photo ops.`
	"CN-14273" `	"Of course," Xilin adds, "we'll understand if you're too busy now."`
	"CN-14274" `	"I think I've had enough of the limelight for now."`
	"CN-14275" `	Xilin performs a combination shrug and half-nod. "Fair enough <last>, be safe out there. We'll send you an invite for the final treaty ceremony. We'd all like you to be there."`
	"CN-14276" `	The call ends, leaving you to your own devices.`
	"CN-14277" `	"Lovely. In that case, the first convoy will be waiting for you on <destination>. I'll meet you there on <origin> when you return."`
	"CN-14278" `When you arrive on <origin>, you are greeted by a representative of Lovelace Labs. They and their Navy escort are ready to depart on their PR flight immediately.`
	"CN-14279" `The Republic garrison and Lovelace transports arrive to suitable fanfare and media pomp. Xilin and Hiyamaharu appear to have hitched a ride to Mooncreek in your absence, and they greet you in what passes for a spaceport that is not yet even serving drinks.`
	"CN-14280" `	"Good job out there, <last>," says Xilin.`
	"CN-14281" `	"I know it's trivial, but don't underestimate the impact of a stately arrival. After the crisis last time, it's really very important to penetrate the public consciousness and get people to appreciate the magnitude of these steps."`
	"CN-14282" `	"As long as I get paid for it."`
	"CN-14283" `	Xilin nods. "The Syndicate cohort will be waiting on Sunracer for the next one." He casts a look around. "With any luck, you'll actually be able to get a drink around here by the time you return."`
	"CN-14284" `When you arrive on Sunracer, you are greeted by a Syndicate representative. They appear agitated by the delay and are ready to depart on their PR flight immediately.`
	"CN-14285" `The Syndicate convoy arrives to a more muted reception, but one that is thoroughly covered nonetheless. The rudimentary spaceport, still only days old, has now opened up a bar, and the Lovelace outfitters have begun work on their facilities here. Hiyamaharu is waiting for you in the spaceport and appears to be sampling a collection of cheap whiskies.`
	"CN-14286" `	"Welcome back, Captain," he says, "If you don't mind, I'll be coming with you for the Hai escort."`
	"CN-14287" `	"This seems mildly ridiculous."`
	"CN-14288" `	"I hear the intent of this affair is to prevent the news cycle in human space from turning over before the big event," he explains.`
	"CN-14289" `	"Well," you say, "at least I don't have to go very far."`
	"CN-14290" `The Hai on Mountaintop are fully prepared. Everyone is eager to get this part over and done with.`
	"CN-14291" `On your arrival to <origin> with the Hai convoy, you are surprised to see a slightly put-out looking Alondo waiting for you at the docks.`
	"CN-14292" `	"<first>! How's it going?"`
	"CN-14293" `	"Fine, I guess?"`
	"CN-14294" `	"It's going well."`
	"CN-14295" `	"Good, good," he says. "Now, I know that the last thing you probably want to do right now is traipse from one end of space to the other, but I need to ask you a favor."`
	"CN-14296" `	He finds somewhere to sit down with you and begins. "You may recall that I was helping the Free Worlds set up their diplomatic corps. Obviously, I wanted no part of the ambassadorial business to the Republic, but when all this Hai business started up well, let's just say they struggled to find anyone qualified. As it turns out, someone in the senate doesn't particularly like me, and they've been using my extended time away up here to try and influence the diplomatic corps. Meanwhile, the Hai want the Free Worlds to have some involvement with this station we're on so that everyone is tied in, but obviously the Free Worlds don't particularly care when they could hardly be further from it.`
	"CN-14297" `	"I have devised a compromise: the Free Worlds will not supply ships to the garrison, but they will instead sponsor both Kraz and Delta V, primarily based in the south, to set up outfitters here, with full upfront costs paid by the Free Worlds government. A defining success will allow me to return to the corps with the influence I need to counter this senator's influence. Otherwise, I fear I shall be stuck here, on the other side of space, for the rest of my career."`
	"CN-14298" `	You look at your friend, and you can tell he's waiting for you to accept his premise first, holding something back...`
	"CN-14299" `	"What's the catch?"`
	"CN-14300" `	He chuckles. "You're getting to know me too well.`
	"CN-14301" `	"The catch is that the Free Worlds will only sponsor the outfitters if you agree to escort their convoys directly from Solace and Rust the entire way here. They want to make a big show of it - or rather, a certain senator has goaded them into making a show of it."`
	"CN-14302" `	He sighs. "On the plus side though, if you're interested, you do get paid diplomatic escort rates."`
	"CN-14303" `	"I'll do it, friend."`
	"CN-14304" `	"Of course I'll do it, but how much is that exactly?"`
	"CN-14305" `	He winks. "A hundred thousand credits per day, for a fifty-two-day route with eight stops."`
	"CN-14306" `	"Of course, if you really don't want to do it, I'll understand. I don't imagine you're keen to deal with the politics."`
	"CN-14307" `	You take a moment to consider helping a good friend... for six million credits.`
	"CN-14308" `	"Don't be silly! Of course I'll do it, friend."`
	"CN-14309" `	"I'm sorry Alondo. Maybe I can find some other way of helping you later."`
	"CN-14310" `When you arrive on Solace, the Delta V convoy is ready and waiting along with one of their head engineers. They also seem to have sent their most blustery and arrogant sales representative, much to the chagrin of their engineer. Fortunately for everyone, they will each be traveling on separate ships, and not on yours.`
	"CN-14311" `On <origin>, it is tempting to take the time to go and catch up with Barmy Edward, but the Kraz convoy were already prepared a day early and near enough to meeting you in orbit.`
	"CN-14312" `	While you are briefly touched down though, you are greeted by a message from Alondo. "<first>! Navy intelligence has, in their infinite wisdom, deigned to let us know about a potential pirate threat. The marauders were outmaneuvered when <planet> went up so quickly, so it seems they might attempt to intercept the convoy. Please be safe out there!"`
	"CN-14313" `	It seems you'll have to keep your eyes peeled on your way back.`
	"CN-14314" `In your absence the Mooncreek station has been fully completed. You are summoned to Mountaintop for the final treaty signing.`
	"CN-14315" `With the Free World outfitters safely at Mooncreek, there's nothing left except to go to Mountaintop for the treaty signing. Alondo hitches a ride and transfers you the <payment> promised by the Free Worlds.`
	"CN-14316" `Arriving on <origin> once again brings with it full diplomatic regalia. The gallery "Where Mountains Touch The Sky" is filled to the brim with a great many representatives from the Core and Paradise worlds, and some of the more notable representatives from the Syndicate and Free Worlds. The entire Hai Elder Council is in attendance, and the Chancellor of the Free Worlds and President of the Republic are again schmoozing about in their most respectable suits. Alondo, Xilin, and Hiyamaharu have their symbols of office, and it looks like the Free Worlds have now finalized their design for Alondo's.`
	"CN-14317" `	The speeches in the grand Borealis Chamber turn out to be rather long and dry. Teeneep makes an appearance along with one of the other Elder Hai, whom you think you recognize as the one who asked you strange questions once before. Only the Republic President makes a head of state address, but the highest officer of the Navy also makes an address on the value of the Mooncreek station to the security of both nations and the benefits of long-term cooperation with mutual friends.`
	"CN-14318" `	You are asked to stand for a great many photos, make occasional comments, and shake an absolutely endless series of hands. Xilin is kind enough to make sure you get some of the better hors d'oeuvres in between exchanging pleasantries.`
	"CN-14319" `	When it's over, Xilin and Hiyamaharu quietly inform you that you have a reward of <payment> for your earlier efforts setting up Mooncreek. You're free to go back about your business now.`
	"CN-14320" `"Benga" Reverse Thruster`
	"CN-14321" `This planet is populated by a hostile alien species that resembles giant, intelligent squirrels. Although despite their hostility while in orbit, they pay little mind to you on the surface. Do you want to approach one of them?`
	"CN-14322" `	(Not now, it's too risky.)`
	"CN-14323" `This planet is populated by a hostile alien species that resembles giant, intelligent squirrels. Their ships look exactly like the ones that you saw on the news. Although despite their hostility while in orbit, they pay little mind to you on the surface.`
	"CN-14324" `	You catch the eye of one of the alien dock workers and it walks over. "Ah," it says, "the monkey is curious. The monkey has never been face to face with a true Hai before?"`
	"CN-14325" `	"Hai? Is that what you call yourselves?"`
	"CN-14326" `	"What do you mean, 'true Hai'?"`
	"CN-14327" `	"Why did you shoot at me? Are you at war?"`
	"CN-14328" `The Hai here appear to be at war with the rest of their species. Do you want to approach one of them and ask why?`
	"CN-14329" `	You catch the eye of one of the Hai dock workers and they walk over. "Ah," they say, "the monkey is curious. The monkey has never been face to face with a true Hai before?"`
	"CN-14330" `	"No, I've encountered many of your brethren south of here."`
	"CN-14331" `	"Why are you at war with everyone else?"`
	"CN-14332" `	They hiss. "They are not true Hai. We are Hai. The unaltered. We were masters of a hundred worlds before human monkeys had learned the use of thumbs."`
	"CN-14333" `	"It means that we are unaltered, Hai as Hai were first born to be. Hai the conquerors. We were masters of a hundred worlds before human monkeys had learned the use of thumbs."`
	"CN-14334" `	"We are Hai. Hai the conquerors. We were masters of a hundred worlds before human monkeys had learned the use of thumbs."`
	"CN-14335" `	"We fight to defend ourselves from extinction," they say.`
	"CN-14336" `	"Extinction?" you ask. "Do you mean that there are no other Hai?"`
	"CN-14337" `	"We are all that is left of the original Hai," they say. "Unaltered. The conquerors. We were masters of a hundred worlds before human monkeys had learned the use of thumbs."`
	"CN-14338" `	"Extinction?" you ask. "Do you mean that you are not the same species as the other Hai?"`
	"CN-14339" `	"Indeed," they say. "We are all that is left of the original Hai. Unaltered. The conquerors. We were masters of a hundred worlds before human monkeys had learned the use of thumbs."`
	"CN-14340" `	"Where was your territory? Why have I never heard of you before?"`
	"CN-14341" `	"What do you mean, the Hai were altered?"`
	"CN-14342" `	"This is our story," they say. "Once, many worlds beyond wormhole were ours. Once, hundred thousand years now gone. We needed more worlds. A species that does not expand becomes like brackish water, like stunted tree. But dragonfolk in the south had created hyperdrive, and human monkeys had begun banging rocks together in what the Drak said was very intelligent fashion. So we were forbidden from taking more worlds."`
	"CN-14343" `	"'Dragonfolk?'" you ask. "I've never heard of them."`
	"CN-14344" `	"Sheragi," they say, "they are extinct. Only their dumb ancestors survive, just as monkeys will outlast the thinking humans."`
	"CN-14345" `	"'Dragonfolk?'" you ask. "Do you mean the Sheragi?"`
	"CN-14346" `	"Impressive," they reply, "the monkey knows of Sheragi. We outlived them all. Funny that only their dumb ancestors survive, just as monkeys will outlast the thinking humans."`
	"CN-14347" `	"How were you altered?" you ask.`
	"CN-14348" `	They say, "We Hai fought Sheragi and took worlds that Drak said belonged to them, worlds that Sheragi had not yet even discovered. Drak retaliated. On all Hai worlds, Drak ships appeared in orbit. Sickness swept each planet: quick fever, strange feeling of frailness, like you are brittle bones with mouth full of dirt. Victims left alive, but all ambition gone, no desire but to die of comfortable old age."`
	"CN-14349" `	"Did you try to resist the Drak?"`
	"CN-14350" `	"How do you know this, if it happened a hundred thousand years ago?"`
	"CN-14351" `	"Silly monkey," they say, "none can resist. They are strong. Their will prevails. And their will is for the galaxy to be a zoo, little remnants of each species all in separate cages. For now they let humans run free so humans will grow in knowledge, but soon they will fashion a cage for humans too."`
	"CN-14352" `	"All Hai know. The story is passed down. Others tell an altered version, where the way of peace was choice and not an inflicted wound, but some in each generation learn truth, and join us here."`
	"CN-14353" `	"That is a frightening story. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me."`
	"CN-14354" `	"Is there anything I can do to help you?"`
	"CN-14355" `	"If you are ever willing to sell us a jump drive," they say, "we will richly reward you. And if you discover the secret of how we can construct our own jump drives and escape from this prison, bring it to us and you will live as a god among us."`
	"CN-14356" `	"I'm sorry, I don't know the secret of the jump drive. No human being does."`
	"CN-14357" `	"If I ever have an extra jump drive to sell, I will bring it to you."`
	"CN-14358" `	"Then leave us alone," they say, and they walk off.`
	"CN-14359" `	"Bring us a jump drive," they say, "and we will count you among our friends. Bring us more, and we may even consider you worthy of a share of the plunder, when we take back what is ours."`
	"CN-14360" `The Unfettered have clearly noticed that you have a jump drive; a large crowd of them has gathered around your ship. Do you want to talk with them, and perhaps arrange a sale of your jump drive?`
	"CN-14361" `	As soon as you approach the crowd, one of them steps forward and says, "One million credits, and the friendship of the true Hai people. This is our offer, for the jump drive."`
	"CN-14362" `	"Sure, I will accept that deal."`
	"CN-14363" `	"Can you offer me more than that?"`
	"CN-14364" `	"How will my ship leave here without my jump drive?"`
	"CN-14365" `	"We can give you a hyperdrive in its place, if required," they say, "and you will be counted as our friend, so you will not need to leave here quickly, or under threat of violence." You can't help but wonder if they will try to take your ship by force if you do not agree to the deal.`
	"CN-14366" `	"Oh, and by the way, you will no longer be required to keep your Anomalocaris in working condition to guarantee our friendship," they add.`
	"CN-14367" `	"Okay, I accept your generous offer."`
	"CN-14368" `	"Sorry, but if I give you this jump drive, I will lose my ability to capture more of them. Be patient, and I will bring you several of them when I am able."`
	"CN-14369" `	They ponder this for a while, and says, "Very well. Our offer stands, whenever you choose to return." They allow you to return to your ship peacefully.`
	"CN-14370" `	"Do not underestimate the value of our friendship," they say. "Soon we will become powerful once more, with many fruitful worlds under our control, and when that day comes you will benefit greatly from being our ally."`
	"CN-14371" `	"Okay, as long as you give me a hyperdrive to take its place, I'll give you my jump drive."`
	"CN-14372" `	"You can take the jump drive, but I don't need a hyperdrive in exchange."`
	"CN-14373" `	The Unfettered engineers quickly and carefully remove your jump drive and replace it with an ordinary hyperdrive. You sincerely hope that you are not making a mistake by giving them this new technology. "Remember," one of them says as they hand you your payment, "when you acquire more jump drives, return here with them and we will give you further rewards. Until then, may fortune favor you, human friend."`
	"CN-14374" `	The Unfettered engineers quickly retrieve the jump drive. You sincerely hope that you are not making a mistake by giving them this new technology. "Remember," one of them says as they hand you your payment, "when you acquire more jump drives, return here with them and we will give you further rewards. Until then, may fortune favor you, human friend."`
	"CN-14375" `As before, when you land on this Unfettered world with a jump drive, a large crowd gathers around your ship. Clearly they are hoping that once again you will arrange a sale. Do you want to bargain with them?`
	"CN-14376" `	When you approach the crowd, one of them says, "Greetings, human friend. We have made you known to all our brothers and sisters as one of the few creatures who have chosen to help the true Hai to gain their freedom. If you give us another jump drive, we will pay you another million credits, and make you one of our emissaries to collect the payments with which our frail brothers seek to buy peace. Will you accept this exchange?"`
	"CN-14377" `	"Sorry, I need this jump drive right now, but I will come back later and sell it to you."`
	"CN-14378" `	"Yes, I will sell you my jump drive."`
	"CN-14379" `	Once again, they swap your jump drive for a hyperdrive, and pay you far more than you could sell a jump drive for anywhere else. "We will tell the other true Hai to offer you jobs in our job boards," they tell you, "and remember that we need still more jump drives."`
	"CN-14380" `	"Then I will find more, and bring them to you."`
	"CN-14381" `	"Can you tell me what you are using them for?"`
	"CN-14382" `	"Not yet. If you further prove your friendship, perhaps we will." You assure them that you will continue to do your best to assist them.`
	"CN-14383" `You have another jump drive, and the Unfettered will certainly be willing to pay you well for it. They also hinted that they might be willing to give you more information about what they plan to use the jump drives for. Do you want to sell them another drive?`
	"CN-14384" `	You meet up with some local Unfettered leaders, and they again pay you a million credits and arrange for your jump drive to be swapped out of your ship. "If you bring more, we will continue to pay you," they say.`
	"CN-14385" `	"Can you tell me what you are using the jump drives for?"`
	"CN-14386" `	"Thank you, I will certainly bring more of them when I am able."`
	"CN-14387" `	After a brief and hushed discussion in their own language, one of the leaders says, "You have proven your worth, so we will share our secret. The Hai once owned many worlds on the galactic fringe, a territory we can only visit using the jump drive. Those worlds are fruitful and nearly uninhabited. We will reclaim them as our own, and there will be food there to feed the Unfettered for many thousands of years to come."`
	"CN-14388" `	"Is there any other way I can help you to reclaim those worlds?"`
	"CN-14389" `	"'Nearly uninhabited?' You mean another species inhabits some of those worlds now?"`
	"CN-14390" `	You suspect that they are talking about the territory that is now inhabited by the Wanderers.`
	"CN-14391" `	"Are you at war with the Wanderers? Can I help you to reclaim your territory?"`
	"CN-14392" `	"What are you going to do to the species that owns those worlds right now?"`
	"CN-14393" `	"Your help may indeed be beneficial to us," says the leader. "I will tell the others to contact you if they have any particular missions you can undertake."`
	"CN-14394" `	"I look forward to hearing from them."`
	"CN-14395" `	"What do you plan to do to the species that inhabits those worlds now?"`
	"CN-14396" `	"Those worlds are now held by a species of scavengers, who feast on the ruin of proud civilizations. Our scouts tell us that these carrion-feeders have wiped away nearly every Hai artifact, melting down our cities to make metal for their ships and factories, and hiding the scars of our wars beneath newly planted forests. They are an old and strong species, but few in number, and those worlds are ours by right."`
	"CN-14397" `	You try to press them for more information, but they tell you nothing useful, aside from promising you that they will seek out your help when it is time to reclaim their territory.`
	"CN-14398" `	"If you want to provide us with more jump drives, visit the job board from now on," says the leader. "We will have warriors ready to receive them from you for the usual pay."`
	"CN-14399" `As you exit your ship to head to the spaceport you see that an Unfettered Hai<hood> is waiting for you at your hatch.`
	"CN-14400" `	As you get closer you surmise it is an engineer, judging by the writing pad and equipment they have. Maybe they mean to trade something other than money with you. Do you want to bargain for another drive with them?`
	"CN-14401" `	They probably mean to offer the same deal of exchanging jump drives for weapons as before. Do you want to try and see if you can prove yourself worthy this time, and bargain for a jump drive?`
	"CN-14402" `	As soon as you set foot on the world the supposed engineer drops her equipment and throws a blade at you just like before - it seems that she does not want to waste time with you anymore.`
	"CN-14403" `	You exit your ship, but before you can even reach the engineer, another Unfettered shouts to attract your attention and then throws a blade at you, without any other warning or ceremony.`
	"CN-14404" `	You exit your ship and immediately the engineer leads you to the outfitter. "We have weapons to show you for your assistance in providing us with jump drives. For now you will only be allowed to trade for the one, but if you continue to provide assistance to us, you may prove yourself worthy to access the others." They never stop to ask if you are actually interested in new weapons.`
	"CN-14405" `	"I'm not really interested in Hai weapons."`
	"CN-14406" `	"I don't really want to do this right now."`
	"CN-14407" `	"How rude. You better hope there will be someone else to guide you next time!" says the engineer as you return to your ship.`
	"CN-14408" `	"These are not standard Hai weapons, Captain, trust me. Also, it would be ill-advised to judge before seeing them, would it not?"`
	"CN-14409" `	They lead you through the usual outfitter but then go to an area you have never noticed before, probably because you were not meant to. As you are about to pass through what you assume to be a security check, an Unfettered throws a blade at your face!`
	"CN-14410" `	You recognize the same Unfettered from last time; she must fancy throwing blades at people.`
	"CN-14411" `	(Try to dodge it.)`
	"CN-14412" `	(Leap to the side and use my own weapon.)`
	"CN-14413" `	(Flee.)`
	"CN-14414" `	You leap to the side, grabbing your own weapon just in time to threaten the Unfettered that threw the blade at you. Seeming a bit surprised by your unconventional tactics, they lower their own weapon. "Well done! In truth, there is no higher honor than surviving on the field of battle, because only then can you bring loot back to those who need it! A tactic is only good if you can find and execute it quickly enough to give you an edge, which you did. <learned>I am Desneeparu, and it is my pleasure to meet you, Captain."`
	"CN-14415" `	You manage to grab the weapon, just in time to deflect an incoming attack from the same Unfettered. They duel with you for what feels like an eternity. At first you are astonished by the fact you have managed to survive this long, but you soon realize that, as you have not managed to land a single successful blow, this must be some kind of deliberate test.`
	"CN-14416" `	Then, suddenly, you can feel the pace of your opponent change; the game is over. They strike a masterful blow that disarms you with ease before smiling and lowering their weapon. "It looks like you know what to do with a blade! <learned>I am Desneeparu, and it is a pleasure to meet you, Captain <last>!" she exclaims, before laughing at your surprised face. You realize she must have been toying with you from the beginning, but, nevertheless, she seems satisfied by your performance.`
	"CN-14417" `	She does some kind of salute with her fist before leaving. "I must go now. I hope you will find the weapon you need."`
	"CN-14418" `	<The engineer> proceeds to take you underground to rows and rows of prototype weapons, some of which are being worked on by engineers. They explain, "We prefer to do most of our testing on the field of battle. We only make the most basic safety tests here before Unfettered captains can get their hands on them. They often start by going to Firelode to put the weapon to its limit, to ensure it will not explode in the middle of action. The more interest in a prototype, the more we develop it." You keep walking until you enter the outfitter section of the facility, where you notice the items on display are much more advanced than anything you have seen available on the surface: so much so it could almost pass for a 'normal' Hai outfitter, were it not for the overcharged, oppressive feel of the testing grounds.`
	"CN-14419" `	"Welcome to the advanced section of the outfitter, Captain! It is only for our most distinguished guests. Now that you have sold us multiple jump drives, I can tell you that we offer something much more valuable than money. For now, I can only offer you the mighty Tripulse Shredder, but eventually we will give you access to all kinds of weapons. Two Tripulse Shredders and our sympathy for one jump drive is the deal I propose," they say, presenting the weapons to you. Now that you can take a closer look, you notice these weapons seem fairly similar to other Hai weaponry, but they are enhanced in one way or another. Alongside the Tripulses you can spot what look like a very small Ion Cannon and an Ion Cannon mounted turret.`
	"CN-14420" `	"Tell me more about those Tripulse Shredders I can buy."`
	"CN-14421" `	"I'll settle for the tripulse, then."`
	"CN-14422" `	"Can you tell me more about that small ionic weapon?"`
	"CN-14423" `	"I'd like to learn about this... ion cannon mounted on a turret?"`
	"CN-14424" `	"I would just prefer the money, actually."`
	"CN-14425" `	"Ah, the Blaster. It is favored by many Shield Beetle captains, because it can easily help them turn the tide of battle without needing to dedicate too much weapon space to it. Especially considering its other effects, its damage potential is serviceable. While it is true that it does not do enough ion damage to properly disable a ship on its own, it is able to jam their weapons and will give you the upper hand in a long fight. This is a more recent innovation, however, and some say it lacks the... finesse of others.`
	"CN-14426" `	"That is my preferred weapon out of all of them, by far. Unlike the Ion Cannon that is a hybrid weapon meant to damage the enemy from long range whilst applying a good deal of ionization, this one's role is mostly to disable enemy ships. Even a ship with many batteries will cower before this weapon! And due to its high range and fast turn-rate, small ships and even fighters will never bother you again!`
	"CN-14427" `	"However, we only have these weapons in very limited quantities, and as such we cannot afford to give these to you yet. So, about my offer, have you made up your mind?"`
	"CN-14428" `	"Oh. Well, in that case, we will not bother you again with this weapon, or any other, Captain, here or in the job board."`
	"CN-14429" `	"Wait, what was that weapon again?"`
	"CN-14430" `	"As you wish. Do remember that if you want to sell further jump drives to us for money you may go to the job board."`
	"CN-14431" `	"The Tripulse Shredder may seem crude, but it packs a punch! Its specialty is how it combines a lot of firepower in one gun slot, and, due to its burst nature, it's perfect for pilots who already use hit and run tactics. Some captains even say that a Sea Scorpion can get the upper hand against a Shield Beetle when it uses four of them, if you know what you're doing, of course! As I said, I may offer you two of these in exchange for your jump drive."`
	"CN-14432" `	They order their crew to do the transfer and come to address you before leaving. "Do note that if you ever want more weapons, we will always be willing to trade them for jump drives in the job board. However, we can always offer money instead if that is of higher value to you. Of course, we can only do this exchange here on <origin>, given it is where these advanced weapons are produced and stocked."`
	"CN-14433" `	The engineer leaves and you return to your ship after being escorted out of the facility.`
	"CN-14434" `	<as before (run)> manage to dodge the blade but are then left defenseless when the same Unfettered closes with another one and slashes down to strike. They stop at the last possible moment, dissatisfaction clear on their face.`
	"CN-14435" `	"So this is how you 'fight,' Captain? You hide? You dodge? You refuse to seize our weapons, so you will not have them."`
	"CN-14436" `	<as before (flee)> run away from the blade without any difficulty, but the Hai that threw it catches up to you in mere seconds and immobilizes you with their blade on your throat.`
	"CN-14437" `	"You disappoint me, Captain. In battle it is of great importance that you identify your advantages over the enemy and not show weakness by running, else they will come in for the kill. You have failed in both ways here. Never would you have been able to outrun me. All you did was show fear."`
	"CN-14438" `	"You really keep on disappointing me, Captain. At one time you tried to avoid a fight you could not flee from, and the other to dodge a weapon that was so readily presented to you? Maybe you truly are no warrior and let most of your subordinates do the dirty work."`
	"CN-14439" `	"I will not keep on teaching you the same lesson! You had your chance. We cannot accept one that does not learn from their mistakes. It seems that we cannot trust you with our most advanced weapons." She then leaves, visibly irritated.`
	"CN-14440" `	<leave> The engineer, who had watched the fight then explains, "Since you have failed the test we cannot give you access to our vault yet. Our weapons are only meant for the most capable of warriors. You will of course still be able to trade jump drives for money, but until you otherwise prove yourself, that is the extent of it."`
	"CN-14441" `	"This mistake is not permanent; I am sure she will happily forgive you, if you will only bring us more jump drives. Another engineer will be waiting for you at your hatch when that is the case."`
	"CN-14442" `	"In fact, your reputation for bringing us jump drives is so great she has no choice but to forgive you in the near future. Another engineer will be waiting for you at your hatch when that is the case."`
	"CN-14443" `As usual, the Unfettered are more than willing to pay you a million credits for your jump drive, but you do not gain any additional information by talking with them.`
	"CN-14444" `The Unfettered's usual deal of trading a jump drive for weapons still stands.`
	"CN-14445" `	(Take two Tripulse Shredders.)`
	"CN-14446" `	(Take money instead.)`
	"CN-14447" `	The two Shredders are loaded onto your ship, in exchange for your jump drive.`
	"CN-14448" `During the night, you hear a gentle scratching sound on your ship's main hatch. Do you investigate?`
	"CN-14449" `	You grab a flashlight and open the hatch, and find a juvenile Hai there, with a large satchel slung over his shoulder. "You are the <first> <last>, yes?" he says. You nod. He says, "Is it true what is written here?"`
	"CN-14450" `	In his hands he is holding a piece of foil paper. You recognize it as the wrapper from one of the food rations that you have been transporting to the Unfettered, the "tribute" that they demand from the peaceful Hai. But having never unwrapped one of the rations, you had not realized that there is writing on the inside, a few words in the angular alphabet of the Hai. The Unfettered youth sees your look of confusion, and translates the message. "It says, 'Hai-home is your home too. Rejoin your people.'"`
	"CN-14451" `	"I think it is true. The Hai who gave this tribute said they hoped the Unfettered would turn from violence and be reconciled with them."`
	"CN-14452" `	"I'm sorry, but I don't think they will ever let you live among them, if it is your nature to be prone to violence."`
	"CN-14453" `	You have little experience reading Hai emotions, but the youth seems crestfallen. "You are certain?" he asks.`
	"CN-14454" `	"I am certain. I can do nothing for you."`
	"CN-14455" `	"Perhaps you can come with me and find out, but don't get your hopes up."`
	"CN-14456" `	"Will you take me to Hai-home?" he asks. "You are able to be outside Unfettered places. Can I go with you?"`
	"CN-14457" `	"Yes, I will take you there."`
	"CN-14458" `	"Sorry, I can't risk angering the Unfettered by carrying a defector."`
	"CN-14459" `	Disappointed, the youth leaves. You hope you made the right choice.`
	"CN-14460" `	You show the youth to one of your bunk rooms, and tell him to stay hidden there until you reach Hai-home.`
	"CN-14461" `You need not have worried about the reception the Unfettered youth would receive here on Hai-home. Scarcely minutes after you hesitantly contact the Hai government, a happy crowd has gathered around your ship. When he steps out of the hatchway, he looks stunned at being welcomed so warmly. One of the Hai governors thanks you for transporting him, and pays you <payment>.`
	"CN-14462" `You recall a hooded figure offering a business opportunity in this shipyard. Do you want to follow their directions, and head to the specified coordinates?`
	"CN-14463" `	(Maybe another time.)`
	"CN-14464" `	(Never.)`
	"CN-14465" `As you're browsing the shipyard, you are discreetly approached by a hooded figure. When you stop to see what they want to say, they grab and pull on your arm to follow them. "Keep walking," the stranger hisses. After pointing at and commenting on random ships, as if to mimic the actions of a regular passerby, they address you again.`
	"CN-14466" `	"My associates and I have a lucrative business proposition for you. It will require your undivided attention, so you would do well to finish any ongoing business first. If you are interested, come find us at these coordinates."`
	"CN-14467" `	Just before leaving they add, "We note you operate multiple ships. However, this is a solitary affair; make sure you can park most of your ships."`
	"CN-14468" `	Without waiting for a response, they fold a piece of paper into your hand before quickly fading into the crowd. It lists only a location, and if you cross-reference it with the local maps, it appears to point towards a beach on the other side of the planet.`
	"CN-14469" `	However, the paper also mentions you need to have at least ten million credits in cash! You'll have to save up or take a loan and then come back another day before heading to the specified location.`
	"CN-14470" `	Will you go there?`
	"CN-14471" `	While you're pondering whether or not there will be enough space to land your ship at the beach, you notice a train ticket attached to the back of the paper. A few more written notes give specific directions on how to get there, with a clear demand not to take your starship at the bottom.`
	"CN-14472" `	To your surprise, the local train station is located underground. You can't begin to make sense of the enormity of it - it almost feels like you can reach the entire planet from here. You ask a Hai for directions, feeling embarrassed when you learn that all you had to do was scan your ticket at a nearby terminal and all relevant information would be displayed for you.`
	"CN-14473" `	After departing the train station, you hike for a few hours until you reach your destination. Upon arriving, you look around for the stranger. Besides a cave, some sparse vegetation, and of course the beach itself, you cannot see anything significant in the vicinity. You double-check that these are the right coordinates and look around some more.`
	"CN-14474" `	You wait for some time until you spot two hooded figures further down the beach, and you start to doubt whether or not this was a good idea as they make their way toward you. Even when they're close enough to speak, their faces somehow remain impossible to glimpse beneath the hoods. "Hello, <last>," one says to you. "We are sorry for the secrecy, but the truth is, we cannot afford to take risks. It is best for all if you do not know who we are, and we needed a secluded area to speak to you."`
	"CN-14475" `	"How do you know me?"`
	"CN-14476" `	They seem surprised at your sudden change of mind, but make no effort to stop you.`
	"CN-14477" `	Without any incidents, you return to the train station and buy a ticket back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-14478" `	The second one grins. "Any outsider landing on our homeworld must be well-known. We know you have helped our kind."`
	"CN-14479" `	"Though do not think we are unaware of your skirmishes with the Unfettered," the first adds with a serious tone.`
	"CN-14480" `	Suddenly, you hear a loud roar coming from the sea behind you, and the ground begins to shake.`
	"CN-14481" `	The waves become agitated and wind rushes past you as a shape surrounded by fumes emerges out of the water, as if an ancient sea monster was rising from the depths.`
	"CN-14482" `	But it is no monster. It is a ship, and its weapons are aimed straight at you!`
	"CN-14483" `	(Run!)`
	"CN-14484" `	(Try to contact my fleet for help.)`
	"CN-14485" `	(Shoot it!)`
	"CN-14486" `	As you try to react, the Hai closest to you firmly grabs your arm and shouts through the noise. "If this ship wanted to kill you, <last>, you would already be dead."`
	"CN-14487" `	You can barely hear anything over the sound of the engines as the ship proceeds to land on the beach. Suddenly, all is calm. They turn to you, one more at ease than the other. "This ship means you no harm."`
	"CN-14488" `	"Why didn't you say anything before that happened?"`
	"CN-14489" `	The second one replies, "We could have, but where's the fun in that? We wanted to see how you would react.`
	"CN-14490" `	"This ship is our guarantee that nothing goes wrong, should you attempt something against us. After all, we are still not sure if we can trust you."`
	"CN-14491" `	The two Hai then take you to a nearby cave. Crystals embedded in the walls cast a faint blue glow as you follow them, until you approach a large chamber where sunlight breaks through cracks, revealing another ship. The first Hai then speaks again. "That ship outside is not for sale. This one, however, is a mighty relic of the past, intended for war from the times our empire used to control the stars - an Anomalocaris!"`
	"CN-14492" `	The second one now takes a step toward you to speak, almost interrupting the first. "We have a proposition for you. Should you agree to bring much needed supplies to our brethren, the Unfettered Hai, we will sell you this ship for the modest price of ten million credits - including two weapons belonging to the savage Korath!" The first one seems surprised by this and tries to intervene, but the second resumes before they can speak up.`
	"CN-14493" `	"These legendary weapons can interfere with nearly any engine system! Worry not, you'll be able to recuperate the cost of this ship with ease by assisting us. A load of medical supplies is needed on <destination>, and we lack the time and personnel to bring them ourselves on such short notice.`
	"CN-14494" `	"Of course, the ship is aged, and you should not expect the best price in a shipyard. Nevertheless, it is a fine vessel, capable of fighting, freighting, and mining. So, what do you say, <last>? This is the opportunity of a lifetime; they simply don't make ships like this anymore."`
	"CN-14495" `	"If you lack crew, who was piloting the other ship?"`
	"CN-14496" `	"Why was the other ship hidden underwater?"`
	"CN-14497" `	"No, thanks. I'm not looking to add another ship to my fleet."`
	"CN-14498" `	The two Hai look disappointed. "A shame. We will probably not meet again," one says. "It is best you forget we have met here," says the other. They signal the ship from earlier to submerge into the ocean again and walk off along the beach.`
	"CN-14499" `	"The less you know, the better for all of us, Captain."`
	"CN-14500" `	"We found it there," the first one answers.`
	"CN-14501" `	"It is hard to find a drop of rain in a storm, but the drop of rain may see all as it falls," the other one adds.`
	"CN-14502" `	They give you access to the ship and proceed to explain the details. "It is of no real significance, but surely you understand we cannot go through standard means for this sale. We will instead present it as a fine. You'll be charged for carrying technology you had no idea was forbidden, as these Korath weapons are suspicious indeed. However, it will not go on your permanent record."`
	"CN-14503" `	You quickly realize that they are not asking you for your opinion at all. In fact, you receive notice of the fine before they have even finished speaking. "We will need to make some modifications to the ship before you can use it.`
	"CN-14504" `	(Go back to the shipyard.)`
	"CN-14505" `	"Why would they mind a different ship?"`
	"CN-14506" `	"As this ship is ancient, the Unfettered will try to preserve it. The same might not be true for other ships."`
	"CN-14507" `	They walk away until you cannot hear them speak anymore, leaving you with the access codes to the ship so you can bring it to the shipyard. With the aid of the autopilot, you manage to pilot the ship without any complications.`
	"CN-14508" `	You get your weapon out and proceed to shoot at the ship.`
	"CN-14509" `	Your shot reaches the ship, but the small weapon has no chance of doing anything to the heavy armor, even if it is somewhat worn. The ship then shoots back at you, barely missing and causing a geyser of sand to erupt at you, forcing you to drop your weapon. One of the two Hai then approaches you, seemingly disappointed.`
	"CN-14510" `	"You're lucky to still be alive, but even so you are of no use to us if you think it wise to use your firearm on a spaceship. Farewell." They turn and leave without another word, and the ship flies off.`
	"CN-14511" `	You manage to land a shot, although it seems to do nothing to the large spacecraft before you. Then you hear a small explosion. You aren't sure whether the damaged ship's systems failed on their own, or if by some stroke of luck, your shot did something to it.`
	"CN-14512" `	Unfortunately, you do not get a chance to ponder your actions, as the ship abruptly explodes, taking you and everyone else on the beach down with it.`
	"CN-14513" `	You miss your shot. Neither the ship nor the two Hai react. You feel like you heard a chuckle, but you're not sure where it came from.`
	"CN-14514" `You leave the shipyard and go to the spaceport after your encounter. A worker immediately greets you while others begin to fill your ship with crates, and a quick check of the shipment data shows that the cargo has already been allocated in your name. All that's left is to deliver it to <destination> by <date>.`
	"CN-14515" `	As you head to back to your ship and prepare to take off from the planet, you notice a message on the command panel:`
	"CN-14516" `	"You would be wise to bring the Anomalocaris we trusted you with for your delivery."`
	"CN-14517" `As you enter the system, you prepare for a fight to get the cargo through. However, the usually aggressive Unfettered have suddenly stopped firing at you.`
	"CN-14518" `After delivering the supplies, you realize your ship is the center of attention. One Unfettered that looks like an engineer comes to speak to you, initially warmer than usual compared to your previous experiences with other Unfettered.`
	"CN-14519" `	"Welcome. Although I do not know how you have obtained this ship, I imagine some of us will see it as a sign. You see, it is a relic of our past, a past we are quite proud of. As such, most Unfettered warriors will say that you need to prove your right to use it."`
	"CN-14520" `	After a sigh, her tone then changes. "But I don't believe in any of that. What does matter to me is that ship is both durable and filled with valuable ancient technology."`
	"CN-14521" `	Her eyes light up as she focuses more on your ship. "I even see weapons that we fought valiantly to obtain from the savage Korath!"`
	"CN-14522" `	All of a sudden, she raises her voice for everyone to hear. "I, Mera, challenge you! The winner will earn the right to own this honorable relic and its mighty weapons!"`
	"CN-14523" `	"What do I get if I win?"`
	"CN-14524" `	"Can't I just sell it to you?"`
	"CN-14525" `	"I bought this ship. It's mine and I shall do what I please with it."`
	"CN-14526" `	"No, because in the eyes of my brethren that would mean I, too, did not deserve this ship. They would then challenge me for it."`
	"CN-14527" `	Mera turns around, talking to other Unfettered for a bit before addressing you again. "You will win the right to access our worlds. But, in order to keep our respect, you must keep this Anomalocaris in good condition until you prove yourself another way. It is a priceless artifact. Should you refuse to prove your worth, you will no longer be allowed to land here."`
	"CN-14528" `	She then glares at you. "Beware, for although there are no official rules, you must use only the Anomalocaris. So, will you take to the skies, or are you too afraid?"`
	"CN-14529" `	"I accept."`
	"CN-14530" `	"I have nothing to prove to you. This is my ship now."`
	"CN-14531" `	Mera grins. "Good! I won't be fighting you personally, as it is too risky to do so. I am but an engineer, after all. I would also not want to deny my brother and his crew the opportunity to prove themselves against a powerful human warrior!"`
	"CN-14532" `	You're not sure if Mera is being serious or not, but her friends seem to be in for it. One that appears to be their leader approaches you. "So you think you deserve to fly this mighty ship of the Hai empire?"`
	"CN-14533" `	"Yeah, what makes you think that, human?" another one adds.`
	"CN-14534" `	"Are you trying to scare me out of the fight?"`
	"CN-14535" `	"I guess we'll find out," says a third.`
	"CN-14536" `	The leader of the group gets closer and addresses you in a more serious tone. "You should be aware that this is not so much a friendly competition as it is a fight for you to truly earn the right to fly this ship. You should know that this fight has a few... implicit rules, even if there are no official ones. We would assume everyone knows them, but since you are an outsider I will explain them to you," he says as he leads you away from the group.`
	"CN-14537" `	"Naturally, because this is a duel, nobody other than us may interfere, but you should also know that being disabled counts as a loss. Don't even think about tricking us by switching to something other than this Anomalocaris, or we will not bother showing up! You must prove you deserve it, after all. To the victor go the spoils, so looting is allowed, but do not attempt to steal our ships. Do so, and all the Unfettered will be against you!"`
	"CN-14538" `	He then looks at you intensely, straight in the eyes. "We sometimes bend the rules for our friends, but that is not the case with you."`
	"CN-14539" `	Mera starts to look a bit impatient. "Are you going to talk all day, or are you going to fight? Head to Ehma Ti already!" The Unfettered immediately head to their ships, but Mera pulls you in close once they are far enough away. "I want this done by the end of the day, so do not try my patience. You are lucky I offered this deal in the first place, as they were planning to take the relic by force. Now, quick, get to your ship! Make any last minute modifications you may need, and then come fight us."`
	"CN-14540" `	You see the Unfettered have already begun their launching procedures, so you should prepare for takeoff in your Anomalocaris, and no other ships, as soon as you can.`
	"CN-14541" `	Seeing as they are unlikely to cooperate, you quickly head to your ship and launch, with the Unfettered rushing after you.`
	"CN-14542" `As you leave the planet's atmosphere, you receive a short message. "We are waiting for you in Ehma Ti today. Do not disappoint us."`
	"CN-14543" `The Unfettered don't seem too pleased to see you leaving with their prize. The challenger is already waiting for you in orbit, and hails you. "Where do you think you're going, monkey?"`
	"CN-14544" `As you take off to join your fleet in orbit, you receive a hail from the Unfettered. "You must leave your fleet on hold here. If they help you, the duel will be forfeit!"`
	"CN-14545" `You are hailed by the Unfettered as soon as you reach orbit. "You think us blind, monkey? That is not the relic! You're not even worth a launch sequence."`
	"CN-14546" `As you enter the system you can see your challenger is indeed waiting for you, and they promptly send you a hail. "Show us what you've got, monkey! Show us that you control your weapons well, as any warrior should! Prove to us that you have the strength to disable our ships, yet still have the restraint not to destroy them!"`
	"CN-14547" `As you arrive with your fleet in this system, you receive a hail from the Unfettered. "If you can't even count how many ships you have, you're not worthy of our time, monkey! Dishonor will get you nowhere with us True Hai!"`
	"CN-14548" `After your ship is disabled, one of the Unfettered ships hails you. "You have lost the challenge, but we didn't expect much from a human like you. We will repair your ship for a fair bribe, but you better land at one of our worlds and return it to us with a most generous compensation. If you try to keep it from us, we'll do things the hard way.`
	"CN-14549" `	"Be warned, however, that your truce with us ends as soon as you land. Today, you've failed us. Maybe someday you will prove yourself otherwise."`
	"CN-14550" `When you land in one piece, Mera approaches, looking quite surprised. "You really won! I saw everything, and the data I got on the effects of these exotic weapons will be quite useful for my research. Was it hard for you?"`
	"CN-14551" `	"It was fun."`
	"CN-14552" `	"This was easy!"`
	"CN-14553" `	"It was a challenge."`
	"CN-14554" `	"Don't get overconfident, Captain," she muses. "I am sure you know what happens to such pilots.`
	"CN-14555" `	"Oh, so their plan almost worked after all? Maybe I should have participated in the fight too.`
	"CN-14556" `	"Well, congratulations, I did not think you had it in you. I will give you authorization to land, on the condition that you keep this relic from our past in one piece. Remember, right now, your reputation with us is solely due to that ship. If you somehow lose it because of incompetence on your own end, it would look pretty bad to the True Hai."`
	"CN-14557" `	Mera then walks off as she begins reviewing data from your fight on a small device. For now, it seems that the Unfettered Hai have some level of respect for you, so long as you have the Anomalocaris.`
	"CN-14558" `As you land, countless Hai hastily head to your ship, each armed with several weapons. One of them points at you and makes a declaration in front of the crowd that is quickly forming, shouting loud enough for all to hear. "You do not deserve to fly this relic of old!"`
	"CN-14559" `	One standing behind them then chimes in. "You wasted your opportunity for a glorious battle to earn that right! We know of what you've failed!"`
	"CN-14560" `	A more important-looking Unfettered then steps up close to you, speaking in a menacing tone. "You must surrender the ship to us immediately, along with the weapons of the savages, if you did not already rob us of those." For a moment, they look down in thought, then speak to you once more. "We will give you another ship so you can leave, but you must give us the Anomalocaris!"`
	"CN-14561" `	(Hand over the Anomalocaris.)`
	"CN-14562" `	(Decline their request and leave.)`
	"CN-14563" `	You and your crew exit what was briefly your ship, and the local Unfettered militia are informed that it is now theirs. The Unfettered that were assembling around your ship happily disperse, except for one - probably the leader, judging by the amount of weaponry on their person. They come to talk to you, weapons in hand but lowered. "We are happy you could see reason and decided to hand over the ship. In exchange, we will provide you with a suitable replacement.`
	"CN-14564" `	"That relic was not meant for you, but there are other ways for you to prove yourself to us." The leader of these Unfettered continues with blatantly forced casualness. "Say, for example, bringing us a Jump Drive... or two... that for sure will earn you favor, and prove you can fight."`
	"CN-14565" `	The leader of the Unfettered group then has a few of them escort you to the edge of the spaceport. On your way there, some of them seemed to be holding back some frustration, and you could have sworn one wanted to attack you at any moment. Eventually you are lead to a landed Lightning Bug, and after some messy paperwork, the Unfettered leave it with you.`
	"CN-14566" `A voice begins to speak from somewhere. "Your path brings you to a dead end, traveler. Nothing for you lies further."`
	"CN-14567" `	Alarmed, you look around but nobody is there. You check your scanners but there is nothing present in this system except a few indigenous lifeforms. However, your navigation system displays hyperspace routes that lead beyond it.`
	"CN-14568" `	"This doesn't appear to be a dead end."`
	"CN-14569" `	"Why should I listen to you?"`
	"CN-14570" `	"Ignoring these words is only but folly. Turn around, traveler." The voice echoes in the air, again with no indication of where it came from.`
	"CN-14571" `	"You can't fool me. This is no dead end."`
	"CN-14572" `	"Here lie the unborn flowers yet to come into full bloom. There is nothing here for you to find. Heed this advice and turn back." The voice sounds more energetic this time, and you feel as if it is coming out of your head.`
	"CN-14573" `	"Unborn flowers. That sounds interesting."`
	"CN-14574" `	"I will see for myself."`
	"CN-14575" `	"Thank you for the warning."`
	"CN-14576" `	A deep sigh seems to drift through the continuum. "Human, these unborn flowers would only be endangered by your presence." An impression of euphoria comes over you as you once again hear the words 'unborn flowers.'`
	"CN-14577" `"Please respect the beauty of life and do not step into this region that will soon bring forth another. Your kind is much more advanced than anything that you could hope to find here. No treasures here await you."`
	"CN-14578" `	"Why do you care about these 'flowers'?"`
	"CN-14579" `	"What I search for is not technology."`
	"CN-14580" `	The voice now takes on a calm tone. "Your persistence on this topic is admirable, but allow me to explain my conviction with an example."`
	"CN-14581" `	"Why do humans care about art?" The voice now seems far away yet more present than ever. "Because it amazes you, the same way it amazes us to see another kind grow and overcome their burdens. The lives of others are like a painting that never stops being painted, but is a tragic thing to watch the painting stop. That is why we try to protect these creations of life - so we can see what heights they reach."`
	"CN-14582" `	There is a pause. "I see that you can not be convinced by me. Though I could intervene in your journey, I do not favor unsavory confrontation." The voice is now resolute in tone. "I will let you pass, but I will be watching you, as I am the guardian of this space."`
	"CN-14583" `	The voice fades out leaving nothing behind but the feeling of being watched.`
	"CN-14584" `	"You are understanding, human, so I thank you in the name of the Incipias." The voice fades away, leaving only the feeling of being watched."`
	"CN-14585" `The presence from the previous system somehow lingers as you continue to feel as though you're being watched.`
	"CN-14586" `As you enter the system, the same voice from before echoes through your mind, though this time there seems to be a heavy weight behind it. "I do not take kindly to your deception, human. Know that you will be watched." The voice fades away, but the strong presence of something remains.`
	"CN-14587" `As you enter the system, you notice ships of a type you have never seen before. Hailing them only gives you static. After some more unsuccessful attempts, you give up. Maybe you can find some more information in nearby systems.`
	"CN-14588" `As you enter the system, you notice ships of a type you have never seen before. Hailing them only gives you static. After some more unsuccessful attempts, you give up. This must be the species the Quarg talked about.`
	"CN-14589" `Your spaceship lands with a soft jolt as a small group of Quarg quickly gathers around it, making some simple but clear gestures telling you to wait. After they've realized that you understood, one of them walks away in a hurried manner. You wait for quite some time until a different Quarg arrives, presumably one that can speak your language. It begins to speak in an accent you can't place.`
	"CN-14590" `	After landing your ship on the moon, you have to wait for a decent amount of time for a group of three Quarg to appear. The one in the middle gestures you to approach them, and they begin to speak in an accent you can't place.`
	"CN-14591" `	"Welcome, human. Your lengthy wanderings have brought forth you here, yet your kind has never set foot in this region of the stars. May we inquire as to your mission?"`
	"CN-14592" `	"I am just exploring the galaxy."`
	"CN-14593" `	"I am looking for new species."`
	"CN-14594" `	"It is an obvious pursuit for the young," it nods. "If I may advise you, do not perambulate across this quarter of space in a careless manner. The galaxy carries many perilous situations that your kind has yet to uncover or even to comprehend." It straightens up to its full height, towering over you.`
	"CN-14595" `	"What a peculiar task that is." It looks confused and tilts its head. "What do you hope to achieve by this? That an unfathomable amount of dangers come with encountering and treating with other species, did you not foresee? The boundaries of space are not idle accidents. I advise you to be scrupulous and ponder every last step."`
	"CN-14596" `	After a short pause, you notice an almost-hidden frustration lurking beneath the Quarg's face before it continues speaking. "You are authorized to continue your nomadic voyagings here, but there are demands we Quarg make of you. Within a trifling interval of this moon the neighboring kind has initiated their journey to the stars. Do not interrupt them for yours, or sake of their own."`
	"CN-14597" `	With these words the Quarg turn around and leave. It seems like you are free to use the local facilities now.`
	"CN-14598" `As you approach the derelict ship, it sends you a hail request. Once you accept the hail, color gradients suddenly start moving over your screen in a dizzying fashion, but curiously there is no audio. It's clear that unless you have some sort of translation device, you will not be able to understand whatever transmission you just witnessed. You continue your attempt to assist the ship, preparing to bring some repair supplies on board.`
	"CN-14599" `	You manage to dock to the disabled ship quite easily. The hatch opens and as a hallway opens up before you, it is immediately obvious that this ship was not designed for humans. The walls are strangely curved, and the floor has nearly no grip at all. As you carry the repair equipment into the ship, your view is caught by five giant aliens - half octopod, half jellyfish in appearance. They pulsate in bright colors similar to the gradients that appeared on your screen earlier. One of them is floating behind what's clearly a giant mounted weapon, and the two barrels are pointed right at you. The alien gunner flashes in an orange light, and you can feel the tension in the room rising.`
	"CN-14600" `	(Try to convey that I intend no harm.)`
	"CN-14601" `	(Drop the repair equipment and run back into my ship.)`
	"CN-14602" `	(Try to shoot at the one behind the turret and run.)`
	"CN-14603" `	You hit the creature manning the turret, causing it to explode with a strident sound. Before you can enjoy your short-lived victory, you notice a motion further down the hallway. Turning your head you see a gunner flashing in a deep red, before shooting you down and avenging their fallen comrade.`
	"CN-14604" `	Feeling that the situation could escalate any moment, you slowly place the crate with the repair equipment on the ground and walk back a few steps. You are careful not to make any hasty movements. Both you and the aliens are still for a moment until one of them slowly floats forward. Tones of yellow are now mixing into the creature's orange color, and two of their tentacles wrap around the crate while the other four back off in response. Once the alien manages to open the crate and look inside, its colors shift to a weak green. The rest of the crew also seem to relax as they take on the same color.`
	"CN-14605" `	With the aliens retrieving the repair equipment, there is nothing else you can do, given the communication barrier. Just as you leave, you can see how the aliens start pulsating in all colors of the spectrum; gradients are moving over their skin so fast that they almost look white.`
	"CN-14606" `	You drop the repair equipment and run back into your ship, smashing the button that closes the lock. You get a last look of one of the aliens: blue and yellow tones are mixing on their skin, but they are not taking any action.`
	"CN-14607" `	As you fly away you see the engines of the ship slowly booting back up. Apparently they figured out how to use the repair equipment. Instead of leaving the system, however, the ship begins to fly towards a nearby gas giant.`
	"CN-14608" `	Back on your ship, your eyes fall on the scanner log that is still open on your monitor. Notably, this ship had no hyperdrive or anything similar installed, which is strange considering there is no inhabited planet in this system. Maybe you should talk to the Quarg and see if they have any insight on this.`
	"CN-14609" `Upon entering the system, you notice a lone alien spaceship that is disabled and badly damaged. Aside from it, there do not appear to be any other ships in the system, or sign of any help for that matter. Maybe there's some way you could assist the ship and its crew.`
	"CN-14610" `Would you like to ask the Quarg for insight on your strange encounter with the stranded alien ship?`
	"CN-14611" `	Right after you arrive on the planet, you search for a Quarg who speaks your language so that you can tell them about the stranded ship you found. One of the Quarg seems to understand your intention and gestures for you to wait. It returns a few moments later accompanied by the same Quarg you talked to before.`
	"CN-14612" `	"Human, you seem to be in quite a haste. What could be such a pressing matter?" it asks.`
	"CN-14613" `	"I need advice regarding the species in this region."`
	"CN-14614" `	It looks at you curiously. "So you have held council with the young Incipias? This one is nonplussed that you ably formed correspondence. It took a prolonged period of time even for us to decipher their way of dissemination."`
	"CN-14615" `	You quickly explain what happened. From what you can tell, the Quarg seems relieved that you were not able to talk to them.`
	"CN-14616" `	"You ran into a most peculiar situation. Surpassing the borders of their system is not yet a capability possessed by the Incipias." It tilts its head for a moment, considering what you just said. "It is our desire to help them, but it is yet premature for us to reveal ourselves to their species, and certainly premature for them to be interacting with independent interlopers such as yourself. I fear that we are impotent in this unfortunate turn of events."`
	"CN-14617" `	"I could help them."`
	"CN-14618" `	"How can you make such a cold-hearted decision?"`
	"CN-14619" `	"I understand. I'll leave them alone."`
	"CN-14620" `	"You lack the tools for such a mission. To this one's knowledge, no vessels capable of landing on gas giants have ever been developed by your kind. And you are certainly not able to make your intentions known to them in any meaningful sense." The Quarg stares at you for a moment, pondering a little.`
	"CN-14621" `	"But for the sake of the Incipias, this one will assist you on this last point. If you cannot be dissuaded from your course of action, then it is best you are supplied a means of communication, so that your interactions may be on amicable terms. This one can produce you with a single one of our translators, which will allow you to relate your intentions to the species. Request that they sell you one of their ships, so that you are made capable to land on their tumultuous planets."`
	"CN-14622" `	It pauses before taking on a more serious tone. "However, you are forbidden from granting the young species any advanced technology of yours. If you concur with us on that point, we shall furnish you with a translator."`
	"CN-14623" `	"If that's how I can help them, sure."`
	"CN-14624" `	"Why do you not want me to give them my tech?"`
	"CN-14625" `	"Halting the natural increase of a species is unpredictable at the best of times. Your species lacks the wisdom to understand this, as you are young, and have not seen what we have seen." The Quarg pauses for a moment, lost in thought. "The foreseeable risks of even letting you contact them are monumental, and not something you should consider trivial."`
	"CN-14626" `	"I will accept your conditions to help them."`
	"CN-14627" `	"The risks do sound concerning. I will leave them alone after all."`
	"CN-14628" `	"Happy this one is that you agree to that condition. Bear in mind, Captain, that the slightest misstep may have grave consequences." The Quarg stares you down. "We will be watching your actions, to verify that they are peaceful and without ill or unwise intent. Please for a moment remain here," it says, and walks away.`
	"CN-14629" `	The Quarg only takes a moment to come back, now carrying a sleek silver box with a display on one side. "This is our translator, our link to the Incipias. It is able to translate their unusual language into your speech as well. Be aware of the honor of this one gifting this to you," it says.`
	"CN-14630" `	As you stow it away, the Quarg speaks once more. "To satisfactorily utilize this device, you must direct it towards the source of the communication, so that it is made able to discern the relevant emissions. Given the complexity of their language, the translator might not be able to adequately translate some aspects of their obscure speech."`
	"CN-14631" `	It then looks you directly in the eyes. "Remember what has been told, human. The stars have no place for those who would act foolishly and thoughtlessly towards their fellow beings." The Quarg then walks away, leaving you alone.`
	"CN-14632" `	"It is perhaps a laborious task for an adolescent species such as yourself to comprehend our ways, but we must place the continuation of species above the existence of individuals. If we reveal ourselves to them at this inopportune moment, the shock of such an advanced species appearing in their space will fan the flames of chaos."`
	"CN-14633" `	"Then let me help them."`
	"CN-14634" `	"You can deal with the consequences later. Help them now!"`
	"CN-14635" `	The Quarg takes on a sour look. "Insisting you are. Understand that our own intervention is out of the question." It sighs. "However, this one can foresee the likelihood of you making a rash and impetuous decision to contact these Incipias further."`
	"CN-14636" `	"Sure. Let me do the work."`
	"CN-14637" `	"If you insist on not helping..."`
	"CN-14638" `	The Quarg rapidly clicks its teeth before continuing.`
	"CN-14639" `	"We are gracious for your understanding, but remember thus: the Incipias are under our watch and care. None shall come to harm them without incurring our wrath." With these words the Quarg turns away.`
	"CN-14640" `After you enter the system, you prepare to broadcast your first message with the Quarg's translator.`
	"CN-14641" `	"Hello. I am Captain <first> <last>, here to make contact."`
	"CN-14642" `	"Greetings, strangers. I seek to help you."`
	"CN-14643" `	You notice that the translator starts to flash a sequence of lights, and you point it towards your ship's communication device. For a minute, nothing happens at all.`
	"CN-14644" `	After some time, a wave of movement passes through all ships in the system, and a communication channel opens from the space station. Colors rush over your display: a mix of yellow and green. You point your translator towards the flashing lights and hope it is able to pick up whatever these aliens are saying to you.`
	"CN-14645" `	"Welcome world-traveler. We greet you in our home-space." The voice is smooth and synthetic, lacking in any discernible emotion. The colors stop before rushing over your screen again. "What is your intention-goal here?"`
	"CN-14646" `	"I am here to make peaceful contact with you."`
	"CN-14647" `	"I want to help one of your stranded ships."`
	"CN-14648" `	Again a long pause. "Your intention-goals are welcome. Please dock to the capital-station." Along the message comes a small map of the station with the docking ports highlighted.`
	"CN-14649" `Thanks to the map, you are easily able to dock with the station. Your airlock opens and you enter an environment like nothing you've ever seen before. There are no hallways like you would see in a human space station - instead, tubes full of fog, some of which even ascend vertically, appear to be the only way of getting around. A crowd of beings gathered in front of your airlock, each flashing a multitude of colors. A group of five floats in front of the crowd, and the middle one starts pulsating in calm tones.`
	"CN-14650" `	"Welcome, outer-being, to our capital. We are the Incipias." It stops as if awaiting an answer.`
	"CN-14651" `	"Greetings, Incipias. I am a human."`
	"CN-14652" `	"I thank you for your hospitality."`
	"CN-14653" `	Your translator begins rapidly flashing. The Incipias seem to respond to this - movement and colors begin to diffuse through the crowd like waves.`
	"CN-14654" `	The "speaker" continues. "You are the first outer-being that ever communicated with us. Are you the only outer-being out there?"`
	"CN-14655" `	"No, there are others too."`
	"CN-14656" `	"The galaxy is full of other beings."`
	"CN-14657" `	Another wave goes through the crowd. "So there are more. But, far-stranger, how can we help you?"`
	"CN-14658" `	(Tell them about the stranded ship and how I want to help them.)`
	"CN-14659" `	"I want one of your ships."`
	"CN-14660" `	"We shall allow you to buy one, if that is all that it takes to make you a not-danger. Please excuse us. We need to talk about what this new situation-opportunity means for our species. I hope we can out-question you more another time."`
	"CN-14661" `	Another wave goes through the crowd, but this time you notice an overflow in green tones.`
	"CN-14662" `	"So they are still alive. We shall give you access to our ships, so that you may enter the air-planet they have taken refuge in. Do note though that they cannot jump between system-places, not like your own ship. We hope to question you more on another future-time."`
	"CN-14663" `	The five float away but the crowd continues staring at you, probably out of interest.`
	"CN-14664" `Your ship dives into the clouds of the gas giant, entering an environment on a scale you have never experienced before. Giant clouds tower like castles, sometimes opening to similarly large caverns of air. Whirlwinds brush through the atmosphere like pillars holding the sky. Though the winds are brutal, your ship glides through them as if they had no effect on it at all.`
	"CN-14665" `	Activating your scanners, you look for the stranded ship from before. Soon, a small blip appears on your radar, and you maneuver your ship to its location. The stranded ship appears, looking even worse off than the first time. The storms seem to have damaged some of the hull, and its shields are completely down; the shield generator could have gone offline when they ran out of fuel.`
	"CN-14666" `	Any attempt to hail the Incipias ship results in no answer. Carefully, you maneuver your own ship closer until you are able to dock with it.`
	"CN-14667" `	When the airlock opens, you see five Incipias floating in front of you. They seem on guard at first, and it takes them a moment to recognize you from the previous encounter as you prepare your translation device to speak with them.`
	"CN-14668" `	When the airlock opens, you see five Incipias floating in front of you. Noticing your presence, they quickly back off; they were clearly not expecting a human piloting one of their own ships. It takes them a moment to recognize you from the previous encounter as you prepare your translation device to speak with them.`
	"CN-14669" `	"Hello, I have come to save you."`
	"CN-14670" `	"I have been sent by your people to get you home."`
	"CN-14671" `	The Incipias seem to switch from a tense state to a surprised one, and one of them starts pulsating. "You light our language? How surprising. We would not have survived another day-moment here. You are our life-protector. We would love to talk more, but a weather-calamity is coming. We should leave now." The lack of emotion in the translation is concerning, given the content of the message.`
	"CN-14672" `	You tell them to board your ship, and shortly after, you take off. Luckily, you leave just in time to avoid a powerful windstorm approaching the area.`
	"CN-14673" `Once you land on the station, your passengers thank you again and leave, probably to get some well-earned rest. As you step out of the <ship>, another Incipias approaches you. Its scales seem worn down, and you notice intricate claw-like attachments around the end of its tentacles. "Follow me, outer-helper, before a crowd gathers. We would like to talk."`
	"CN-14674" `	They guide you through the hallways so that you avoid larger groups, though they choose only horizontal corridors. You arrive in a large room with a view over the entire station, with three Incipias already present. One begins to glow.`
	"CN-14675" `	"Welcome. We are the leader-governers of the Hicemus, the reigning government of the Incipias. If you agree we would like to ask you a few question-queries. In return we would be open for question-queries as well."`
	"CN-14676" `	"Sure, ask me something."`
	"CN-14677" `	"Sorry, but I have other stuff to do."`
	"CN-14678" `	A green glow appears on all of them. "Thank you for taking the time-patience to speak with us. Can you tell us more about the deep space-void surrounding us?"`
	"CN-14679" `	(Give them an exhaustive story of what I have seen so far.)`
	"CN-14680" `	(Give a rough overview of what I have seen.)`
	"CN-14681" `	After "seeing" your explanation, a rapid-fire sequence of colors is exchanged between the Incipias. Your translator cannot follow, so you are left watching them flash in what end up being yellow tones mixed with green and red.`
	"CN-14682" `	"Thank you for this insight. All we gathered until now was by observing-studying stars. To think that there is so much out there... it truly raise-strengthens a determination to explore.`
	"CN-14683" `	After "watching" your explanation, a rapid-fire sequence of colors is exchanged between the Incipias. Your translator cannot follow, so you are left watching them flash in what ends up being yellow tones mixed with green.`
	"CN-14684" `	"Thank you for this profound-depth insight. All we gathered until now was by observing-studying stars close to us. To think that there is so much out there... it truly invokes a determination-will to explore.`
	"CN-14685" `	"But now to you. Is there anything you would like to know?"`
	"CN-14686" `	"Why can I not land on your home planet?"`
	"CN-14687" `	"Why do you call this station your capital?"`
	"CN-14688" `	"How is life on a gas giant?"`
	"CN-14689" `	"I do not have any more questions."`
	"CN-14690" `	A flash of red appears for only a second. "Our origin-world is not directly ruled by us. They may approach you separately at a future-point, but be careful of their lights. They have aged-time values long left-alone by us, who are progressing fast.`
	"CN-14691" `	The one pulsating now takes on a bright green color, "This station is our greatest action-pride, our star-bridge. In honor of our urge to expand we made this station our capital to demonstrate our determination."`
	"CN-14692" `	"What an odd-reasonable question." It's glow turns into a swirl of purple and green. "We could ask the same in return - what is it like to live on hard rock? But we understand its reasoning-origin. So let me tell you of the cloud-halls of our home-sky. Lightning will draw the most beautiful color-sings between the pillar-clouds. Between them are our cities, the most color-lifeful places you will ever see. This is a bit of a poetic-gradient description, but I do not know what else to say."`
	"CN-14693" `	"Thank you again for your time. You have given us much to process. We hope you too have benefited from this meeting-talk."`
	"CN-14694" `	You say goodbye, and as you leave the room, you can see a rush of colors reflecting onto the walls.`
	"CN-14695" `	"We are understanding-sad. Safe travels, captain." You notice a slight blue tone in the representative's communication as one of the Incipias guides you back to your ship.`
	"CN-14696" `You draw the <flagship> alongside this strange entity, which, despite its lack of motion, seems to exude an ominous presence. Something feels fundamentally wrong with this ship as you approach a hole in a vulnerable part of its hull, which seems to be some kind of shell encasing a large, slug-like creature. Exposed to weapons fire, the creature seems to be dead, but you feel almost as if something is watching you.`
	"CN-14697" `	You have no trouble docking with what seems to be its "exoskeleton," trying to decide what to do next. While the Aberrant is too different from a normal ship for you to command it, it's safe to say that you can now loot some of its outfits. The rest appear to be embedded in some kind of hard, glassy tissue; perhaps destroying the ship could release them.`
	"CN-14698" `You draw the <flagship> alongside this strange, yet almost-familiar entity, which, despite its lack of motion, seems to exude an ominous presence. Something feels fundamentally wrong with this ship, which superficially resembles a Ka'het, yet is clearly not one - perhaps a distant relation, or a Ka'het that has been irrevocably changed by something else. You approach a hole in a vulnerable part of its hull, where a 'het slug appears dead, but you feel almost as if it still watches you.`
	"CN-14699" `	You have no trouble docking with its "exoskeleton," trying to decide what to do next. While the Aberrant is too different from a normal ship for you to command it, it's safe to say that you can now loot some of its outfits. The rest appear to be embedded in some kind of hard, glassy tissue; perhaps destroying the ship could release them.`
	"CN-14700" `Your ship slowly approaches the <origin>, now floating lifeless near you. As you move closer, you spot a massive hole in the hull of the ship, revealing what appears to be a large, slug-like being. While most of the ship's machinery doesn't seem to have received heavy damage, weapons fire must have hit the slug's vital organs, killing it, after which point the ship seems to have stopped working.`
	"CN-14701" `	You have no troubles docking with what seems to be its "exoskeleton," trying to decide what to do next. While the Ka'het is too different from a normal ship for you to command it, it's safe to say that you can now loot its outfits.`
	"CN-14702" `Your ship slowly approaches the <origin>, now floating lifelessly near you. As you move closer, you spot a massive hole in the hull of the ship, revealing what appears to be a large, slug-like being, very similar to what you found inside the Aberrant. While most of the ship's machinery doesn't seem to have received heavy damage, weapons fire must have hit the slug's vital organs, killing it, after which point the ship seems to have stopped working. Unlike with the Aberrant, you feel no strange presence or ominous feelings as you approach - it is merely a dead animal.`
	"CN-14703" `	You have no troubles docking with its "exoskeleton," trying to decide what to do next. While the Ka'het is too different from a normal ship for you to command it, it's safe to say that you can now loot its outfits.`
	"CN-14704" `Do you want to ask the Remnant about the section of space south of the Ember Wastes, the Graveyard, and its inhabitants?`
	"CN-14705" `	(Not now.)`
	"CN-14706" `	You ask around more than a dozen people, but none of them seems to be aware of what you're talking about. Either the information is too confidential to be given to a stranger like you, or you didn't ask the right people.`
	"CN-14707" `	You ask around more than a dozen people, but none of them seems to be aware of what you're talking about. Perhaps you might have more luck asking Taely on Viminal.`
	"CN-14708" `Do you want to ask Taely about the section of space south of the Ember Wastes, the Graveyard, and its inhabitants?`
	"CN-14709" `	You find Taely inside one of the outer hangars of the shipyard, apparently teaching a small group of people how to make basic repairs on an Albatross. You sit on a bench waiting for her to finish her lesson, after which she walks over to you. "Hello, <first>!" she says. "Is there something I can help you with?"`
	"CN-14710" `	"I'm here because I need to ask you a few questions," you reply.`
	"CN-14711" `	As she sits near you, you start explaining to her the area you reached, including the weird alien ships that attacked you with weapons similar to the ones the Remnant possess, although this doesn't seem to be news for her. "We know of the existence of the Ka'het, the aliens you encountered, since we first reached the Ember Wastes. We found many of their shells within our planets, crashed there thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of years before our arrival, but some of their outfits survived long enough for us to reverse engineer these advanced technologies."`
	"CN-14712" `	"Then," she continues, "a few hundred years ago, a scout fleet arrived in a system where some Ka'het were still alive. They attacked our fleet instantly with EMP Torpedoes that quickly disabled two Starlings. The Starlings couldn't recover quickly enough to survive, and the only remaining ship could do nothing but flee as soon as possible."`
	"CN-14713" `	"Which technology did you recover from the crashed Ka'het?"`
	"CN-14714" `	"Wait, why did you call them 'shells' and not ships?"`
	"CN-14715" `	"Have the Ka'het ever attacked the Remnant planets?"`
	"CN-14716" `	"Actually, we never met any living Ka'het in the Ember Waste at all. The shells we found had similar capabilities to the quantum keystone, meaning they could pass through the wormholes, so we don't know for sure why they remained in the Graveyard. Perhaps they aren't aware of their skills, or maybe they lost them over time."`
	"CN-14717" `	"Back then we found large numbers of their EMP Torpedoes, most of which were in nearly pristine condition; their internal mechanisms were also simple enough that we were able to reproduce them perfectly. We couldn't do the same with the other surviving systems in the shells, but their tech has been a source of inspiration for centuries."`
	"CN-14718" `	"You see, <first>," she says, "the Ka'het aren't normal spaceships. The debris we found were artificial exoskeletons, built around huge living beings; it's unlikely a species that big could have developed that sort of technology, so we presume someone must have created it for them. We call them the Builders.`
	"CN-14719" `	"After we lost the first scout ships in the Graveyard, the prefects decided that we should continue to scout the region but take necessary precautions. Thanks to those protocols, some of which are still applied today, we were able to extensively explore most of the Graveyard and decipher a good amount of the written language we found. There is still much we have yet to discover."`
	"CN-14720" `	You discuss the Graveyard with Taely for a while longer until one of the people she was talking to earlier comes closer and shows her something on a data pad. "I have to go now, Captain," she tells you. "Good luck."`
	"CN-14721" `When you enter this suspiciously empty system, your attention is drawn to your ship's scanners. The proximity detection system is going off, suggesting that something sizable is close to your ship, although whatever it is you can't see it as you look out your cockpit.`
	"CN-14722" `	You turn your ship around and open the hatch of your cargo hold, catching the object. When you go to inspect it, you see a small, extremely dark piece of debris that almost looks to be covered in vantablack, but it doesn't resemble any alloy you've seen on a spaceship or station, bearing semblance to both a crystal and a metallic structure.`
	"CN-14723" `	In one particular corner you see that there is a small, barely recognizable tube, badly damaged but with a few intact wires creeping out. After tinkering a bit with the wires, you manage to connect the debris to your ship's secondary power systems. It barely uses any energy at all, but you can feel the air around it starting to get slightly colder.`
	"CN-14724" `	You unplug it and store the debris in a separate part of your ship. Maybe some alien species could tell you about it, if you were to bring it to them.`
	"CN-14725" `Do you want to show the Remnant the piece of debris you found in the abandoned, empty system, and ask them what they know about it?`
	"CN-14726" `	A group of Remnant researchers quickly come to your ship when you mention you've found an odd piece of technology, but look disappointed and some even frown when they see the debris, as you explain the system you found it and how it reacted to being fed some energy.`
	"CN-14727" `	"We've found many fragments like this one drifting in that system over the decades. It could maybe improve our cooling systems, but we could never begin to comprehend how it works," one of them says.`
	"CN-14728" `	They say they don't know any more than you do about the object, but ask that you share with them any information on how it works, should you find out.`
	"CN-14729" `Do you want to show the Hai the piece of debris you found in the abandoned, empty system, and ask them what they know about it?`
	"CN-14730" `	You ask around for a bit, and eventually are lead to a workshop where some Hai engineers and shipwrights are gathered.`
	"CN-14731" `	"Greetings, human friend! How may we help you?"`
	"CN-14732" `	You show them the piece of debris, and they observe it for a bit, but after just a few minutes of handling it they conclude they don't have the necessary equipment to analyze it.`
	"CN-14733" `	"Sorry, whatever it is that you've found, it is too advanced a technology for our systems," they say. You thank them for their time, and head back to your ship.`
	"CN-14734" `Do you want to show the members of the Coalition the piece of debris you found in the abandoned, empty system, and ask them what they know about it?`
	"CN-14735" `	After asking around, you're directed to a large Heliarch building, where several of them are standing guard, weapons in hand, while others are performing maintenance on a chunk of hull plating. Judging by its size, it may be a warehouse for their weapons and outfits. "Of assistance how may we be, kind visitor?" One of the agents asks.`
	"CN-14736" `	You show them the debris, and explain where you've found it. They are shocked when they see it, but don't attempt to perform any tests on it. "A piece of Quarg technology, this is!" they say, asking again for you to explain where exactly you found it, as they make sure to write it all down this time.`
	"CN-14737" `	They then say that they have experience with technology they managed to steal from the Quarg during their war, and that the debris is the remnant of a somewhat common component of Quarg equipment. They also note that what you've found has deteriorated much compared to what they have acquired for themselves, and that it most likely can't even reach a fraction of its optimal cooling output.`
	"CN-14738" `	You thank them for their time and the explanation, and head back to your ship.`
	"CN-14739" `Do you want to show the Quarg the piece of debris you found in the abandoned, empty system, and ask them what they know about it?`
	"CN-14740" `	Walking down the principal, alien-looking hall, you decide to stop one of the few Quarg you see there. "Hello, human. How may I be of service?" the Quarg says. You show it the piece of debris, and ask what it knows about it. It is momentarily stunned when you show the dark piece of technology, calmly taking it into its own hands after recovering. "A fragment of our ships, is what it is. A remnant of part of our equipment. Thank you for returning it to us."`
	"CN-14741" `	You continue by telling it about your travels in the section of the galaxy where you found the debris, and asking what it knows of the place and the hostiles that inhabit it.`
	"CN-14742" `	"Ah, you encountered the remains of the Builders. Millennia ago, they were a flourishing and thoughtful empire, but hostile contacts forced them to grow fearful and hawkish. Although they never did attack us, they always refrained from accepting our aid, and attempted to relocate a greater distance from us and our ringworld there, in worlds easier to maintain than ones they were closer to."`
	"CN-14743" `	"Who were these hostile contacts?"`
	"CN-14744" `	"What happened to the Builders?"`
	"CN-14745" `	"Long ago, few ships coming from a foreign species had reached that region of space, using some of the wormholes leading there. They belonged to a young race who foolishly decided to attack the Builders instead of learning from them. Their ships were stronger than any vessel the Builders possessed at the time, but were also few enough in number to be destroyed by the Builders."`
	"CN-14746" `	"What happened after that?"`
	"CN-14747" `	The Quarg stops for a few seconds before continuing, as if it was reflecting on something. "For many millennia they grew, developing brilliant pieces of technology. Then, compelled by their past experiences, they began creating weapons not only to defend themselves, but also to retaliate; these 'Ka'het,' as they named them, turned on their creators shortly after they were complete.`
	"CN-14748" `	"For a few more centuries the Builders lasted, before falling under their very own hubris. Their space is still populated by the Ka'het they gave birth to through the immense facilities they assembled, a being that does not yet possess a vast intelligence." The Quarg bows, still holding on to the piece of debris, and seems to be preparing to walk away.`
	"CN-14749" `	"What happened to your ringworld in the Graveyard? Was it in the system I found that thing?"`
	"CN-14750" `	(Let the Quarg walk away.)`
	"CN-14751" `	For the briefest moment, you see patches of skin all over the Quarg's body radically shift from the usual gray to red and blue, some spots mixing into purple, and you could have sworn you saw some part of the iris on its eyes "open" very slightly.`
	"CN-14752" `	After coming back to normal, it ponders for a second, then says, "It was in that system, and it was lost, millennia after the Builders had perished."`
	"CN-14753" `	It doesn't seem too inclined on answering any more questions, and swiftly walks away.`
	"CN-14754" `As the jumping sequence comes to an end, you find yourself orbiting a small black hole, surrounded by nothing but countless asteroids and debris. Even more interesting is the fact that the asteroid belt appears to be populated by small spaceships, similar in appearance to the Ka'het that infest the nearby systems but at the same time unlike any of the types you had seen before. Perhaps the Remnant can tell you more about this system and its sudden appearance.`
	"CN-14755" `Do you want to look for Taely to tell her about the new system that appeared in the Graveyard?`
	"CN-14756" `	You aren't surprised to find Taely in the local shipyard, overseeing the welding of some kind of unmanned satellite. Though not familiar enough with Remnant technology to understand its function, you identify a large crystal placed near what you presume to be the front of the probe as a Quantum Key Stone, or at least a derivative of it.`
	"CN-14757" `	When Taely notices you walking towards her, she waves at you. "<first>! It has been a while. Were you looking for me?"`
	"CN-14758" `	"I have some news. A new black hole suddenly appeared near the Graveyard, the same way Ssil Vida did."`
	"CN-14759" `	"What's the purpose of that satellite?"`
	"CN-14760" `	"She is a beauty, is she not? The discovery of the star systems beyond Postverta spurred a large request for exploration probes, more than we've had in decades. This one was my own proposal: she is going to make precise LIDAR scans of the four planets most similar to the worlds we found alien settlements on, searching for relics and ancient artifacts! It is unbelievably exciting to see an idea that you came up with become reality right in front of you."`
	"CN-14761" `	She pauses to stare at the probe with pride.`
	"CN-14762" `	"Funny you mention Postverta," you say. "A new black hole has just appeared near the Graveyard, the same way Ssil Vida did."`
	"CN-14763" `	You try to explain the system and its inhabitants as best you can. Taely looks intrigued. "Can you show me what your ship recorded of that system?" she asks. After spending a few minutes checking your ship's registers, she appears even more astonished than before. "This is incredible! It opens so many questions. What if it was the Builders who built Ssil Vida? We thought they never left the Graveyard, but this could change everything. And look at the gravitational slipstreams: this system has no hyperlane connections, at least for the moment. We need to know more." She pauses for a second to think. "Come with me, <first>."`
	"CN-14764" `	You follow Taely into a large elevator at the other end of the building. After a short trip, you find yourself in a large underground hangar, full of oddly shaped dishes and complex pieces of machinery. "We use these old shelters to store the parts we do not need anymore. Sometimes they are still handy for replacing broken machinery, so instead of disassembling them we keep them here for a few years. And this," she says, pointing at an array of cylindrical objects, "is the reason we are here."`
	"CN-14765" `	"What is that?"`
	"CN-14766" `	"A bunch of rods?"`
	"CN-14767" `	"It is an old tracking and surveillance device, developed specifically for the Graveyard," she says. "It was supposed to track all Ka'het it could find and make detailed imagery of their actions, in order to find the patterns that they follow or ways to exploit their controls. The mission was a long-term one, so when an urgent project came up, resources were diverted away from it, leaving some sensors unused.`
	"CN-14768" `	"My plan is to install some in the <ship> and go to <waypoints> to find out more about the ships there. It needs to be calibrated precisely before use, but luckily for you, I was the person who developed the deployment procedures," she says with a smirk on her face. "Are you ready?"`
	"CN-14769" `	"How did the attempt at tracking the Ka'het go?"`
	"CN-14770" `	"Sorry, but I can't help you this time. You're going to have to find somebody else."`
	"CN-14771" `	"Oh, the scanner is working perfectly. But the Ka'het, as far as we could see, seem to follow no patterns but the most basic ones. I guess you could compare them to simple animals, searching for food and fighting each other for their territory. They seem to have some sort of 'imprinting' towards the stations that breed them, but other than that, they have not shown any other particular behavior yet."`
	"CN-14772" `	"Alright, let's mount the scanner!"`
	"CN-14773" `	Taely replies, "I will gather a team to install the scanning system. We should be done in around an hour." She leaves the warehouse carrying a scanner, leaving you to prepare your ship for the upcoming mission.`
	"CN-14774" `When you enter the system, Taely is already sitting at the scanner's control console. She starts counting loudly. "External deployment in three... two... one... trackers out. Initiating startup sequence." She begins typing commands on a keyboard. "This is going to take a while, <first>," she says, without taking her eyes off the screen. "It is not normally a one-person job."`
	"CN-14775" `	"I'll wait for you to finish in the cockpit."`
	"CN-14776" `	"I am afraid there is not. Give me, say, half an hour and I will have the results ready."`
	"CN-14777" `	Almost an hour passes, but Taely finally responds. "The scan is complete. The system is currently processing all the data it gathered into something usable; there's nothing we can do but wait." She starts staring out of the cockpit windows. "Black holes are such a wonderful phenomenon. They are so mysterious, and each one is peculiar in its own way, this one especially."`
	"CN-14778" `	"Did you find anything new on how this system appeared?"`
	"CN-14779" `	"Was this one already known to the Remnant?"`
	"CN-14780" `	"That is the oddest part; it was not. We knew about the existence of the stars beyond Postverta as they could be observed from our own systems; they just were not reachable with a jump drive. But, from what I can tell from these readings, Patir did not exist until a short time ago.`
	"CN-14781" `	"Do you have anything on why this system appeared?" you ask.`
	"CN-14782" `	"I only have theories for now, none of which can be confirmed. People more knowledgeable than me in the subject are examining the phenomenon right now. But look at this," she says, opening a star map on a holographic projector. "This white dot is Postverta, and we are here. When Ssil Vida first appeared, it released a strong burst of ionizing radiation, and when we were able to calculate its velocity, we found it was going much faster than the speed of light. It is gradually slowing down, so it will not go much further, but exactly the same day that the energy burst was supposed to arrive here, Patir appeared! It would be an incredible coincidence if the two events were not connected.`
	"CN-14783" `	"We have even less information about how this system disappeared. If I may venture a guess, I would say that the black hole is involved. The Builders never seemed to possess the ability to make a system disappear, and we have seen in the past that some black holes can render any hyperlane they are connected to inaccessible given enough time. Perhaps a young, non-rotating black hole like this one can do even more. There is a part of me that thinks this system could disappear again any moment, but if anything that motivates me to find as much as we can about it in the time we have," she says with a wink.`
	"CN-14784" `	"Wait, are we in danger?"`
	"CN-14785" `	"How much will it take to finish processing the data?"`
	"CN-14786" `	"Oh, I was just letting my imagination fly. There are thousands of other explanations that are as good as mine, none of which include such a tragic ending. But we can ponder more on those explanations on the way back to <planet>."`
	"CN-14787" `	"It will take some time before the data is completely analyzed. We should return to <planet> before looking it over, as it should be done by then."`
	"CN-14788" `Upon your return to <planet>, Taely immediately begins browsing through several images on her console that were compiled by the sensors.`
	"CN-14789" `	"Look at these, <first>. What do you see?" The first image shows a ship like the others you've seen in Patir working on some kind of small structure. In the following pictures, presumably depicting different iterations of the same ship, the structure becomes gradually bigger and more complex until the last one, where a Ka'het-like slug is shown growing inside this shell.`
	"CN-14790" `	"The ships, the Fetri'sei, are Von Neumann probes," she says. "Self replicating spacecraft. Unlike the Ka'het, which we found to be unable to reproduce and can only be created in a factory, the Ka'sei can duplicate their own structure with the material harvested from the local asteroids. The process probably takes years, or more, but it is still an incredible achievement."`
	"CN-14791" `	"If they can duplicate themselves, why aren't there more Ka'sei?"`
	"CN-14792" `	"If the Builders were able to make self replicating spacecrafts, why aren't the Ka'het like that as well?"`
	"CN-14793" `	"If they were able to get to Patir, does this suggest they have jump drives?"`
	"CN-14794" `	"Why aren't they in other systems?"`
	"CN-14795" `	"I imagine the problem would be with their lifespan. The Ka'het can survive for a few hundred years once they become operational; these could potentially last for a much shorter time. Another important factor is that we do not know what happened here in the millennia the system was hidden. Perhaps the Ka'sei went into hibernation waiting for the system to appear again."`
	"CN-14796" `	Taely looks towards the console again. On the screen a tactical view of the Fetri'sei appears. "Well, consider that the Ka'het are true battleships, heavily shielded and always with their weapons ready. These are more akin to reconnaissance and mining probes. Their structure is extremely weak, and they do not have any weapons except the equipment necessary to mine asteroids. I imagine it would take decades for even just a Maeri'het to replicate itself.`
	"CN-14797" `	"There is also the tactical problem: forcing a Ka'het to spend such a long time building copies of itself makes them vulnerable to enemy attacks and unable to effectively fight back, making them ill-suited for the job."`
	"CN-14798" `	"They do not have any drives on board, not even a hyperdrive. Limited to sub-light velocity, they would need hundreds of years to pass from one system to another, which is a testament to the Builders' patience. Most species we have encountered abandon any form of sub-light transportation between star systems immediately after developing hyperdrive technology. For all we know, the Ember Waste could have been visited by these Fetri'sei or some other Ka'sei, but they had to leave for some reason we are not aware of. The last Builder died almost 100,000 years ago - so long that having a clear idea of what happened is impossible."`
	"CN-14799" `	"What's the difference between Ka'sei and Fetri'sei?"`
	"CN-14800" `	"Well, there is no difference," Taely responds, "not in this case at least. The naming scheme the Builders used is a bit odd: we know that 'Ka,' in their language, has a meaning close to the one of 'group,' 'team,' and sometimes even 'ring,' although it can never be used without a name next to it. So we have 'group mar,' 'group het,' and so on. These are not limited to spaceships: the Ka'het, for example, includes both the biological spacecrafts around the Graveyard and the stations that constructs them, while until now we thought that the Ka'sei included only a handful of large scale construction projects. We know 'Fetri' to be a sort of spaceship sub-classification, but we are not aware of its exact meaning. So the Fetri'sei, or 'ship sei' are a part of the Ka'sei, or 'group sei.' To put it simply, it is similar to how all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares. It just so happens that everything in this system is classified as a Fetri'sei, so we can use either interchangeably.`
	"CN-14801" `	"I know someone who will want to see all this. Meet me in the spaceport when you have the chance."`
	"CN-14802" `	"I know someone who will want to see all this. You have met Dusk, correct?"`
	"CN-14803" `	You nod. "I have, but I believe he's busy at the moment."`
	"CN-14804" `	"That is unfortunate. You should show this to him as soon as he is available," Taely responds. "But I fear I now have to go back to my job now, Captain. I would love to continue the exploration with you, but there are more pressing issues I have to resolve at the moment. I will keep an eye on the activity in Patir, I promise."`
	"CN-14805" `You find Taely waiting for you in the spaceport alongside a young Remnant with a touchpad. They both wave as you approach.`
	"CN-14806" `	"Captain!" Taely says. "Let me introduce you to Dusk. He is a young researcher who specializes in xenoarchaeology and astrobiology. Dusk, this is <first>, the captain who I told you about earlier. Now I'll leave you two to your work, as I fear I have to go back to my job now. I would love to continue the exploration with you both, but there are more pressing issues I have to resolve at the moment. I will keep an eye on the activity in Patir, I promise. May the embers burn bright for you both."`
	"CN-14807" `	As Taely wanders off, you turn to Dusk. "Nice to meet you, Captain!" he says.`
	"CN-14808" `	"Dusk? Are names like that common?"`
	"CN-14809" `	"Pleased to meet you too, Dusk."`
	"CN-14810" `	"You mean names of the various phases of daylight? Mmm, I would not say they are common, but nor are they rare, either. Our ancestors devoted their lives, one way or another, to studying the stars and the everchanging light of the universe. It should not be surprising that their vocabulary should be so entwined in our culture.`
	"CN-14811" `You find Taely waiting for you in the spaceport alongside Dusk. They both wave as you approach.`
	"CN-14812" `	"Captain!" Taely says. "I believe you already know Dusk. Dusk, I think you should find this to be right in your area of interest. Now I'll leave you two to your work, as I fear I have to go back to my job now. I would love to continue the exploration with you both, but there are more pressing issues I have to resolve at the moment. I will keep an eye on the activity in Patir, I promise. May the embers burn bright for you both."`
	"CN-14813" `	As Taely wanders off, you turn to Dusk. "Nice to see you again, Captain!" he says.`
	"CN-14814" `Dusk is no longer busy. Do you want to contact him about Patir, the black hole system in the Graveyard that appeared out of nowhere?`
	"CN-14815" `	You contact Dusk, and he agrees to meet you in the cafeteria. When you spot him, he waves to you. "Nice to meet you again, Captain!" he says.`
	"CN-14816" `	"Good to see you too, Dusk."`
	"CN-14817" `	"Has Taely told you about what we found?"`
	"CN-14818" `	"Yes, a new system has appeared in the Graveyard. How exciting! Taely sent me the data as soon as she could.`
	"CN-14819" `	"I have found something interesting in the data Taely sent me, Captain." Dusk shows you a map of the system Patir with various lines drawn all over it. "This image shows the route followed by every Ka'sei the scanner was able to track. At first sight they do not seem to have much in common, right? However, upon closer examination, there is something consistent about almost every path: once in a while, every ship spends a few minutes on a single asteroid - one of the biggest in the entire asteroid belt.`
	"CN-14820" `	"However, this could have easily been just a coincidence; it takes a lot of effort to extract resources from asteroids that size, so maybe they were just combining their forces to harvest it. So, at this point I had an idea." The screen on the touchpad changes, now showing raw numbers separated on a spreadsheet. "The sensors you carried to Patir had various functions, one of which was a high power asteroid scanner. The asteroid in particular was shown to be extremely rich in a particular metal, iridium. There is more iridium in it than the whole of half a dozen Ember Waste systems, planets included. However, here is the odd part: the concentration of iridium on the asteroid when you jumped away was not lower than when the scanning begun, it was higher! For whatever reason, the Fetri'sei are depositing iridium on the asteroid."`
	"CN-14821" `	"Are you sure that it isn't just an error in the measurement?"`
	"CN-14822" `	"Why are they doing that?"`
	"CN-14823" `	"Well, it is a possibility; this instrumentation has not been tested in years. But if it is not, this could give us a lot of insight on the real purpose of these Ka'sei and why they are around that black hole. It is at least worth studying!`
	"CN-14824" `	"That is what we are going to find out together! The only way we can find insights on their real purpose is to study this asteroid and what the Ka'sei are doing there.`
	"CN-14825" `	"The plan is to take a short range high power scanner and map the entire asteroid to analyze the site where the Ka'sei are bringing the iridium. After you have made extensive scans of the sites I indicate to you, reach me back here on <origin> so that I can analyze the data. If everything goes well, you should be back here in a couple weeks. Now I have already directed the spaceport engineers to install the scanners on your ship. I almost can't wait to see what you find there!" Dusk is so excited that he leaves before you can respond.`
	"CN-14826" `After a brief scan of the system, your ship's computers identify the asteroid that Dusk talked about. Compared to the asteroids you are used to, this one is orders of magnitude bigger, almost the size of a small moon. Land on <planet> in order to get close enough for the short range scanner to analyze it.`
	"CN-14827" `Your initial scans suggest that the asteroid is slowly rotating like a moon or planet. You set your ship on a polar orbit around it and activate the sensors that Dusk gave you, hopefully to find some answers to all the questions raised by Patir's mysterious appearance.`
	"CN-14828" `	You start your exploration from the dark side of the asteroid, and from the little you can see, its surface appears to be completely covered in regolith of little importance. But soon after passing the terminator, you see an extremely reflective patch near the horizon. As you get closer, it becomes clear that this is the storage of iridium that Dusk was talking about: an enormous solidified lake of the reflective metal extending for kilometers in every direction inside a gigantic hole the Ka'sei have dug in the terrain.`
	"CN-14829" `	In a few hours, you are able to check every site you were told to scan, but most of the surface still remains an unknown.`
	"CN-14830" `	(Continue my exploration of the asteroid.)`
	"CN-14831" `	(Leave and return to Aventine.)`
	"CN-14832" `	As you are preparing to jump away, an artificial structure near the edge of the iridium storage catches your eye, and you decide to bring your ship in closer.`
	"CN-14833" `	While you are setting up a new route to pass above as much terrain as possible, your eye is caught by an artificial structure near the edge of the iridium storage.`
	"CN-14834" `	The first thing you notice is an array of extremely tall pylons arranged into two parallel lines. When you approach to get a better angle, you discover a large cupola towering over the area. Although understanding its scale without a reference point is hard, you estimate it must be at least a kilometer in diameter.`
	"CN-14835" `	You wonder if you should get closer, but the Ka'sei may not take kindly to you approaching their structure.`
	"CN-14836" `	(Collect measurements at a safe distance.)`
	"CN-14837" `	(Go near the structure, regardless of the risk.)`
	"CN-14838" `	The data that Dusk's scanners will gather will not be perfect, but it is better than having to risk getting close to something you know so little about. After a few minutes, the scan completes, and you are ready to return to <planet>.`
	"CN-14839" `	You carefully position your ship above the structure and activate the sensors. As the scan proceeds, you monitor the position of the Ka'sei fleet. Some of the Fetri'sei nearest to you have stopped their standard activities and are standing by, perhaps observing your actions the same way you are observing theirs. Luckily, after a few minutes the sensors complete their analysis of the structure and you are ready to return to <planet> unmolested.`
	"CN-14840" `Near the landing area, you discuss with Dusk what you have found next to the iridium storage. "This is fantastic! It is so much more than I hoped to find with this expedition. Give me a few hours to analyze the data and meet me in the spaceport."`
	"CN-14841" `You meet Dusk again in the cafeteria with his touchpad, as usual. "Thank you again for your help, <first>. There is a lot we can learn about the Builders with this discovery." He shows you a black and white image of a building inside a hemispherical dome. The complex appears to be made of interconnected cylinders, presumably habitation modules.`
	"CN-14842" `	"Oh, it is the scan you made of the Builder structure. Here, look: the external cupola is completely pressurized, which could give us insights about the biology of the Builders. The composition of the atmosphere on their planets is likely to have changed after so much time, and every manned station the Ka'het could reach was long destroyed. This is the first time we have the possibility to study the gases they could breathe without having the results compromised by millennia of biological activity. Inside the cupola there is also a large intact complex, which could give us more answers about all of this.`
	"CN-14843" `	"If you can bring me to the asteroid, I could be able use the controls and enter in the cupola to measure the composition of the atmosphere."`
	"CN-14844" `	"I'm ready to go."`
	"CN-14845" `	"Wait, are you saying that you can read the Builder language?"`
	"CN-14846" `	"Very approximately, but yes. We have been studying every piece of written language we could find from their cities, mostly inside sealed containers. It is very hard to understand full phrases or even what they mean at times, but we can reliably translate most of the common words and phrases, which will hopefully be enough for our mission."`
	"CN-14847" `As you approach the structure, Dusk stops preparing the equipment to observe it from the window. "It is a fascinating structure. I've only seen a small number of Builder buildings, but this looks different from anything I have seen. Perhaps it is more structurally similar to their stations than their outposts given the almost negligible gravity, or they had other asteroid colonies that have been gradually lost over time. It would be worth doing a serious exploration of the asteroid belts in the Graveyard at some point."`
	"CN-14848" `	"You have been on Builder planets?"`
	"CN-14849" `	"How far have the Remnant explored the Graveyard?"`
	"CN-14850" `	"Do you have all the equipment ready?"`
	"CN-14851" `	"I presume Taely already told you about the troubled beginnings we had in exploring the area; as a consequence of that, we had to reevaluate the procedures for exploring the nearby systems and species, especially beyond the Ossipago wormhole. Every scout ship entering the area has to always remain cloaked to prevent attacks from the countless Ka'het patrolling the area; this means that the further we need to travel to reach the destination, the more fuel we have to spend to return home, which considerably impacts the time we can spend cloaked in the destination. Some of the systems at the other end of the Graveyard have seen very few Starlings, most of them staying for less than a day.`
	"CN-14852" `	"Still, even with these limitations we were able to make considerable progress. We can read some of the words in their language, and we were able to retrieve a countless number of partly intact Builder artifacts. Perhaps some day we will be able to understand how to control the Ka'het. Who knows?`
	"CN-14853" `	"Oh I have, many times. I have never been on a Builder station, but on a few occasions I have participated to expeditions to newly discovered cities or semi-submersed bunkers. I presume Taely already told you about the troubled beginnings we had in exploring the area; as a consequence of that, we had to reevaluate the procedures for exploring the nearby systems and species, especially beyond the Ossipago wormhole. Every scout ship entering the area has to always remain cloaked for safety; this means that exploring planets is only possible for a limited time and that you cannot leave your ship if you do not have a means of hiding yourself from them.`
	"CN-14854" `	"Because of this, most of the planetary exploration is done with robotic probes. The Ka'het are able to detect and destroy devices that use faster than light communication, so only remote control with a Starling in the same system is possible. There are a lot of compromises that must be taken, but we can still make considerable progress even with these restrictions.`
	"CN-14855" `	"I need to prepare a few more instruments before we land," Dusk says as he stops staring at the dome and returns to his equipment. As you reach the complex, you do a few flights around it in search for a good landing site. Dusk points out a spot right next to a set of small circular indentations on the structure. After touching down, you and Dusk don extravehicular suits and start walking towards the cupola. He stops in front of a ring on its surface and starts looking through his equipment.`
	"CN-14856" `	"Well, I obviously cannot be sure, but given its location and that on the other side there is a pressurized area, it should be an airlock. I have seen scans of the Builder stations, and they look quite similar." He takes a heavy-looking scanner, puts it on the wall of the structure and starts moving it around. "If I am right, this way should have a control station hidden inside the wall - and here it is!" he sings with satisfaction.`
	"CN-14857" `	Using a small instrument similar in appearance to a crowbar, Dusk slowly pulls out a section from the wall, kicking off a good amount of dust in the process. The control station is a two-sided panel, full of switches and buttons with small alien markings above each of them.`
	"CN-14858" `	"Can you read them?"`
	"CN-14859" `	"Can you open the airlock?"`
	"CN-14860" `	"Are you sure this won't put us in danger?"`
	"CN-14861" `	"I can, yes. The first row of switches controls the lights inside the complex, the second row controls redundant pressurization systems, and there are similar such operations controlled by the rest of the panel.`
	"CN-14862" `	"There is no way to be certain, but this is the only possible way to get in without destroying half of the complex.`
	"CN-14863" `	"This," Dusk says as he presses a switch in the middle of the panel, "is what we were looking for." Soon after, the door in front of you opens, revealing a small room with another door at the opposite end. You follow Dusk inside, where he takes out the scanner again to look for another control panel. Once that is open, another switch allows him to close the door. Only the lights on your helmet keep you from being submerged in complete darkness. Looking around, you notice that the architecture is distinctly alien, with rounded angles on every side of the room and buttresses on either side of the doors. The ring itself is too small for you to pass through it standing upright, but the low gravity of the asteroid lets you almost fly through it without much trouble. "We now have to wait for the room to pressurize," he tells you.`
	"CN-14864" `	"How long do you think it will it take?"`
	"CN-14865" `	"Would it be safe to remove our helmets after that?"`
	"CN-14866" `	"I have no idea. Usually it is a matter of a few minutes, but we know next to nothing about this tech. We will have to wait and see. In the meanwhile," he says as he begins to activate another scanner, "I can analyze the atmosphere that is starting to fill this room. It should save us some time to do it here, as well as being safer, should it be dangerous to our suits."`
	"CN-14867" `	Dusk gives you an odd look. "Of course not <first>; it would almost certainly kill you. Such an alien atmosphere is unlikely to be breathable for a human, and even if it was we could not be sure until we analyze it extensively." He begins to activate another scanner, "Speaking of which, I can start analyzing the atmosphere that is starting to fill this room. It should save us some time to do it here, as well as also safer, should it be dangerous to our suits."`
	"CN-14868" `	Dusk continues working on the atmospheric analyzer for about five minutes without anything happening. You try to connect to the scanner on your ship to check the position of the nearby Fetri'sei, but the dome seems to jam all communication with the outside. Suddenly, you hear a loud "pop," and the door that leads inside the dome recesses a few centimeters. "Just in time," Dusk says. "My analysis of the atmosphere has finished. Let us go take a look inside." After a brief look at the writing on the door, he grabs a handle on it and slides it to the left. The hatch starts to slowly open inwards. When you come closer to the entrance you are instantly blinded by a strong light coming from the other side of the door. After lowering the sun shield on your helmet, your eyes start adapting to the new light level, and it takes you a few seconds to realize what is now in front of you. Landed inside the cupola, right in front of the airlock, is a Fetri'sei - a Ka'sei probe - pointed at you and Dusk.`
	"CN-14869" `	Both you and Dusk stand still in front of it without saying a word. Out of the corner of your eye, you can see his hands shivering. All of a sudden, the Ka'sei starts emitting a very high pitched sound, very hard to hear, frequently changing in intensity. This lasts only for a few seconds, then abruptly stops.`
	"CN-14870" `	(Run back in the airlock.)`
	"CN-14871" `	(Stay still and wait.)`
	"CN-14872" `	The whole cupola falls silent. What feels like hours pass before the Ka'sei swiftly lifts off in front of you, hovering a few meters above the terrain. Just like the previous time, it starts emitting the same sequence of sounds as the last time, followed by a clicking sound. Dusk turns towards you.`
	"CN-14873" `	(Keep staying still.)`
	"CN-14874" `	(Try shooting at the hover engines of the Ka'sei with my sidearm.)`
	"CN-14875" `	You take out your gun and start aiming for the Fetri'sei's side pods. Your first shot misses it completely, but after that you are able to make three full hits on the hover engines. Almost instantly, the Ka'sei starts emitting a loud siren. The ship fires a beam just to the left of you, letting out an ear-piercing wail. Both you and Dusk jump back to the airlock as fast as possible, but you are too far away to reach it in time before a Ravager beam tears through your suit. The last thing you see is Dusk closing the airlock.`
	"CN-14876" `	After another short silence, the Ka'sei starts emitting a loud siren. You hear the screech of Ravager fire as an angry energy beam sears through the air to your left, just barely missing you. Both you and Dusk jump back to the airlock, slamming the door closed. You can still feel the crackle of the Ravager cannons from the other side the door, and after a second, the door begins to glow.`
	"CN-14877" `	(Open the exit door, even with the airlock full of air.)`
	"CN-14878" `	(Wait for the airlock to empty.)`
	"CN-14879" `	After waiting a few seconds, Dusk hurries towards the control station. "Hold on to something, I ha-" Suddenly, he is interrupted by a burst of light coming from where the door of the airlock used to be. Your suit provides little protection from the full force of the Ravager beams.`
	"CN-14880" `	You reach the control station as fast as you can and press the switch that Dusk had used when you first came in. The blast is not as strong as you imagined, but in a few seconds you are thrown out of the airlock by the sheer force of the air leaving from the breach. Both of you touch down after a few meters, crashing hard in the terrain that surrounds the cupola. Out of the corner of your eye, you see that there's still air coming out of the airlock, signifying that the interior door has been breached. It is very lucky that your suit has not been punctured.`
	"CN-14881" `	Looking around, you see Dusk laying face down next to you. Thankfully, he begins to stand up as you approach him. When he sees you, he silently pauses for a moment, before jerking his head to the airlock and signing. "We need to run. It could get out of the cupola, or others could arrive, and here in the open we are even easier targets." You nod and start going with him back to your ship.`
	"CN-14882" `	Running at full speed, it takes the two of you only a few minutes to reach the <ship>. Once safely in the cockpit, you sit down to catch your breath. After a moment, Dusk begins searching nervously for something on his suit. He takes out the atmospheric scanner he used earlier, but the screen is cracked and the external sensors are bent. "It must have been destroyed when we fell on the ground. I hope that at least its memory is still intact."`
	"CN-14883" `	You start running towards the airlock as fast as you can. Initially, Dusk tries to resist, but you drag him by force and lock the door behind you. Everything falls into silence again for half a minute while you are waiting for the room to depressurize, but suddenly the sound of a Ravager cannon cuts through the silence, and the inner airlock door begins to glow as it takes fire.`
	"CN-14884" `	After a few seconds of waiting, Dusk hurries towards the control station. "I have an idea," he says as he presses a few switches on the panel. "I can open a vent to expel the air out of here into the void, and get us out of here in a few seconds."`
	"CN-14885" `	You reach the control station as fast as you can and tell Dusk to hold on to something, but he stops you. "I have a better idea," he says as he presses a few switches on the panel. "I can open a vent to expel the air out of here into the void, and get us out of here in a few seconds."`
	"CN-14886" `	Soon after, the frontal door recedes. You two run out of the airlock as fast as possible. Behind you, you hear the roar of metal melting as a rush of air passes you by. You start running back to your ship with Dusk, hoping that the Ka'sei will not get out of the building before you are safe.`
	"CN-14887" `	Running at full speed, it takes the two of you only a few minutes to reach the <ship>. Once safely in the cockpit, you sit down to catch your breath. After a moment, Dusk begins searching nervously for something on his suit. He takes out the atmospheric scanner he used earlier and turns it on. "Phew. I was afraid it had broken down when we had to run away, but maybe we can still get the data we need."`
	"CN-14888" `	Dusk is interrupted by the shrieking wail of your ship's proximity alert as a hostile object appears on the radar screen. As Dusk suspected, the Fetri'sei must have tracked your movements after leaving the cupola. You start to ready your ship for combat, but Dusk interrupts you. "You cannot kill them, <first>. Do you remember the high pitched sound it emitted before shooting? He was trying to speak with us, Captain. Only a few words, maybe even pre-programmed for this kind of interaction, but still a complete phrase or more in pure Builder language. In decades of xenoarchaeological research, this is the first time that it occurs. These ships are an incredible discovery. They may be the only thing still capable of speaking that language in the entire Graveyard. You cannot destroy it, and disabling one is more a matter of luck than skill."`
	"CN-14889" `	"What should I do then?"`
	"CN-14890" `	"Well, I can only suggest to depart from here and set a route straight back to Aventine, while avoiding the Ka'sei. Sorry <first>, but it is preferable that we leave them alone." After all the risk you had to take, you cannot help but nod if this means getting as far from here as possible.`
	"CN-14891" `Soon after departing, your ship warns you that a large number of ships are targeting you. It appears the other Ka'sei are also going to attack.`
	"CN-14892" `You disembark from your ship with Dusk, discussing the events that occurred in Patir. "Thank you for keeping the Ka'sei alive, <first>. They might be exactly what our Builder research needs, and I really hope I can continue exploring that place with you in the future. I will study what we have gathered in the last days trying to find anything that could give us more clues about them." He waves at you and starts walking towards the exit from the spaceport. "I will contact you again when I find something worth looking at. May the Embers burn bright for you, <first>."`
	"CN-14893" `You disembark from your ship with Dusk, who is visible angry that you destroyed one of the Ka'sei. "I told you not to attack them! I told you of their importance!" he signs harshly while pacing back and forth. "Oh my, oh my, we can only hope that this does not close any doors for us. Perhaps we can attempt to communicate with them? Tell them it was an accident?" He looks to you as if searching for some reassurance, but you have none to give. "Forget it. I will study what we have gathered, but I am afraid that it will be all that we will ever gather from that system." Dusk storms off without saying goodbye, typing away on his touchpad as he goes.`
	"CN-14894" `It doesn't take long for you to be noticed in the crowded, yet quiet, starport of <origin>. You feel a tap on your shoulder and turn around to see Dusk, accompanied by a group of four. "Good to see you here again, <first>! Do you remember our exploration of the Patir black hole?"`
	"CN-14895" `	One of the other Remnant shows you a hologram of the system, with what looks like the Builder settlement you visited earlier highlighted by a yellow glow. "After studying the data we gathered during our last visit, we may have devised a way to enter the structure undisturbed! Based on our recordings, the Fetri'sei that attacked us in the structure was gathering materials from the asteroid belt with its fellow Ka'sei, and only moved inside the dome when it spotted us."`
	"CN-14896" `	One of the other Remnant shows you a hologram of the system, with what looks like the Builder settlement you visited earlier highlighted by a yellow light. "First of all, we have transferred <payment> to your logistics account for saving the data on the dome's atmosphere. It is only thanks to you that we were able to learn more about what kind of atmosphere the Builders may have lived in."`
	"CN-14897" `	"Can you tell me more about that?"`
	"CN-14898" `	"The air in the settlement we visited was almost evenly split between oxygen and argon, while containing very little nitrogen. Despite its differences, it is interesting to note that such a composition is breathable by human standards."`
	"CN-14899" `	"We could have removed our helmets after the airlock?" you ask.`
	"CN-14900" `	"It is a bit more complicated than that. We found that the pressure inside the complex was much, much lower than what we are used to - less than a sixteenth of an atmosphere. On most Earth-like planets, you would only find such pressures at over 20,000 meters. There are two possibilities: either the Builders were born in a thin atmosphere, or the life support system failed some time ago and the structure has been slowly losing air ever since. We hope to find the answer soon enough.`
	"CN-14901" `	"On top of that, we have learned that the Fetri'sei that attacked us was not waiting in the structure when we first entered the system; it was gathering materials from the asteroid belt together with the rest of its fellow Ka'sei, and only moved inside the dome when it spotted us."`
	"CN-14902" `	"What are you suggesting?"`
	"CN-14903" `	"And?"`
	"CN-14904" `	"Cloaking is the key. If we can stay hidden as we enter Patir and land, then the Fetri'sei should stay outside of the settlement, letting us explore further. Make sure your ship has enough fuel for the journey, however; if you drop your cloak at any time in Patir, then the Ka'sei will block our progress again."`
	"CN-14905" `	After he finishes signing, he makes a few quick gestures toward the projector, enlarging the hologram of the Builder settlement and revealing what looks like a flight path. "You are going to land roughly where we did last time, carrying me and four other xenoarcheologists. If you accept, I should be able to allocate 100,000 credits to help you buy the necessary equipment for this mission."`
	"CN-14906" `	"What if they detect us while inside the structure?"`
	"CN-14907" `	"Sorry, but I don't think it is a good idea to return there."`
	"CN-14908" `	"It is a possibility, yes. It is also quite problematic because communication between the inside and the outside of the structure is impossible. I think the best course of action would be to place a scanner that keeps an eye on the large airlocks on the upper side of the dome, the ones the Ka'sei used last time. If I am right, it should give us around a quarter of an hour to get back in the airlock and escape."`
	"CN-14909" `	"Alright, let's do it."`
	"CN-14910" `You have approached the Builder Settlement uncloaked, making the Ka'sei follow you, or the escort that was carrying the Remnant scientists has been destroyed, or the escort that was carrying the mission cargo was destroyed. You have failed this mission.`
	"CN-14911" `As you slowly descend toward the surface of the planetoid, most of the Fetri'sei continue to orbit Patir, going in and out of the asteroid belt to mine precious metals from it. The few around the planetoid travel not towards the ruins of the Builder settlement, but rather to the massive stockpile of iridium situated nearby. After a final pass around the dome to ensure none of them have begun following you, you land near the imprint your spaceship left in the dusty regolith the last time you came here.`
	"CN-14912" `	"Great work, Captain. We are ready to start our mission." Dusk and his team are carrying with them a set of instruments similar to the first time you were here, from compact laser scanners to a pair of large crowbars. On the crew's backs are cylinders of varying dimensions, with the largest being almost a meter wide. You follow them through the ship's airlock onto the surface and begin the walk towards the complex. Halfway to the dome, Dusk speaks over the radio. "<first>, before we arrive there, do you have any further questions on the mission plan?"`
	"CN-14913" `	"What should I do once we are inside?"`
	"CN-14914" `	"What are you and your team going to do in the complex?"`
	"CN-14915" `	"Do you think the Ka'sei are going to leave us alone the entire time?"`
	"CN-14916" `	"Don't worry, I'll figure it out."`
	"CN-14917" `	"Well, I really hope so!" Dusk replies, grinning behind the glass of his helmet.`
	"CN-14918" `	"Well, that is up to you. From the brief scans I made of the structure it does not seem to have particularly thick internal walls, so communication between us within the dome should be feasible. You could come with me inside the structure to help identify what we find, or if you prefer you could also remain near the airlocks and keep an eye out for incoming Fetri'sei. As I said, the choice is yours."`
	"CN-14919" `	"It depends. Here, look," he says, passing you a data pad with a rather blurry picture. "It is a still image taken from the recording of our encounter with the Fetri'sei. The strong lights ruined most of the video, so we will to have to settle for this picture, but look at the background: do you see that curved board on the left? The quality of the video is too low to be sure, but I think it could be a map of the complex. If I am right, we could split into groups and cover more ground in the few hours we are going to spend here."`
	"CN-14920" `	"Honestly? At this point, I am positive they will. The last time we came here, they had already found us and were probably starting to enter the dome. Right now, they are still in the asteroid belt continuing their mission. There's the possibility that the airlock will alert them of our arrival, but at this point it is unlikely. In either case, I will be sure to keep an eye on the airlock once we are inside the dome."`
	"CN-14921" `	It doesn't take long to reach the airlock ring in front of the dome. The airlock you used last time is still open, and its control panel is visible next to it. Dusk, following your gaze, quickly stops you. "I doubt it would be a good idea to pass through the same airlock we used last time, <first>," he says. "It looks like the structure's automated systems patched up the hole left by the Ka'sei, but I would never trust it as a pressure vessel at this point. Plus, I count at least six more airlocks we could use."`
	"CN-14922" `	He and another member of the group move to the opposite side of the control station next to the airlock, then flip one of the switches on the panel. Just like last time, a door opens next to them, revealing another on the opposite side of the small room. There is space only for three crew members at a time; you, Dusk, and another Remnant enter the airlock, while the other three wait their turn. The door closes, and Dusk flips the switch to begin the pressurization procedure. Suddenly, the lights inside the module turn on, emitting a bright, azure light.`
	"CN-14923" `	"Did you do that?"`
	"CN-14924" `	"What happened?"`
	"CN-14925" `	"I am not sure. Wait." Moving to the opposite side of the airlock, he uses a crowbar to open another hidden control station, which slides out of the wall to reveal a rather large screen scrolling through some alien writing. After reading through it with some difficulty, Dusk breathes a sigh of relief and pulls it back to its original location. "I think it is nothing," he adds, "at least I hope so. From what I could gather, the lights being switched on were a normal, timed event in the commanded startup sequence - why they did not turn on last time is beyond me, but nothing seems to be out of the ordinary. Perhaps they were just broken."`
	"CN-14926" `	A few minutes later, pressurization finishes, and the interior door opens. You follow Dusk out of the airlock and find yourself in front of a large area, likely the same place the encounter with the Fetri'sei took place. "The moment of truth," exclaims Dusk, placing down a heavy scanner, similar to a short telescope. "This is a low-power laser system, capable of measuring the density of the atmosphere anywhere within 10 kilometers. If a Fetri'sei was alerted when we crossed the airlock, by now the large airlock will be filling up with oxygen and argon to allow it to pass through, and this sensor here will register it. Let's see." A tense silence ensues as the machine boots up.`
	"CN-14927" `	"What does it say?"`
	"CN-14928" `	"What are the readings?"`
	"CN-14929" `	Dusk smiles. "The airlock is still empty. It looks like we can finally begin exploring the facility." When the rest of the group finishes crossing the airlock, you all start moving toward a curved board, placed equidistant from each of the entrances. After scrutinizing the writings on it for a few seconds, one of the Remnant exclaims, "A map!" Dusk starts discussing something with the rest of his team, but from your position you can't see what they're signing.`
	"CN-14930" `	(Wait for them to finish their discussion.)`
	"CN-14931" `	(Move closer to try to follow the conversation.)`
	"CN-14932" `	(Try to get Dusk's attention.)`
	"CN-14933" `	Dusk turns around to you. "So, <first>," he asks, "what do you think? This is indeed a map of the Builder complex. The team and I have split the exploration in four groups - one going to the armory, one visiting the underground facilities and another visiting someplace that roughly translates to 'part cycler.' If you want to come with me, we can choose between the general storage area and what seem to be some kind of elevated gardens. Or you could remain here to keep an eye on the laser scanner if you wish; the choice is yours."`
	"CN-14934" `	"Let's go to the storage."`
	"CN-14935" `	"I think it is best to visit the elevated gardens."`
	"CN-14936" `	"Sorry, but the Ka'sei are too much of a danger. I will stay here."`
	"CN-14937" `	"Alright." Dusk and the rest of the team split toward different buildings in the complex, disappearing behind large armored doors. The next hours pass slowly as you stand outside the complex, surrounded by complete silence interrupted only by short updates from those exploring the buildings. Almost four hours later, while checking the atmospheric density scanner yet again, you notice a blinking yellow light, placed near the bottom of the control panel.`
	"CN-14938" `	(Call Dusk with the radio.)`
	"CN-14939" `	As the time passes, the light dims and blinks slower. It takes almost half an hour, but the yellow light finally turns off entirely.`
	"CN-14940" `	Some time later the group returns, satisfied with what they've found inside. "It was an interesting trip for sure, Captain," Dusk tells you. "Did anything of note happen out here?"`
	"CN-14941" `	(Tell him about the light.)`
	"CN-14942" `	"Not much. It was a bit boring."`
	"CN-14943" `	"I imagine so. You would have been more helpful in the complex together with me." After picking up the scanners, you begin to pass through the airlocks, three people at a time. After a few minutes, you're all back outside the dome, ready to finally return to <planet>.`
	"CN-14944" `	As you tell him about the blinking light, he interrupts you and announces to the rest of the group that they are leaving. "The yellow light is an indicator that the battery is running out," he explains hurriedly. "I should have checked our equipment better. Soon, the starship airlock will be unwatched." Instead of going through a single airlock, the group splits, half going into one airlock and half into another. When you're finally all outside of the dome, the tense mood dissipates.`
	"CN-14945" `	As you tell him about the blinking light, his expression changes. "You should have called me! We could have died!" He moves to the console on the laser scanner, which stays dark. "The yellow light was an indicator that the battery was running out," he says. "I should have checked our equipment better. The starship airlock may have remained unwatched for hours now. We need to leave." Instead of going through a single airlock, the group splits, half going into one airlock and half into another. When you're finally all outside of the dome, the tense mood dissipates.`
	"CN-14946" `	While walking back to the ship, Dusk continues talking about the mission. He explains that they found that the Patir settlement had never been visited in its history - not even by the Builders themselves. "I did not expect to find a thriving colony inside, but this is perplexing. A possible theory is that the settlement was built by the Ka'sei themselves, but the variety of designs inside and the way everything was assembled contradicts everything we know about their capabilities. Perhaps the buildings were transported here together with them - or perhaps even the entire asteroid was brought here from a Graveyard system, though that seems unlikely. There is a lot we still have to learn about Patir."`
	"CN-14947" `	Once you're back inside the <ship>, the team moves to their rooms to continue discussing theories about the Builder settlement here. Next destination: <planet>.`
	"CN-14948" `	Dusk takes the lead, and you reach a large building on the opposite side of the dome. The towering cubical structure has multiple doors on the sides, each of them taller than the one before; its walls are light, of a pale blue, with gold and brown finishes around the signs scattered across the area. Dusk stops in front of one of the smallest doors, only a few centimeters taller than you, and starts pushing it to the side to make it slide. Slowly but surely, it starts to move. Dusk enters first, and you follow.`
	"CN-14949" `	If the depot seemed large from the outside, it's even more impressive seen from the inside; massive, sturdy shelves tower left and right, surrounded by odd machinery and cylindrical containers. While you're still studying the structure, Dusk calls you over. "Look here, <first>," he says, indicating the lower shelves in front of him. "What do you see?" It isn't easy to inspect the shelves with just your helmet lights, but you notice they're all empty. "This is not what I would expect from a settlement that used to be inhabited."`
	"CN-14950" `	"What do you think happened here?"`
	"CN-14951" `	"Maybe the rest of the depot will have something."`
	"CN-14952" `	"Is it possible that they just emptied the storage when they left?"`
	"CN-14953" `	"Maybe. But look at how pristine this place is. There is no dirt or dust anywhere I can see, and everything seems to be exactly where it should. It seems more as if it was never inhabited in the first place. There are far too many unknowns about Patir and this settlement to be certain of anything, though." He pulls another instrument from a waist pouch, then begins gathering samples from around the depot, both from the ground and on the shelves. The procedure takes a few minutes; he then puts the samples in one of the cylinders on his back and starts moving to the next room, signing for you to follow him.`
	"CN-14954" `	"At first I thought they abandoned this place and took everything with them, but look: there is no dirt or dust anywhere I can see, and everything seems to be exactly where it should. It seems more as if it was never inhabited in the first place. There are far too many unknowns about Patir and this settlement to be certain of anything, though." He pulls another instrument from a waist pouch, then begins gathering samples from around the depot, both from the ground and on the shelves. The procedure takes a few minutes; he then puts them in one of the cylinders on his back and starts moving to the next room, signing for you to follow him.`
	"CN-14955" `	"Maybe, but I would not get my hopes up if I were you." Sitting down, Dusk takes out of his waist pouch a slim, organic-looking instrument, connected with a cable to a larger box still inside the bag. He takes samples from everywhere in the room: the shelves, the door, the walls, even some from the floor. After enclosing everything inside cylindrical containers, he tells you to get ready to move to another compartment.`
	"CN-14956" `	You follow Dusk around the building, but the results are the same. The depot is full of empty, untouched containers and barren racks in an incredible state of preservation. After Dusk gathers the last samples, you follow him outside, where you join the other teams leaving the building with their samples. Next stop: <planet>.`
	"CN-14957" `	"I agree, it feels the more interesting of the two." The two of you follow the route indicated on the map for a while before reaching the entrance: a slender, sturdy-looking pillar roughly two meters wide with a circular opening on one side. Moving closer you can see the end of a shallow ramp right beyond the door, swirling upwards inside of the column and likely reaching the top of the dome.`
	"CN-14958" `	"If this is supposed to be the exit of the garden," Dusk says, "I fail to see where the entrance should be. We are going to have to walk up it instead."`
	"CN-14959" `	"I would rather keep searching for the entrance."`
	"CN-14960" `	You and Dusk keep walking around the structure for almost half an hour to no avail; with no other choices left but going up the ramp, you give up and decide to follow it up the pillar. Going through it is simpler than it looked, as the surface of the floor is ribbed in a peculiar way so that gripping onto it becomes rather effortless. Despite this, it takes half an hour to reach the garden, and the roof of the dome still lies well above.`
	"CN-14961" `	You follow Dusk up along the ramp, the length of it making the ascent quite tiresome. Luckily, going through it is simple, as the surface of the floor is ribbed in a peculiar way so that gripping onto it becomes rather effortless. Even so, though the garden is nowhere near the top of the dome, it takes another half an hour to reach it.`
	"CN-14962" `	The view at the top is disappointing. In front of you, there are only rows upon rows of long racks with a dry, light gray material on the top and bottom of each shelf. Interspersed between the rows there is some Builder equipment, in which you only recognize large unlit lamps connected to the rest of the structure. Despite all of this, there are no plants anywhere, as far as the eye can see. "I believe we have stumbled upon some kind of hydroponics facility," Dusk says. "I think I have mistranslated the label on the map; this is more like a field than a simple garden."`
	"CN-14963" `	"What is the plan now?"`
	"CN-14964" `	"Why are there no plants growing?"`
	"CN-14965" `	"It has probably been around a hundred thousand years since the last time a sapient being was anywhere near this structure. If we were on an Earth-like planet, the plants would have completely covered any artificial structure, but here on an asteroid in the middle of nowhere? Whatever water supply this place had likely ran out when the Builders were still alive." After stopping to think for a few seconds, Dusk continues.`
	"CN-14966" `	"Even if there are no plants, there must be containers with seeds and fertilizers somewhere around here. We have already wasted a lot of time coming up here; if you go look for those while I gather samples from the abandoned hydroponics, we will cover more terrain in the time we have left." As Dusk begins to prepare the sampling vials and the rest of the equipment, you walk toward the back of the "fields." You enter a series of tall rooms parallel to the hydroponics, none of which contain anything of note - all except the last room, which contains numerous hexagonal containers stacked on top of each other.`
	"CN-14967" `	(Call Dusk.)`
	"CN-14968" `	(Open one of the boxes.)`
	"CN-14969" `	You take one of the boxes from the top of the stack. It seems very heavy for its size, but with the help of the almost negligible gravity of the asteroid, you eventually succeed in taking it down to the floor. Opening it is even harder, as the box seems to have been sealed shut hermetically. After a lot of struggle, it opens to reveal a mass of spherical, light blue seeds tightly packed together.`
	"CN-14970" `	Dusk reaches you shortly thereafter, but he doesn't seem too happy. "I have few pressurized containers with me, <first>. We cannot expose the seeds to the vacuum of space without the risk of killing them, and we are going to need as many chances as possible to make something grow." Taking another box from the stack, he continues, "We ought to leave this one here for a future expedition and grab another one instead."`
	"CN-14971" `	It doesn't take long for Dusk to reach you. "Great find, <first>." After glancing at boxes on various piles, he finally settles for one on the top of a nearby stack and brings it down. "From the labels on its back, it seems to contain three different kinds of seeds."`
	"CN-14972" `	As you awkwardly scoot down the slide with the seeds, the same corrugated texture that made it possible to climb now working against you, Dusk continues his explanation. "It seems odd how none of the boxes you found were empty, or even unsealed. The hydroponics fields were in a similar situation; you would expect to find at least traces indicating the place used to be full of plants, but there was nothing of that sort. I am starting to believe this place was never inhabited in the first place, but assembling this facility would go far beyond the known capabilities of the Ka'sei."`
	"CN-14973" `	Shortly after reaching the end, you meet up with the rest of the team, who all describe situations similar to the one you found. It takes a while to reach your ship outside the dome, but finally everything is ready to return to Remnant space. Next stop: <planet>.`
	"CN-14974" `After disembarking from the <ship>, you help the Remnant carry out what they found in the Builder settlement. The other teams gathered a lot of artifacts during the trip, from oddly shaped vials to tall pieces of alien machinery; you help Dusk carry a small crate, containing a dozen or so cylindrical objects roughly as large as your hand behind a transparent lid. "Thank you for your help, Captain."`
	"CN-14975" `	"What is the next move?"`
	"CN-14976" `	"What is in that crate?"`
	"CN-14977" `	"Oh, these? They are a Builder sidearm - a weapon capable of emitting short-ranged electrical bursts strong enough to incapacitate or kill your target. We discovered a few hundred of them inside some bunkers in the Graveyard long ago. If you would like, I would not mind misplacing one, as a token of thanks for all your help here."`
	"CN-14978" `	"Thank you. How do I use it?"`
	"CN-14979" `	"I'd rather be paid in credits instead."`
	"CN-14980" `	"Oh, I have already transferred 50,000 credits to your account. I need to organize some things for our next mission; if you meet me in the spaceport a few hours from now, I should have everything ready."`
	"CN-14981" `	Dusk quickly explains how to use the Ka'het weapon; its short cylindrical shape is evidently not made for human hands and proves to be quite hard to use, but you eventually figure out how to hold it while still being able to readily press the trigger. While they may not be the best weapon to capture an enemy ship, they're surely going to be very handy from a defensive position inside your own.`
	"CN-14982" `	"Now that we know how to safely access the site, I am going to need to organize our next mission. If you meet me in the spaceport a few hours from now I should have everything ready. In the meanwhile, make sure to prepare a large enough freighter for takeoff - chances are we will need at least a hundred tons of free space in the cargo hold for the complete payload."`
	"CN-14983" `It doesn't take long for you to see Dusk; he's waiting for you under a canopy next to your landing pad, right at the edge of Aventine's starport. "We are almost ready to go," he says, "but I have run into a problem. My plan for our next mission was to have a repeat of the last expedition, but this time carrying a temporary laboratory to the Builder site. I was able to gather most of the instruments I was looking for in the local scientific facilities, but none of the mobile laboratories I am authorized to requisition by default were in good enough condition to fly.`
	"CN-14984" `	"Because of that, before we can start our mission, we will need to make a stopover at <destination> - I was able to convince the prefects on Viminal to reallocate one of the outposts that they had just delivered there to our mission, given it has higher priority than the mining expeditions they are setting up. After outfitting it with our research equipment, it has reached a mass of 97 tons."`
	"CN-14985" `	You help Dusk transport the chosen instruments to your ship; you also make sure to leave enough space for the facilities you're going to take from <planet>. As you're walking back to the ship's controls, Dusk reminds you to bring as many ramscoops with you as possible - you're going to need them in order to complete the mission plan while cloaked.`
	"CN-14986" `Dusk's coordinates indicate the border of a large canyon near the equator of <planet>. Unlike most cracks on the surface, this one shows signs of geological activity: you only narrowly avoid a stream ejecting from a geyser in the canyon as you pass overhead. As you land, a row of Remnant structures are clearly visible running parallel to the cliff.`
	"CN-14987" `	The local crew assist in loading the modular laboratory split across three pallets; with them arrives a separate package, containing a surveillance satellite to be deployed near Patir while cloaked.`
	"CN-14988" `The probe slowly moves away from your ship, opening its external panels and the instrumentation; as you watch it turn into a dim point of light, the Remnant team confirms that it is functioning correctly. Time to land on the asteroid.`
	"CN-14989" `Approaching the settlement from the northeast, you park the <ship> once again next to the airlock array; it's almost starting to become a familiar sight by now. With the cargo ramp pointed toward the entrance and the post-flight checklist completed, the Remnant team begins to deploy the lab while you remain in the cockpit, keeping an eye on Ka'sei activity. The researchers work quickly and nearly without issue in the light gravity of the asteroid, besides the occasional lost screw. However, the construction job still takes nearly the entire day.`
	"CN-14990" `	With the Ka'sei still oblivious, and the lab set up, you take advantage of the opportunity to stretch your legs and pay a visit to the researchers in the new outpost. "So, Captain," asks Dusk, meeting you at the entrance, "what do you think of it?"`
	"CN-14991" `	"It is beautiful."`
	"CN-14992" `	"Well, it seems rather functional."`
	"CN-14993" `	"That is all?"`
	"CN-14994" `	"Admittedly, the research-focused part in it is rather limited - it is a repurposed mining hub, after all - but it should comfortably house a few people for as long as needed. Besides," he adds, "there is all the space you could ask for to stretch your legs inside the dome."`
	"CN-14995" `	"Hopefully! It is a repurposed mining hub, after all, so its capabilities will be quite limited as a laboratory, but it should comfortably house a few people for as long as needed. Besides," he adds, "there is all the space you could ask for to stretch your legs inside the dome."`
	"CN-14996" `	He smiles. "It has a certain charm for sure. As a repurposed mining hub, its capabilities will be quite limited for a laboratory, but it should comfortably house a few people for as long as needed. Besides," he adds, "there is all the space you could ask for to stretch your legs inside the dome."`
	"CN-14997" `	You step inside the lab's internal door, removing your helmet now that the atmosphere is breathable. Dusk takes you around the cylindrical hub to show the various sections of it: the sleeping quarters, small but not cramped; the extravehicular research module, a flexible corridor connecting it with the airlock and housing spacesuits with rather unwieldy instruments, and so on. As the tour comes to an end, you and Dusk return to the entrance, where the rest of the team is split between checking the expedition's equipment and preparing something to eat. "We are about to dine now," Dusk mentions. "There is an extra seat in case you would like to join us."`
	"CN-14998" `	"I would be happy to."`
	"CN-14999" `	"What comes next?"`
	"CN-15000" `	"If that is all, I'd rather move back to my ship to prepare for liftoff."`
	"CN-15001" `	"Alright, Captain," Dusk replies. "I will contact you when we need a ride back. Our current plan is to remain at the outpost for one or two months, exploring the Builder settlement and studying everything it has to offer. Do not go too far, though - emergencies can always happen, after all."`
	"CN-15002" `	Lacking a true dining room, the meal has been set up on a table between the bunks of the researchers. It takes a few tries to find a position in which everyone is at least somewhat comfortable and the dinner can finally begin. You notice that the portions of the rather unappealing Remnant food are much smaller than what you're used to seeing them eat - similar to yours, in fact. One of the researchers notices you looking at her plate, and replies, "I assume you have been told about the symbionts and their increased nutritional needs by now? The four of us have been selected for the mission in part because of the fact that we are part of the small number of scientists that do not wear one, which makes us better suited for expeditions with limited supplies."`
	"CN-15003" `	"What is your reason for not having a symbiont?"`
	"CN-15004" `	"Do you have a symbiont, Dusk?"`
	"CN-15005" `	(Just finish the dinner and leave.)`
	"CN-15006" `	The rest of the dinner passes rather quickly, and within half an hour you're ready to return to your ship. At the entrance, Dusk approaches you.`
	"CN-15007" `	"I do have one - right under the cervical vertebrae, at the top of my back. Being the lead researcher of this mission, there was not much choice left; removing it at this point wasn't an acceptable option, and switching positions this late into the program would have been much more harmful than increasing the reserves planned to the right level." As the dinner comes to an end, you and Dusk move back near the entrance.`
	"CN-15008" `	"For me, the reason is medical. My body rejected the symbiont quite violently shortly after the initial operation, to the point that even attempting to install another would be very risky. But if you ask around, the causes are quite varied." As the dinner comes to an end, you and Dusk move back near the entrance.`
	"CN-15009" `	"Our current plan is to remain at the outpost for one or two months, exploring the Builder settlement and studying everything it has to offer. Do not go too far in the meanwhile, though - emergencies can always happen, and you are supposed to be our ride back when the time comes." He pauses for a few seconds to think. "If you are interested, perhaps you could remain here with us to help with the research. You would need to sleep in your starship, of course, and the supplies would be slightly more limited, but neither issue is a showstopper. It is up to you, <first>."`
	"CN-15010" `	(Accept the offer.)`
	"CN-15011" `	(Decline the offer.)`
	"CN-15012" `	"Perfect then," Dusk replies. "See you tomorrow!" You move back aboard your ship and walk up to the bunks to prepare for the night; however, you notice out of a window that the full Remnant team has come out of the lab, staring up at the sky. You attempt to contact them, but the only result is an eerie quiet. All of a sudden, you realize what is wrong: the starry night is gone, and a sky of an overwhelming black now surrounds everything and everyone.`
	"CN-15013" `	"I understand. See you in a few weeks then, Captain, and may the Embers guide you." You move back aboard your ship and walk up to the cockpit to prepare for liftoff; however, you notice out of the corner of your eye that the full Remnant team has donned their spacesuits, and is standing outside the lab. For a split second you think that they've come outside to watch the liftoff, but they aren't looking at your ship; they're staring up, at the sky. You attempt to contact them, but the only result is an eerie quiet. All of a sudden, you realize what is wrong: the starry night is gone, and a sky of an overwhelming black now surrounds everything and everyone.`
	"CN-15014" `	As your eyes adapt to a featureless sky, you notice brief, nearly imperceptible white streaks passing past your field of view in an instant. The lines become more and more visible, almost like stars during a hyperjump, when your attention is captured by a white mass slightly above the horizon. It starts as a tiny dot in the distance, then becomes bigger and bigger, until it covers the entire sky. The extreme light it produces forces you to look away for a second, and when you look back, there are even more streaks in the sky, to the point of making you feel nauseous.`
	"CN-15015" `	You can't tell how much time has passed since the phenomenon began, but it finally starts to show signs that it's coming to an end: the streaks become shorter and last longer in the sky, and the number of stars you can see becomes less and less. You begin noticing more and more details; some streaks seem to end before reaching the horizon, while others follow a curved or even cyclical pattern around Patir. Eventually, the stars come to a standstill, and everything returns to normal.`
	"CN-15016" `	Still dizzy from the experience, you carefully walk back down outside to speak with the Remnant. By the time you've reached them, they seem to have recomposed themselves and have started studying some sort of holographic stellar map.`
	"CN-15017" `	"What was that?"`
	"CN-15018" `	"Is everyone okay?"`
	"CN-15019" `	"We are all shaken by the experience, but we have much bigger problems to think about now," Dusk replies. "Something is not right with the sky."`
	"CN-15020" `	"I wish I knew. And the worst may have yet to come," Dusk replies. "Something is not right with the sky."`
	"CN-15021" `	He points at the projector. "Do you see those two triangular formations near the top of the star map? That is something we called the Ember Prism - a constellation of six stars of similar magnitude, located far from the Wastes and close to each other. While it is not visible from Earth, it should be recognizable from almost every system here, including Patir, but no longer. And that is not all. None of the constellations in this star map can be found anywhere in the sky." He stops for a second, giving a worried look to the rest of the team. "We are no longer in the Ember Wastes."`
	"CN-15022" `	"Where are we then?"`
	"CN-15023" `	"How do we get back?"`
	"CN-15024" `	"Was that a hyperspace jump then?"`
	"CN-15025" `	"I have no idea, <first>. What I can tell you for now is that we need to get a clearer idea of what we have around before deciding the next step, and there is no way to get that from here. You need to explore as far as possible in this new sector, and return once you either find a way out or run out of systems. I promise we will have a plan ready by the time you're back."`
	"CN-15026" `As soon as you enter Chanai, your sensors detect a massive structure of artificial nature, apparently a station of some kind.`
	"CN-15027" `As you enter the system, your sensors lose any trace of the wormhole you passed from. There doesn't seem to be a way to pass through it again from this end.`
	"CN-15028" `Observing the systems you have mapped, Dusk seems disappointed. "There must be a way to reach the other systems. Please look everywhere you can for a passage; there has to be something."`
	"CN-15029" `By the time you land, the Remnant are already discussing their analysis of the data recorded and transmitted by your ship. When they notice you, they abandon their current conversation and move closer to speak with you in person.`
	"CN-15030" `	They listen carefully as you detail your journey: the Ghila ringworld, the one-way wormholes, the Chanai station, and the many oddities in each of these systems. From the questions they ask you, they seem to be particularly interested about the asteroid-looking creatures roaming this sector. By the time you've finished recounting the last events, almost an hour has passed.`
	"CN-15031" `	"Interesting," Dusk signs in response. "It is disappointing to hear that there is not a clear way out, but everything else here is intriguing - perhaps one of them is the key to finding a passage back. Our attempts at communicating with the Ember Waste have been unsuccessful; I fear we will have to be completely on our own this time."`
	"CN-15032" `	"Have you identified anything of note here?"`
	"CN-15033" `	"Do you have a plan?"`
	"CN-15034" `	"Did you find out what this place is?"`
	"CN-15035" `	"Unfortunately, you seem to have learned a lot more than we did staying here in Patir. We do not have enough information to say anything beyond that we are not in the Milky Way anymore. We were able to re-enter the settlement and access the computers that control the structure, but unfortunately a lot of them are malfunctioning or broken. From what we were able to gather, they seem to be entirely unaware of what has happened.`
	"CN-15036" `	"For now, only vague ideas. I was hoping we could determine a clear, identifiable origin of our accidental jump, but we have nothing of that sort for now. While you were away, we were able to re-enter the settlement and access the computers that control the structure, but unfortunately a lot of them are malfunctioning or broken. From what we were able to gather, they seem to be entirely unaware of what has happened.`
	"CN-15037" `	"The time spent inside the lab was more productive. After a few days, one of the creatures you have encountered jumped in - and a few minutes after, every Fetri'sei around us went dormant. They stopped their engines, ceased mining and just drifted without any sign of life. But as soon as the creature left the system, they returned to their normal activities as if nothing happened.`
	"CN-15038" `	"Going forward, we need to determine a list of possible causes for the event that brought us here, and investigate the most likely one. If we dock to the satellite we launched at the beginning of this mission and recover everything it recorded during the encounter, it could help us understand them better than we can from the ground.`
	"CN-15039" `	"Besides that, we have also confirmed you no longer need to cloak when landing here; when you approach the lab with your ship, you are too far away from the settlement for the Ka'sei to understand that you are coming to visit it, as long as we explore the Builder base only when your spaceship isn't landed here. It should save you some fuel, hopefully. Any questions?"`
	"CN-15040" `	"No, I am ready to go."`
	"CN-15041" `	"I think it would be quicker if we went straight to the station."`
	"CN-15042" `	"Maybe, but that might be an unnecessary risk. First things first, <first>; there is no need to rush anything."`
	"CN-15043" `Walking down your ship's stairway, Dusk thanks you again for your help. You hand him a datapad with the information gathered, as well as the equipment he brought with him to pick up the satellite's signal.`
	"CN-15044" `	"I will join the rest of the team to start analysis," he signs in response. "We have a lot of data to examine, and not much time. Meet us in the lab in a few hours."`
	"CN-15045" `Compared to its cleanliness at the start of the mission, the lab is in chaos: pieces of Remnant devices and Builder objects lie all over the floor and tables, leaving only a small footpath to connect the various sections. The team is gathered on the opposite end of the building, discussing the results of the mission with disappointed expressions.`
	"CN-15046" `	"Bad news, Captain," Dusk says, turning to you. "Both our ground scanners and the orbiting satellite recorded the same amount of information about these beings: nothing at all. For the entire duration of the encounter, the only information gathered on them was their position. Something in their construction makes it impossible to infer anything about their internal structure.`
	"CN-15047" `	"If we do not find a way to learn more about them, we have few options left, and all rather dangerous."`
	"CN-15048" `	"Do you have any ideas?"`
	"CN-15049" `	"Well, there's still other places we could visit."`
	"CN-15050" `	"We are evaluating our options. The Ghila ringworld is too large and distant; the risk of an accident overshadows the possibility of discovering anything useful. On the other hand, the station in Chanai is very close to where Patir is now - a couple jumps, both ways.`
	"CN-15051" `	"However, there are downsides. Exploring it would mean exposing ourselves to any device or trap inside the station; our explorations of Builder stations back in the Graveyard have had body counts." Dusk stops for a few seconds, immersed into his thoughts. "For now, boarding the station is too much of a risk."`
	"CN-15052" `	After searching a large bag on the ground, one of the Remnant brings out another holographic projector. She tinkers with it for a bit until it focuses on the neutron star you visited earlier, Lathia. "This is our safest bet at learning more about these creatures," she signs. "According to your data, this system has by far the highest number and diversity of them. If you pass through the system while cloaked and use our sensors, you may be able to obtain enough information without putting yourself at risk."`
	"CN-15053" `	"If those scanners did not work on them here, why would it be different in Lathia?"`
	"CN-15054" `	"What if I run out of fuel?"`
	"CN-15055" `	"What happens if this fails as well?"`
	"CN-15056" `	"That is a distinct possibility," Dusk replies, "but we must investigate every avenue before we resort to risking personnel."`
	"CN-15057" `	"It will only take a few minutes to determine whether our equipment can see through the exterior of these beings," Dusk replies. "I suggest filling your fuel tanks near Patir before leaving."`
	"CN-15058" `	"It is a shot in the dark," Dusk replies. "Being able to scan even just one of these beings would be a great leap forward - perhaps one without external shielding, or damaged in such a way that permits us to analyze them."`
	"CN-15059" `	The Remnant begin to mount and wire all the scanning equipment on the <ship>. After a few hours, you're ready to take off once again.`
	"CN-15060" `A dull hum from below the cockpit signals that the scanners have activated. You take the opportunity to observe the mesmerizing colors of the neutron star, beautiful and terrifying at the same time. After a few minutes, a beeping sound alerts you that the scan is complete, and you can return to <system>.`
	"CN-15061" `The Remnant are already standing outside the lab, waiting for your arrival. Dusk meets you in the cockpit right as you've finished safing your ship.`
	"CN-15062" `	"It does not look promising, <first>. Just as with the satellite, nothing beyond basic orbital information was recorded by the scanners we gave you. Maybe we could understand something about these beings after in-depth analysis, but nothing that could help us in our search.`
	"CN-15063" `	"One of the few discoveries we could make is the existence of a particular asteroid around Lathia - on an order of magnitude larger than the rest of the fleet, but still belonging to the same species. It appears to be completely still, unlike its kin, and does not show any external activity; this might make it fit for a surface expedition, but doing that on what appears to be a living being is nevertheless extremely dangerous.`
	"CN-15064" `	"Still, our options are limited. I have mentioned previously the possibility of exploring the station in Chanai; it would definitely be risky, but it may be something we are unable to avoid if no safer alternative can be found. While you were away, however, part of the team developed a second mission plan. We came to the realization that if these beings can stop the Fetri'sei, there must be some sort of connection between them. If we could somehow intercept this link, it would let us study more than our sensors could, and perhaps even communicate with them."`
	"CN-15065" `	"How do you propose to do that?"`
	"CN-15066" `	"Can you do that from here?"`
	"CN-15067" `	"Unfortunately, that goes far beyond our area of expertise," Dusk replies, "if it is even possible in the first place. It would be more feasible to connect to this signal physically. We know that the Ka'sei will remain dormant for the entire time the being remains in this system. If the <ship> was close enough to a Fetri'sei when the being arrives, we would have around half an hour to access its internal computer and connect to its communication system. However, this exposes us to significant danger if the being leaves the system prematurely, or if accessing the Fetri'sei reactivates it.`
	"CN-15068" `	"In our opinion," Dusk replies, "connecting to it physically seems like the most feasible option we have. We know that the Ka'sei will remain dormant for the entire time the being remains in this system. If the <ship> was close enough to a Fetri'sei when the being arrives, we would have around half an hour to access its internal computer and connect to its communication system. However, this exposes us to significant danger if the being leaves the system prematurely, or if accessing the Fetri'sei reactivates it.`
	"CN-15069" `	"Even still, we believe this approach is safer than exploring Chanai. You have seen what happened the first time we tried to explore Patir; the structures in this part of space are guarded by lethal force. In contrast, if our new plan goes south, we will at least be able to quickly return to the lab. Of course, it may be that neither of these options will help us escape," he adds, somewhat frustrated. "The team is at a standstill, with both options having more cons than pros. The choice is yours, Captain."`
	"CN-15070" `	"Chanai seems to be a better option."`
	"CN-15071" `	"The new plan feels more viable to me."`
	"CN-15072" `	"Which option do you prefer?"`
	"CN-15073" `	"I do not want to influence you in making this choice, <first>. Both options are more dangerous than I am comfortable with, but there is little we can do about that now. It is up to you now."`
	"CN-15074" `	"Alright then. The first step will be deploying some satellites in the nearby systems. To maximize the amount of time we have, we will need preemptive warning on the arrival of these beings. Reusing the sensors we put on your ship and coupling them with the spare parts we have in storage should be enough to assemble a few probes; meet us in the lab in a few hours and we will be ready."`
	"CN-15075" `	"Okay then. Most of the equipment we are going to need is the same equipment we used for Patir, so we will be ready to depart in just half an hour." After helping them pack the last few items, you take off and set the course to the new destination: <system>.`
	"CN-15076" `The gargantuan station still sits far away from you, appearing as just a dot in the distance. A long range scan of the structure reveals enough of it for an initial assessment; after a quick discussion, the Remnant pick out an approach vector for you.`
	"CN-15077" `The external coating of the structure appears pristine and untouched, much like a new spaceship. Orbiting far above a black hole, next to no asteroid moves in an orbit capable of posing a threat to it. Next to you, one of the Remnant researchers points a bulky scanner toward the station; after a few minutes, she indicates a place from which the structure can be accessed.`
	"CN-15078" `	"This is going to be a little different compared to our previous expeditions in Patir, <first>," Dusk remarks while walking toward the ship's airlock. "We cannot even fathom who built this place, let alone understand how to access their systems and control their doors. We will have to use a little more brute force here to move inside the complex." As he says this, he gestures towards the blowtorch-like piece of equipment on his back.`
	"CN-15079" `	With the <ship> stationed about a meter away from the structure, the entire team slowly moves out of the airlock with you. Still tethered to the ship for safety, the Remnant swiftly prepare the boarding equipment for the mission, attaching it to the platform in a matter of minutes. "In order to access this module, we are about to melt through its hull," Dusk announces. "Are you ready?"`
	"CN-15080" `	"Are you sure this is safe?"`
	"CN-15081" `	"As far as we can tell. The module is fully depressurized, and it seems to be completely inert from our scans - there are always uncertainties, of course, but this is the most easily accessible spot we could identify in the little time we had."`
	"CN-15082" `	A bright flash begins the boarding operations; one of the Remnant, handling the same torch you had seen earlier, slowly cuts a roughly circular hole into the module's whipple shield until it comes off handily. Moving the debris away, the process is then soon repeated with the next layer and again with one right after; the strong vibrations it imparts into the rest of the structure give you a clear hint about the power of this device. Eventually, the innermost layer is removed as well, and you follow the rest of the team inside the alien platform.`
	"CN-15083" `	Disconnecting from the tether to move further into the opening, you immediately notice the module seems to have some peculiarities. Despite the microgravity in it, no handrails can be found near you, making movement very difficult; as you search for some inside with your flashlight, however, your attention is caught by something more bizarre: an ominous, featureless blob, hovering midair a few meters away from you.`
	"CN-15084" `	The object's surface, only interrupted by a few cyclical ripples, reflects and eerily distorts everything around the room. A complete silence has fallen over the room, as everyone seems to evaluate the situation. After a few seconds, Dusk and two Remnant start moving toward the phenomenon carrying a device in their hands.`
	"CN-15085" `	(Wait and see what happens.)`
	"CN-15086" `	(Raise my blaster.)`
	"CN-15087" `	Noticing your reaction, Dusk gestures you to stop. "Calm down, Captain," he signs, "a handgun would be of little use in this situation." Keeping an eye on the data the other scientists are gathering, he continues. "We seem to have entered the station from one of the fuel tanks. That sphere over there is made of some kind of propellant, though our instruments have some difficulties determining its exact composition.`
	"CN-15088" `	"Interesting," Dusk states, as if immersed in his thoughts. After checking that the device has started gathering data, he continues. "We seem to have entered the station from one of the fuel tanks. That sphere over there is made of some kind of propellant, though our instruments have some difficulties determining its exact composition. It must have an incredibly low vapor pressure to remain liquid in this near vacuum.`
	"CN-15089" `	"All I can say for certain is that it is not the hyperdrive fuel we use - liquid deuterium would have boiled off long ago. Luckily, we don't need to know what it is; there should be enough space to pass through without touching it." Scouting around the tank for a passage, the team quickly identifies a maintenance hatch, hopefully leading to the crew section, and starts creating another hole to pass through. The whole process is slightly quicker than the first was, but by the time they're done more than a third of the oxygen reserves in your suit are gone.`
	"CN-15090" `	Moving through the opening, you reach a long, cylindrical corridor, just as dark as the room you just came from. Based on the many handles and scaffolding attached to the surfaces around you, you guess this part of the station used to be inhabited. After following the group through the tunnel for a few minutes, you reach an intersection: the corridor splits into two lateral openings, each of them seemingly as small and endless as the one you're in.`
	"CN-15091" `	"We only have a limited amount of time for this expedition, <first>. You have seen us work a few times now; can you explore the two tunnels on your own and reach us when you have completed it?" Dusk asks. "We will remain in radio contact the entire time."`
	"CN-15092" `	"Do you have any information about this section?"`
	"CN-15093" `	"Why are you not going to help explore these tunnels?"`
	"CN-15094" `	"Not much. We only had time for a brief scan during the approach, but based on the volume of these sectors alone, it shouldn't take you more than a couple hours to explore them.`
	"CN-15095" `	"Well, we have our own tunnels to go through," he replies half-seriously. "We have a lot of ground to cover, and only so much air in our suits. The safest way to increase our reach without staying here for weeks is by splitting up, like we did when we first explored the Builder settlement a few weeks ago.`
	"CN-15096" `	"Whenever you reach a new area, take samples and pictures of anything you deem interesting. Never forget to keep an eye on your oxygen: each of us will consume it at slightly different rates, and we should start the trip back as soon as someone has less than a third of a tank left. May the Embers help your search, Captain, and see you soon!"`
	"CN-15097" `	Moving in the zero gravity station is quick and relatively easy; despite its length, it only takes you a few minutes to reach the end of the right tunnel. All you can find, however, is a closed hatch. A few tries at forcing it open only serve to confirm that it is locked shut, and you decide to go back and try the other tunnel. This time, your search turns up results, and you end up in a dark, somewhat cramped room.`
	"CN-15098" `	The room is lavish and dazzling, the walls covered with intricate carvings. It's a striking difference from the gray and slightly coarse material everywhere else in the station, pushing you to gather a few samples to analyze later. To an extent, it reminds you of the Art Deco paintings of ancient humanity. Around the room, alien plants of varying height and shape paint every corner with a reddish hue.`
	"CN-15099" `	(Quickly take a sample and move on with my mission.)`
	"CN-15100" `	(Inspect them closer.)`
	"CN-15101" `	Growing from the vase up to almost the ceiling, the plant you choose to analyze stands at nearly twice your height; despite this, the trunk is only a few millimeters thick, thanks to the lack of gravity aboard the station. Slender, needle-like leaves are spread across the entire stem, contrasting its okra with a red tint.`
	"CN-15102" `	As you try to take a better look at the fronds, the entire trunk breaks in half with minimal pressure. You try to pick up the upper segment before it flies away, but this only splits it into more parts; you decide to observe the resulting pieces from afar instead. To your surprise, the plant is completely hollow, with a large hole inside the stem. You take a few pictures and a couple samples of both the surface and of the vase, then move to the next room.`
	"CN-15103" `	The rest of the zone isn't as interesting. A series of holes in a wall attract your attention, but they prove too narrow to pass through and too long to see the end; similarly, the corridor at the end of the area is slightly smaller than your suit, preventing you from continuing. As you return back to the rest of the group, however, you notice an unusual drawing.`
	"CN-15104" `	The canvas, attached between various carvings, shows a series of points in a line with every color of the rainbow. While the lines are near the bottom of the mural, above them all shines what looks like a red sun, sending rays of light down to each of the colorful dots and surrounding them all in a crimson halo. You pass your glove over its surface, and you notice every part is composed of a different material, smoother and more refined than the walls around it.`
	"CN-15105" `	While the oxygen levels in your suit continue to lower, you follow Dusk's instructions from the radio up and down the maze of tunnels until reaching a large open area where you finally find the Remnant, busy observing a vial of samples. Behind them, you see the start of the giant barrel that composes most of the station's structure.`
	"CN-15106" `	"What is inside the vial?"`
	"CN-15107" `	(Move closer to the barrel.)`
	"CN-15108" `	The sheer size of the frame is rather impressive: as you walk toward it, you estimate it must be at least a kilometer from one side to the opposite. At the very end, an enormous lens is attached to the last ring of the barrel; four holes near its center give it a slight resemblance to a cloth button.`
	"CN-15109" `	"We are most likely in the exhaust chamber of this station's laser system," Dusk says, putting the vial inside a container. "It is impossible to say for certain what its purpose was - hopefully, it was not purely a military system. That being said, we have obtained some info that is far more relevant for our search. Let us get going toward the <ship> first, then I will show you everything we have gathered."`
	"CN-15110" `	"Our ticket back, hopefully," Dusk replies with a half smile. "While everything we have seen is interesting in its own way, there is something in particular that gives me hope about finding a way out. But first, we need to start moving back now - we have spent enough time studying this exhaust chamber, and our oxygen margins are starting to worry me."`
	"CN-15111" `	One at a time, the group enters back into the main tunnel, with Dusk at the rear and you right in front of him. You notice the passage at the end doesn't show any blowtorch marks; it seems that the Remnant found it already open when they arrived here.`
	"CN-15112" `	"While you were exploring that sector, we found a few more tunnels and split up into subgroups to explore each of them. This is how we found the path to the barrel, for instance, as well as many other peculiar areas. And, in one of them," he continues, clumsily passing you a data pad, "this is what we stumbled upon."`
	"CN-15113" `	Looking at the screen, you see a photograph of two Remnant standing in front of a large mural, three times as tall as them and far wider. Despite the picture being rather poorly lit, you recognize it as a two-dimensional starmap, carved into the wall of the station. Near the bottom right, a set of circles and unfamiliar markers surround one of the systems indicated.`
	"CN-15114" `	"Look at the orbital parameters of that system. It is, without a shadow of doubt, indicating Patir. A system they should not be aware of, if it only just arrived here, but it is one they were apparently interested in."`
	"CN-15115" `	"It could be a coincidence."`
	"CN-15116" `	"Perhaps Patir used to stay here before reaching the Milky Way."`
	"CN-15117" `	"For what purpose?"`
	"CN-15118" `	"I would also like to know that. I cannot recognize the language in the text, and deciphering it would be an enormous task - one that would require a vast amount of text to analyze, as well as years of focused effort from the whole community. We must base our decisions only on what we can infer from the graphic itself, which is far from ideal. And then, there is this."`
	"CN-15119" `	"You may be right. I cannot recognize the language in the text, and deciphering it would be an enormous task - one that would require a vast amount of text to analyze, as well as years of focused effort from the whole community. We must base our decisions only on what we can infer from the graphic itself, which is far from ideal. And then, there is this."`
	"CN-15120" `	"Maybe. Without reading the text surrounding it, which is written neither in Builder nor any language I can recognize, we can only analyze what we can infer from the graphic itself - something far from ideal. But if we take it at face value, it could be the first step towards escape from this sector. And then, there is this."`
	"CN-15121" `	Dusk hands you the vial from earlier, which, despite its size, feels rather heavy in your hand. Inside is a grainy dust interspersed with small, violet crystals of various shapes. "We found a similar powder on the ground of a number of rooms inside the station. We have not explored the entire complex, of course, but if the pattern repeats we expect there to be something similar around the entire barrel."`
	"CN-15122" `	The particles suspended in the vial remind you of the regolith surrounding the Builder settlement orbiting Patir, but far less compact. "Attempts to learn the dust's composition have been inconclusive. Perhaps the instruments in the lab will give us better results, but our current tools only returned noise. However, we did notice something potentially interesting: the noise aligned with the scans you took in Lathia a few days ago. Whatever it is, it could be made of the same matter that composes those creatures - I can use the scanners on your ship to confirm it without wasting any time while we depart."`
	"CN-15123" `	You exit the station and enter your ship, and see most of the scientists have already moved their samples inside your cargo hold, with around two dozen containers scattered on the floor. Soon after, you're back inside the cockpit, preparing for liftoff; discussion about the next mission will have to wait until you're in Patir.`
	"CN-15124" `As you accompany the Remnant team back to the lab, they confirm Dusk's theories on the dust. From the way they speak about it, they seem to have reached a consensus on the source of the regolith, though they don't go into details.`
	"CN-15125" `	The module was never particularly inviting, but over the last few weeks, a thin layer of dust coming from outside the asteroid has covered the floor, with just the surfaces needed for the research kept clean. Tiredness plagues the faces of the scientists: they must not have slept much in the past days to keep up with the amount of incoming data, and neither have you. As you try to remember the last time you stepped outside without a suit - at least a month, most likely - your thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of Dusk, carrying on his back the last few samples.`
	"CN-15126" `	"Sounds like this expedition was more productive than the last."`
	"CN-15127" `	"Now that this is done, what are you going for next?"`
	"CN-15128" `	"Oh, definitely! While the data we could gather was not as much as I hoped, we now have a rather clear connection between Patir and Chanai, as well as between the station and those peculiar beings. That, alone, is invaluable for our mission.`
	"CN-15129" `	"During the trip back, we evaluated the options at our disposal. As you may guess, the most obvious one would be to explore further into the station; however, it was not as attractive as previously thought. While it may have been used to influence Patir, it is clear that it now sits silent and powerless, as if missing something that can bring it back to life. We could find more about its design, perhaps, but the chances of using it on our own within a reasonable time scale are low.`
	"CN-15130" `	"We have enough consumables to last for many weeks still; we started rationing as soon as we arrived in this sector, and we are prepared to reduce them further if necessary. Nevertheless, we need to take a more direct approach if we want results. Approaching the species that inhabits this cluster is essential at this point, and doing so as soon as possible would be advisable."`
	"CN-15131" `	"What do you suggest?"`
	"CN-15132" `	"Are you proposing a first contact of some sort?"`
	"CN-15133" `	"Are they behind the Chanai station?"`
	"CN-15134" `	"Maybe, maybe not. The internal design of the station is an odd fit for the asteroids' size and characteristics, but we do know for certain they have been there in the past, and you have seen for yourself how difficult it is to find a way in.`
	"CN-15135" `	"In a way. We have been considering a close approach to one of those beings ever since we first saw them, and your discovery of the planetoid in Lathia opens up the opportunity for a surface expedition - gathering samples, analyzing its reaction, and perhaps yes, if they are intelligent and the conditions are right, a true first contact between our two species could happen.`
	"CN-15136" `	"We have been considering a close approach to one of those beings ever since we first saw them, and your discovery of the planetoid in Lathia opens up the possibility for a surface expedition. Thanks to its size, landing with the <ship> should be possible, and we could even explore the planetoid in our suits if the surface is safe. Perhaps, if these beings are truly intelligent, this could be the first contact between our two species.`
	"CN-15137" `	"Meet us in the lab in a few hours, and we will have everything ready for the trip. With a bit of luck, most of the instruments we used on Chanai will be a good fit for this mission as well."`
	"CN-15138" `You find the team waiting for you in the lab. Next to them are two mechanical crates, roughly the size of a person. Most of the clutter around the room has been cut down considerably; these satellites alone must have used the larger part of their reserves. "Here they are, Captain," Dusk states proudly. "Two autonomous surveillance probes, capable of scanning an entire system without any input and slowly beaming the results back to us. Their capabilities are far from what our main fleet is capable of back home, but, considering our situation, they should be more than enough.`
	"CN-15139" `	"We have settled on their destinations: the stellar black holes of <waypoints>. Once there, they will be far enough to give us appropriate warning, but close enough to only pick up asteroids heading towards Patir. If they do, that will be our signal to depart and intercept them right as they come in."`
	"CN-15140" `	"Is there a specific orbit I should deploy these probes in?"`
	"CN-15141" `	"Oh, there is no need to worry about that. Their scanners are easily powerful enough to cover the whole system. Their power and communication capabilities are far more limited, but for the time we need them to last, this should not be an issue. Bring me to those systems, and I will handle the rest."`
	"CN-15142" `As the satellite leaves your ship, you watch it move further away and unfurl its solar arrays. The probe quickly disappears in the blackness of space.`
	"CN-15143" `Dusk quickly reaches for the console, initiating the satellite deployment procedure you've become accustomed to. It doesn't take long for it to complete, and in a few minutes you're ready to leave the system once again.`
	"CN-15144" `Dusk seems busier than usual as you descend towards the settlement, constantly communicating with the team on the ground while simultaneously checking the incoming telemetry. When you're hovering right above the landing pad, he turns to your console. "Keep the thrusters in standby, Captain," he signs hastily. "We are not here to stay. The satellites are working very well; in fact, the Thepa probe has just detected one of those beings jumping right in our direction. We have only a few hours to return to orbit, or we will waste this opportunity."`
	"CN-15145" `	On the ground, the whole team rushes out of your ship toward the lab, soon returning with their hands full of strange equipment and unwieldy machinery. You quickly prepare your ship's cargo bay for the new payloads and walk down to Dusk so you can help them carry the instruments aboard. "The approaching asteroid is of the small or medium kind, as far as I can tell. Considering your past interactions, or lack thereof, it is unlikely to cause any issue."`
	"CN-15146" `	"What should I do once in orbit?" you ask.`
	"CN-15147" `	"First, we will verify that all identifiable Ka'sei have entered a dormant state after the creature's arrival. Once that is confirmed, you will rendezvous with one of the deactivated Fetri'sei so that we can spacewalk to it. We will handle the rest from there.`
	"CN-15148" `	"Of course, this will be the first time in Remnant history that one of us boards a Ka'sei; after all, it wasn't too long ago we learned of their existence. But we have explored many kinds of Ka'het over the years with varying results, and with that experience I am confident we should be able to complete our mission."`
	"CN-15149" `	"Are you sure this will be safe?"`
	"CN-15150" `	"Let's go then."`
	"CN-15151" `	"Trust me, <first>," Dusk replies, "it will be incredibly risky. None of us would be doing this if we could say for certain there was a better way, but here we are. Help me with this crate now; we are almost ready to go."`
	"CN-15152" `	As the last container is brought inside, the cargo ramp moves back, and the exit door follows suit. Glancing at the scanner telemetry, you realize the alien being has already started to exit hyperspace; with a button press, the engines roar back to life, and the ship starts gaining altitude.`
	"CN-15153" `The giant creature floats a few meters away from your cockpit, silent and motionless, but you know that inside the shell, the slug remains alive and well, ready to kill. Compared to some of the Ka'het back in the Graveyard, this is one of the Builders' smaller creations, but its size is still impressive for what is, in essence, a single organism.`
	"CN-15154" `	Before setting the <flagship> to automatic station-keeping, you move your ship so that the main hatch is as close as possible to the Fetri'sei. The Remnant are already in the airlock donning their extravehicular suits, and you join them shortly after.`
	"CN-15155" `	"When we are inside, there is a high probability we will not be able to communicate," advises Dusk. "Normally, the walls of the armored shell are too thick and dense for our signals to pass through, and the spaces we need to navigate prevent us from using a physical tether. This does not mean we will be unprotected, however. May I see your sidearm?"`
	"CN-15156" `	You draw your weapon out of the holster and hand it to him. After a quick examination, he nods and gives it back before continuing. "Once inside, one of our first operations will be connecting to the downlink of the Fetri's telemetry: it is not protected, in our experience, and it is easy to access. From there, we will be able to monitor the vessel's shields.`
	"CN-15157" `	"Many things could go wrong during this mission: the unknown creature could leave the system early, or maybe we could inadvertently awaken the Ka'sei with our actions. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, no matter how minor, take out this gun, point at an empty spot on the shell, and shoot. Our terminals will let us know even the smallest variation in its shield integrity, and we will run back to safety as soon as this happens."`
	"CN-15158" `	"Will this not anger the Ka'sei?"`
	"CN-15159" `	"What if you cannot access the shield levels?"`
	"CN-15160" `	"Then we will abandon the mission. Without that safety net, it would be too dangerous to continue. However, since they were both created by the Builders, it should be similar enough to the Ka'het design language.`
	"CN-15161" `	"Almost certainly not, given how negligible the damage should be. A sidearm would not make a scratch in its armor, let alone a dent; and even in the small chance it does activate its defenses, you should have enough time to leave the system and let it calm down.`
	"CN-15162" `	"Inside, we will search for the memory banks of the spacecraft. After a quick selection based on the data we can scrape, we will take the few that contain information concerning our research and extract their contents. Understood?"`
	"CN-15163" `	(Nod.)`
	"CN-15164" `	"What about me?"`
	"CN-15165" `	"Given that you need to be able to fire as quick as possible, you cannot return to the cockpit. So, we took the liberty of creating a small terminal here to keep an eye on the situation." He points to a small desk in the cargo bay filled to the brim with Remnant machinery.`
	"CN-15166" `	One by one, the scientists jump from your ship to the Fetri, moving toward a closed, circular hatch in between the two engines. As you watch them start the expedition, you sit down at the makeshift console, monitoring movements in the system as well as any changes to the slug. Though you can't clearly see what they are doing, you distinguish someone inserting a rod inside a small aperture, followed by the hatch opening right after.`
	"CN-15167" `	As the crew moves beyond your line of sight and communications cease, your unease grows steadily. You split your attention between the various screens in front of you and glancing out of the airlock. The clock on your suit's wrist keeps on ticking slowly.`
	"CN-15168" `	Scanning over the monitors for the umpteenth time, you see that heightened energy levels have been detected inside the unknown creature.`
	"CN-15169" `	(Shoot the Fetri'sei with my sidearm.)`
	"CN-15170" `	You take the weapon from the table and shoot the Fetri'sei just as the creature covers itself in rose-tinted sparks. According to Dusk, one shot should be enough to send the message through the impenetrable armor of the spacecraft, but nothing seems to happen after your gun's energy bolt disperses on the surface of the ship.`
	"CN-15171" `	A second later, the creature covers itself in a burst of rose-colored sparks: it's about to jump away! You take the weapon from the table and pull the trigger, releasing a bolt of energy that quickly disperses on the surface of the Fetri'sei. According to Dusk's words, it should be enough to send the message through the impenetrable armor of the spacecraft, but nothing seems to happen after the shot.`
	"CN-15172" `	Second after second passes relentlessly, with no reaction whatsoever from the Fetri'sei or its surroundings. As the unknown creature fades behind a violet cloud and jumps away, you can't help but wonder what to do.`
	"CN-15173" `	(Shoot the Fetri'sei a second time.)`
	"CN-15174" `	(Keep waiting.)`
	"CN-15175" `	(Jump on the Ka'sei to call the Remnant aboard.)`
	"CN-15176" `	There's no time to waste. Without hesitation, you push yourself off the border of the airlock and toward the Fetri'sei. After remaining airborne for a few instants, you land right next to the leftmost engine nacelle, bouncing off its skin. A timely activation of the thrusters on your wrists helps you move back to its surface, however, and by grabbing a long spike attached to its back, you can finally stabilize and move further ahead.`
	"CN-15177" `	White noise starts coming from your communicator; moving your head up, you finally see the Remnant leaping out of the hatch, carrying a dozen faintly glowing cylindrical tubes under their arms. They notice you right when communication returns to normal, and their message arrives loud and clear: "Jump!"`
	"CN-15178" `	You leave the handles and use your feet to give you a good push away from the spacecraft. At the last second, you move to the right to avoid ending up behind one of its thrusters just as they roar to life. The Fetri'sei has awakened, and for an instant you see all of its systems activate at once - the engines, the steering, even the Ravagers.`
	"CN-15179" `	You press the trigger once more, and the projectile again dissolves in the shield protecting the back of the Fetri'sei. For a few seconds still nothing seems to happen, but then, slowly, white noise starts coming from the communicator. Watching the spacecraft, you finally see the Remnant leaping out of the hatch, carrying a dozen faintly glowing cylindrical tubes under their arms.`
	"CN-15180" `	The wait is excruciating, but after a few seconds, you start hearing white noise coming from your headphones. Right as you start recognizing some words, one of the Remnant leaps out of the hatch, followed closely by the other four. Under their arms, you can distinguish a dozen cylindrical tubes, a faint glow surrounding them.`
	"CN-15181" `	A flashing warning appears on the console: the energy readings of the other spacecraft are rising quickly. Right as you try to warn the rest of the group, the Ka'sei comes back to life, and for an instant you see all of its systems returning online at once - the engines, the steering, even the Ravagers.`
	"CN-15182" `	Amidst the chaos, you count that all five of them made it out of the hatch, still carrying some of the cylinders with them. They were able to leave before the spacecraft's thrusters started firing, and they seem to have remained relatively unharmed by the event. The Ka'sei moves further and further away.`
	"CN-15183" `	One at a time, they move back into the airlock, leaving their cargo attached to one of the instruments they carried with them. As you close the door and pressurize the compartment, Dusk approaches you about the mission.`
	"CN-15184" `	"Thank you for that, <first>. We had to cut short the exploration when we saw your message, before we had the chance to retrieve the specific data we were looking for. As a compromise, we decided to take some memory banks - these cylinders - with us, so we could search through the data later. It was dangerous, but it worked.`
	"CN-15185" `	"That said, I suggest returning to the outpost as soon as possible. The Ka'sei we have boarded may start acting erratically after this, or it may even attack us; we have removed part of its brain, after all. Hopefully this mission will not backfire against us."`
	"CN-15186" `	You sit back in the cockpit, starting the engines once again.`
	"CN-15187" `The giant creature stands before you, slowly pulsating in a pale pink halo. The bubbles that interrupt the asteroid-like surface are slightly semitransparent, giving you a brief look at the crystalline structure inside, but your mind soon returns to your time-limited mission, and you decide to move ahead before it's too late.`
	"CN-15188" `The time has come: the walk toward the lab is quick and straightforward, and you cover the whole distance in a matter of minutes. Peeking through the hatch's window, you see the rest of the group preparing their backpacks, with prepacked toolboxes surrounding them in every direction. You wave through the glass, and they return the greeting.`
	"CN-15189" `	You move the airlock's heavy door to pass through, and wait for the room to be re-pressurized before walking in. By the time the hatch unlocks, however, the Remnant are gone, hastily leaving their bags on the floor.`
	"CN-15190" `	As you take a few steps inside the lab, you turn around to find them all glued to the windows with an awestruck gaze. The sky has again turned black, and a few dim lines are already starting to appear in the distance.`
	"CN-15191" `	While stars and galaxies zoom in the night sky, a few of the Remnant run around the lab, turning on various instruments. However, most of them remain with their faces stuck to the glass. The lights start converging toward a single point, forming a large, but rapidly shrinking mass in the background.`
	"CN-15192" `	The stars begin to slow down before settling into their final positions. After all the time you have spent here, it isn't difficult to recognize that the sky has changed again. Next to you, the rest of the team is already analyzing the data gathered; Dusk seems to be writing down something from a chronometer.`
	"CN-15193" `	"Are we back in the Milky Way?"`
	"CN-15194" `	"How long was that?"`
	"CN-15195" `	"Where are we now?"`
	"CN-15196" `	"I cannot say yet," Dusk replies hurriedly. "Quick, put your EVA suit back on. We need to depart as soon as possible, all of us together. I do not know how much time we have." You hastily connect your helmet back to the life support and follow them out of the airlock, trying to keep up as best as you can.`
	"CN-15197" `	"Around four minutes," Dusk replies hurriedly. "But we will talk about that another time. We need to depart as soon as possible, all of us together. I do not know how much time we have." You hastily connect your helmet back to the life support and follow them out of the airlock, trying to keep up as best as you can.`
	"CN-15198" `	It takes only a few minutes to launch the <ship>, the six of you standing in the cockpit with trepidation. "We will take care of the necessary analysis while you bring us to orbit. Hopefully we have been sent to the Milky Way, and not to yet another unreachable galaxy."`
	"CN-15199" `Back down on the surface, you complete the post-landing checklist while keeping an eye on the movements of the Ka'sei. The research station has been a safe place to retreat during past expeditions, but it seems doubtful that it could last against a prolonged attack from one of the Fetri'sei.`
	"CN-15200" `	When the scientists finish unloading their cargo, Dusk calls you with the communicator. Now that the immediate danger is over, a hint of frustration creeps into his voice.`
	"CN-15201" `	"The cells we have taken from the Fetri are only a few out of multiple hundreds. We did our best to choose those that were recorded at times when those beings were present, but we will still need some luck to get the results we wanted.`
	"CN-15202" `	"Our calculators have been crunching numbers for hours now, ever since we cracked open the first canister. By the time you have reached the lab, we should have the analysis ready." You close the hatch behind you to join the rest of the crew.`
	"CN-15203" `	As the asteroid continues its nearly imperceptible spin, Patir emerges from behind the giant dome, allowing its rays to pass through. You take the last steps towards the outpost with the sunshade lowered and walk into the lab once more.`
	"CN-15204" `	The module was never particularly inviting, but over the last few weeks, a thin layer of dust coming from outside the asteroid has covered the floor, with just the surfaces needed for the research kept clean. Tiredness plagues the faces of the scientists: they must not have slept much in the past days to keep up with the amount of incoming data, and neither have you. As you try to remember the last time you stepped outside without a suit - at least a month, most likely - your stream of thoughts is interrupted by the arrival of Dusk, carrying in his hands a ream of papers.`
	"CN-15205" `	"The information in the memory containers is indeed from when one of those beings was in the system, and the data recorded was far more comprehensive than our own scans. However, the memory containers we extracted only contain records from the middle of the phenomenon, without showing how it begun or ended. Additionally, understanding their contents is going to take longer than we hoped for. We knew that the exact relationship between the being and the Fetri'sei would be beyond our knowledge, but we cannot even make preliminary guesses as to how they are able to communicate.`
	"CN-15206" `	"We have enough consumables to last for many weeks still; we started rationing as soon as we arrived in this sector, and we are prepared to reduce them further if necessary. Despite this, the time and manpower needed to crack this code would go far beyond what we could feasibly achieve. We have hit a roadblock that, for now, we cannot overcome."`
	"CN-15207" `	"Does this mean we need to repeat the mission?"`
	"CN-15208" `	"What are our options?"`
	"CN-15209" `	"We considered it briefly, but it would be quite ineffective. Our blocker is understanding the data itself, and having even more would do little to help us with that. On top of that, the risk would be extremely high, as we have seen. All things considered, we are at the same point we were a week ago.`
	"CN-15210" `	"We are left with few alternatives. As I told you previously, the Chanai station is an interesting possibility, and could have influenced Patir's erratic behavior. At the same time, exploring the asteroid around Lathia may put us closer to understanding the inner workings of the beings and how they interact with the Ka'sei. It is quite dangerous, but visiting the space station is also an unknown, and maybe a more direct approach is what we need to accomplish our objective. Neither mission prevails over the other in a definite way, and our votes within the team are split evenly between the two, so if y-"`
	"CN-15211" `	Dusk halts mid phrase, looking behind you with an awestruck gaze. The sky has again turned black, and a few dim lines are already starting to appear in the distance. The whole team jumps to the windows, watching as the light show begins.`
	"CN-15212" `	While stars and galaxies zoom in the night sky, two Remnant keep running around the lab, turning on various instruments. However, the rest of them remain with their faces stuck to the glass with you. The lights start converging toward a single point, forming a large, but rapidly shrinking mass in the background.`
	"CN-15213" `The cockpit has become quite chaotic: the instruments the team brought with them keep buzzing and beeping. After shutting down the main engines, someone taps on your shoulder to call your attention. "<first>, could you pitch the ship down a few degrees?" Dusk asks, with a calmer look than during liftoff. You reply with a nod, and move the stick forward slightly.`
	"CN-15214" `	"There! Do you see it?" he continues, pointing at a spot in the sky with his hand. Between the mass of stars in front of you, a pattern leaps to the eye: two sets of three stars, right next to each other, forming a prism-like structure. "We are back."`
	"CN-15215" `A large crowd quickly gathers around your landing pad, eagerly awaiting your arrival. After all this time between the stars, setting foot on a planet with an actual atmosphere is incredibly refreshing. Ignoring the cold weather for a moment, you take the biggest breath you can to make up for the past weeks of recycled air.`
	"CN-15216" `	Before you've even reached the end of the ramp, the people on the ground are already signing questions to you and the rest of the team about your journey. You do your best to reply, but in the overall mix of confusion and excitement you aren't sure anyone understood what you just said.`
	"CN-15217" `	Between the chaos, you hear a familiar voice singing your name: a few meters on your left, you notice Chilia with his arm raised and a large grin greeting you back. Moving across the crowd not without some difficulty, you follow him through a narrow door inside a cramped room right next to the pad.`
	"CN-15218" `	"I prefer this spaceport when it is more hushed," he remarks with a sigh, "but after the past weeks some frenzy is understandable. We will have to make do with this warehouse for now." He invites you to take a seat. "So, <first>, would you tell me about your journey?"`
	"CN-15219" `	By the time you're done, more than an hour must have passed. Chilia paces aimlessly around the room, reflecting on your recounting of the events. As silence falls, you notice that calm seems to have returned on the pad as well.`
	"CN-15220" `	(Wait for him to speak.)`
	"CN-15221" `	"Do you know how we came back to this galaxy?"`
	"CN-15222" `	"What happened while we were gone?"`
	"CN-15223" `	"Oh. I thought you had been told already." He sits down in front of you. "It was us that brought Patir back here. After your departure, it did not take long for our long-range sensors to pick up that the black hole had disappeared, along with you and the team. Our data was scarce, but we knew one, very important thing: if Patir had appeared here once, there must have been a way to do that again.`
	"CN-15224" `	"If your description is accurate, it means Patir is not another mouth to a pocket universe, but instead a transporter to another galaxy. Or universe, for all we know. In retrospect, there were enough reasons to doubt that first theory, but we were far too busy trying to save you to look into it seriously." Seeing your confused expression, he continues. "<first>, it was us who brought Patir back here.`
	"CN-15225" `	"We knew Postverta was involved with Patir's initial arrival, and together with the team there, we discovered that the energy burst that had been released when Ssil Vida first appeared had no relation to the systems controlling its pocket universe. So, its activation or deactivation would have no effect on Patir, and we had to start looking somewhere else.`
	"CN-15226" `	"Our research up to this point had mostly focused on the pocket universe; most of Postverta is still obscure to us. As we evaluated our options, we determined that, by the time we could understand the station's systems enough to use them for our purposes, your crew would have already run out of supplies and perished. Instead, we attempted to replicate the energy burst using just our technology, augmented by the transmission systems of Ssil Vida.`
	"CN-15227" `	"The project took most of our workforce, as well as several weeks to complete, no thanks to a number of setbacks almost making us start over from scratch. But with the full power of the onboard reactors and an array of calculators rivaling that of our largest outposts, its giant antennae came back to life, and released a wave as strong as when Ssil Vida appeared. Two weeks later, Patir returned, and now you are here, safe and sound."`
	"CN-15228" `	Finally, a tired Dusk reaches the two of you in the storage room, sitting down after greeting Chilia and you. From a brief exchange between them, you infer that he has also been told of the circumstances around your return.`
	"CN-15229" `	"What is going to happen to Patir now?"`
	"CN-15230" `	"Wait, what if we were not around Patir when it came back?"`
	"CN-15231" `	"The black hole would have departed without us, and we would have been still stuck in that sector - only this time without a laboratory to support us, nor most of our consumables. The people down here perhaps could have been able to send Patir back there to pick us up, but by then we would have run out of supplies long before, and perished between the stars. We were lucky that things went the way they did, all things considered. Our research in those systems was supposed to bring us back, and yet we were just chasing rainbows, endangering ourselves further every step we took.`
	"CN-15232" `	"It is difficult to say. Given what we have observed, it will probably disappear once again after the effects of our energy burst; when that will happen or where it will go is beyond our current knowledge. Those same systems we were stuck in could now be inaccessible, and our data might be the only information we will ever gather on them.`
	"CN-15233" `	"At this point in time, exploring Patir would be a gamble, and an extremely risky one at that. The next phase will have to be operated from a distance, in order to fully understand the way that system works and how Ssil Vida controls it. How much time that will take, I cannot say; maybe weeks, or months, or even years. But then, and only then, will we go back there and start digging deeper."`
	"CN-15234" `	"You want to return there?!"`
	"CN-15235" `	Dusk smiles. "It is my job, after all. The danger of the unknown is always a part of it, even in the simplest of missions. I do admit the risk in these past weeks was far beyond an acceptable level, but one day, we will know enough about the mess in which we have become tangled in to unravel it."`
	"CN-15236" `	The two of them accompany you to the <ship>, sitting alone in the now-quiet spaceport of <planet>. The cargo bay has been emptied of the vast array of instruments that had been lying in it for a while, and you guess the same has been done with the cockpit. As you walk once again up the stairway, the Remnant bid you farewell. "We have transferred <payment> as a way to express our gratitude," Dusk signs with a smile. "Of course, their worth is incomparable with the value of what you have done for us; without you, we would have never made it out alive. Goodbye for now, and may the Embers aid in your pursuits."`
	"CN-15237" `You make a close pass above this lifeless satellite, abandoned in a graveyard orbit for who knows how long. All of a sudden, your commlink emits a weak, garbled, whistle-like sound, as if receiving a communication from the Builder spacecraft. While you can't understand it, it might be worth paying another visit to the Remnant.`
	"CN-15238" `A glance at the radar screen reveals that the nearby Builder satellite exploded, presumably due to the damage incurred. A wasted opportunity.`
	"CN-15239" `Do you want to ask the Remnant about the Builder satellite you encountered in Fereti?`
	"CN-15240" `	You spend at least half an hour looking for someone in the spaceport, but you can't seem to find anyone familiar. Just as you're starting to lose hope, you notice a flurry of movement in the direction of one of the scientific laboratories.`
	"CN-15241" `	Moving closer, you notice the crowd moving away to leave space for a convoy of heavy machinery to pass through. Though you can't seem to identify their function, you do recognize the person in front of the camels that head the vehicles: it's Plume, the scientist leading the Void Sprite Research program.`
	"CN-15242" `	You wave your arm to try to catch his attention as you slowly squeeze through the crowd until he notices you. "Captain <first>! I did not expect to see you here. You were part of the fleet as well?" he signs, excitedly gesturing toward the cargo being transported.`
	"CN-15243" `	Seeing your confused expression, he understands his mistake. "I have been spending some long days in the laboratory recently. It is good that we have such an abundance of data, of course, but the preparations for this expedition have been exhausting."`
	"CN-15244" `	"What are you transporting?"`
	"CN-15245" `	"I found something interesting in Fereti."`
	"CN-15246" `	"Cryogenic vats, full of Void Sprite material. All the work done in Esquiline is finally bearing fruits, and this is the more noticeable result. It did not take long after we left them to roam in Pantica that we started to realize that their close passes to the station left visible traces of secretion all over it. All we had to do was place detachable panels over its hull to begin gathering and analyzing those samples.`
	"CN-15247" `	"Of course, most of this machinery is dedicated to keeping the material at the right conditions of pressure, temperature and composition. Each vat contains just a few kilograms of samples at most. Still, it is hard to overstate the impact such a continuous and harmless source of Void Sprite samples could have on genetic research over time.`
	"CN-15248" `	"What about you?"`
	"CN-15249" `	You explain your encounter with the Builder satellite and the signal it sent you to Plume. By the end of your story, however, he still seems quite confused. "I was hoping there would be Void Sprites involved," he jokes, "but it was an interesting story nonetheless.`
	"CN-15250" `	"I am not quite sure how to help you this time, though - none of this is really within my expertise."`
	"CN-15251" `	"Who should I ask then?"`
	"CN-15252" `	"That is a shame."`
	"CN-15253" `	Plume leaves to oversee a group of technicians unloading the contents of the first vehicle, gesturing for you to wait for him. He comes back to you a few minutes later. "I have an idea. Follow me.`
	"CN-15254" `	"Here," he signs after a short walk, gesturing toward a wall-mounted terminal. "I may not have enough engineering experience to help you directly, but if there is a place where that information might be, it is here." He shows you to a data pad, grabbing your hand and passing it below a scanner before continuing.`
	"CN-15255" `	"This pad contains the extracts of all our published engineering papers - the publicly available ones, at least. If what you have encountered has been studied previously, it should be here somewhere." Plume returns to his job after showing you the basics, signing to give him a call if you need more help.`
	"CN-15256" `	Left by yourself, you grab a nearby seat and start making some searches inside the terminal. The first half hour does not return any useful result: there are millions of papers to choose from, and the initial queries you come up with find either thousands of possible matches, or none at all.`
	"CN-15257" `	Eventually, however, you start getting the hang of it. You find one paper that describes the phenomena you observed, then another, then even more. By the end of the hour, you've saved at least a dozen relevant papers.`
	"CN-15258" `	Though you can't understand any of them in depth, a detail catches your eye: three of those papers were authored by Gavriil, the engineer you last left in <system>. If there's anyone who can get you to the end of this, it has to be them.`
	"CN-15259" `	You wave goodbye to Plume, still busy transferring the delicate cargo to the safety of the laboratory, and climb aboard your ship. Next stop: <planet>.`
	"CN-15260" `The more time passes, the more Ssil Vida resembles a Remnant outpost. The local spaceport has followed a transformation similar to Esquiline on a grander scale, with walls covered by mazes of piping and dozens of active work stations expanding the already operational outfitter. There is no need to wander around, however: Gavriil is waiting for you right beside the landing pad.`
	"CN-15261" `	"Nice to see you again," they gestures warmly. "I hope the Embers blessed your journey."`
	"CN-15262" `	"They did."`
	"CN-15263" `	(Tell them about the encounter.)`
	"CN-15264" `	You take them aside to again explain your encounter with the Builder satellite, but they stop you before you can begin. "Plume told me everything a few days ago. It is always delightful to see something one has theorized about become reality," they continue proudly. "What you have observed is usually called a 'zombie satellite.' Not too technical of an expression, maybe, but certainly meaningful.`
	"CN-15265" `	"There are many ways a spacecraft can die, some less violent than others. And there are times, years after the supposed end of operations, when the spacecraft spontaneously comes back to life and communicates again with the ground. It is not a predictable event, nor does it happen only to specific designs; it simply happens, no matter whether the satellite was built on Aventine, Hai-home, or Valhalla.`
	"CN-15266" `	"What makes it special in this case is the sheer length of time that has passed between the 'death' of the satellite and now. This spacecraft was silent the last time we explored Fereti, which either means it survived for tens of thousands of years and died a few hundred years ago, or that it died at the time of the Builders and only came back to life after millennia - both very fascinating possibilities in their own right.`
	"CN-15267" `	"This would be the first active Builder satellite we have identified, which is not surprising given these conditions. If your report is accurate, we need to go study it as soon as possible."`
	"CN-15268" `	"How did it come back to life?"`
	"CN-15269" `	"Can you take a look at the signal it sent?"`
	"CN-15270" `	"I have a few ideas, but there is no way to be sure. One of the most frequent causes is the software successfully rebooting after a memory failure, practically resetting it to the factory setup, but without more information this is at best a guess on my part."`
	"CN-15271" `	You hand them a data chip with the communication you received from the satellite, which they quickly put into their pocket. "I will try to take a few hours off to give it a first pass with the instruments we have here. While they are not the best suited for this sort of analysis, I remember a few tricks that might get something usable out of it.`
	"CN-15272" `	"In the meantime, feel free to take a look at the changes we have been making here. I will give you a call from the spaceport when I have something to show."`
	"CN-15273" `Do you want to ask the Remnant about the communication received from the Builder satellite?`
	"CN-15274" `With the ongoing construction preventing you from reaching most of the station, you try to look around near the landing pad. It takes almost half an hour before you give up; there's too many people to try to find someone who knows you, and everyone else seems far too busy to stop and listen to your story. Perhaps you will have better luck in the spaceport of a major planet.`
	"CN-15275" `Ssil Vida's outfitter was built atop the original storage platforms of the station, far too large for the Remnant's logistics system. While it does not seem to be particularly well equipped, what they were able to set up on completely alien infrastructure since the first time you came here is still impressive.`
	"CN-15276" `	Your walk comes to an end when Gavriil's name appears on your communicator. You turn around and stride back to the spaceport, where you find them waiting at a table.`
	"CN-15277" `	"I have good news and bad news," they sign with a slight frown. "How much do you know about the history of our exploration of the Graveyard?"`
	"CN-15278" `	"Not much. Can you summarize it?"`
	"CN-15279" `	"Enough."`
	"CN-15280" `	"After the loss of a number of vehicles to what we now know to be the Ka'het, our ancestors developed and adopted new standards to reduce the risk of such expeditions into the depth of the Ember Wastes. Cloaks were to be kept active at all times while inside the Graveyard, limiting the range of our archeological missions to the ever-increasing capacity of our fuel tanks.`
	"CN-15281" `	"Despite limiting most expeditions to the northern systems, these guidelines still led to the golden age of Builder archeology, giving us incredible insights into the history of this region and its inhabitants. The culmination of this effort was the partial translation of their written language, as well as the decoding of some of their programming. The problem, however, is that this did not extend to their spoken language.`
	"CN-15282" `	He looks amused. "I will try to keep things short then. During our archeological effort, we were able to translate most of the written Builder language and decode some of their programming. The problem, however, is that this did not extend to their spoken language.`
	"CN-15283" `	"What we have discovered in the analysis is that the communication you received contains some kind of audio recording, the meaning of which remains a mystery. I have transmitted it to Aventine so that xenolinguists will be able to archive it for further study, but the purpose of this signal, and consequently of the satellite, will remain unknown."`
	"CN-15284" `	He pauses for a few seconds, thoughtful. "The data we have gathered shows that the satellite is not too large, nor particularly heavy. A way to circumvent these issues could be to capture the Builder spacecraft and bring it to one of our laboratories - if it is still alive it should be possible to extract its data mostly, if not fully intact.`
	"CN-15285" `	"Have you ever been on <planet>?" they ask, without waiting for an answer. "It is a small semi-abandoned colony in <system>, orbiting right above Viminal. I used to know some people there who should have just the equipment a project like this would need."`
	"CN-15286" `	"Alright, let's do this."`
	"CN-15287" `	"Will you come with me?"`
	"CN-15288" `	You make a gesture toward your ship, to which they reply with an undecided expression. "Our backlog here has been growing considerably, and leaving for another adventure right now would not make it shorter." They stop for a few seconds, then continue.`
	"CN-15289" `	"On the other hand, we have also been completing milestones ahead of schedule lately, and there are plenty of experienced people here who could take over for some time. I can afford to leave the reins to someone else for a few days.`
	"CN-15290" `	"Plus," they conclude with a smile, "it will be an opportunity to see some faces I have not seen in years, and to reminisce about the past for a bit. I should have done this a while ago."`
	"CN-15291" `The gradual descent toward the landing site is quite slow. Dozens of mining outposts are scattered over the surface, some of which are quite big, but none of them give the impression of being in active use. Even the landing pads, almost all empty, have started to show a thin layer of dust and regolith.`
	"CN-15292" `	"Just a few decades ago, these buildings were sprawling with activity," Gavriil explains, keeping their eyes on the horizon. "Everyone was on the hunt for Key Stone veins outside of Viminal, and planetary systems tend to have similar characteristics between each other. I will spare you the details, but this turned out not to be the case with <planet>, and most of the infrastructure that had built up here was left without a clear purpose."`
	"CN-15293" `	Following the landing trajectory, you steer left after passing over a canyon and prepare for the final approach. You notice their eyes light up when the target outpost comes into view, just for an instant. "So as not to leave it to rot, a few projects to reuse the abandoned facilities were given the go ahead. The one we are going to visit today has become a major testing facility for advanced technologies, whether built by us or recovered from other sources."`
	"CN-15294" `	"I see."`
	"CN-15295" `	"Is this testing dangerous?"`
	"CN-15296" `	"Was the Key Stone search successful?"`
	"CN-15297" `	"Not as much as we were hoping. The only other place to turn a positive result was Eavine, a gas giant's moon located right in the middle of Ka'het-controlled space. It was a scientifically interesting finding, but not one that we could make use of in the near future."`
	"CN-15298" `	"It can be. Many weapons have been tested here over the years, and even projects that had more peaceful purposes occasionally had some rather explosive results. Mind you, this is no matter to be taken lightly."`
	"CN-15299" `	By the time you complete the post-landing checklist, Gavriil has already left the ship to meet up with the people on the ground. The crowd that has been gathering around the pad gives them a warm welcome, to which they reply cheerfully. They must have spent a lot of time on this moon when they were younger.`
	"CN-15300" `	After some brief introductions, you follow the group as it moves down a few ramps of stairs and inside some well-lit tunnels right below the outpost. At the end of them lies a large hangar, wide in both directions but with a rather low ceiling. "We have a few rigs we used to capture test satellites in the past," one of the technicians explains. "They were Remnant spacecraft in those cases, but there is nothing fundamentally preventing their use in your mission.`
	"CN-15301" `	"Connecting with the spacecraft after you carry it here is going to be a bit more complicated. We have the machines necessary to keep it stored, but I had to order some special devices from Aventine to download its data after all is said and done. Either way, a fleet will have brought it here before you are back, so it should not pose a problem."`
	"CN-15302" `	You help them load the satellite capture equipment in your ship, and make sure to leave enough space for the spacecraft itself. "I will stay here to help them prepare for the satellite," Gavriil signs, "and hopefully remain updated with Ssil Vida on the progress made in my absence. See you in a month or two."`
	"CN-15303" `You approach the spacecraft, and activate the equipment the Remnant gave you. Slowly, a large robotic claw, padded with a thick gray insulation, emerges out of your cargo hold. It takes a few tries, but you're finally able to put the satellite into your cargo bay and prepare the fittings to keep it in place.`
	"CN-15304" `A few pad workers guide you to the designated landing site, where a large harness is waiting for your special payload to arrive. Once the satellite's container has been safely berthed to its transporter, you follow the convoy as it slowly descends down a wide ramp and into the same hangar you had been shown earlier.`
	"CN-15305" `	Gavriil seems enthusiastic. "Fantastic. We have already prepared the machinery delivered from Aventine, so we should be able to start the transfer right now," they sign, gesturing toward four contraptions - each about as large as a closet. "I hope your journey went well."`
	"CN-15306" `	"About as well as a mission in the middle of the Graveyard can go."`
	"CN-15307" `	"It could have gone better."`
	"CN-15308" `	"I will make sure to reward you appropriately once this is said and done," they reply. Behind them, two technicians climb atop a scaffolding and take a closer look at the satellite you brought with you. "One of the challenges with these kinds of artifacts is not only their alien origins, but also the era in which they were designed.`
	"CN-15309" `	"The Builder empire lasted for tens of millennia; their technological level varied wildly during this time, and the remains of one era are often incompatible with the remains of previous eras. We have done our best to date this spacecraft, so this is the moment of truth."`
	"CN-15310" `	A technician carefully hands a wide cable to the two atop the platform, who move toward the captured satellite and try to insert the cord into an opening on its back.`
	"CN-15311" `	It takes a few attempts, but at last they succeed. While you can't quite see what one technician is signing from the control console, it must be great news, judging from the cheer that erupts soon after. "The transfer has started!" Gavriil gestures in celebration. They rush toward the terminals at the back of the hangar, almost in disbelief.`
	"CN-15312" `	The excitement only slightly wears off as the hours pass, the sheer amount of data taken from the spacecraft boosting it again and again. Finally, Gavriil comes back to you with anticipation. "The transfer is mostly complete by now, and the analysis will soon begin. If you are ready, this would be a good time to return to Ssil Vida - it will take days before any result is ready."`
	"CN-15313" `During the trip, Gavriil has received a constant stream of communications, either from Kumkapi or Ssil Vida. They walk alongside you out of the airlock and down the ramp, silent but clearly thoughtful.`
	"CN-15314" `	"Thank you for this, Captain - not just for ferrying me back, but also for making this little adventure possible in the first place. There is still much to discover about the Builders and their civilization, and I am happy to have contributed to this puzzle at least a tiny bit.`
	"CN-15315" `	"One of the key events in order to understand their history is the first contacts they had with what for them would be alien species. As it often happens, the first one was with the peaceful Quarg, but there is at least another encounter we know of that did not go nearly as well.`
	"CN-15316" `	"We do not know whether it was an actual invasion attempt or just an explorer that did not react well under pressure, but the two species fought, and the Builders only won after multiple days of fighting. The militarization of Builder society started at the same time."`
	"CN-15317" `	"What species were they attacked by?" you ask.`
	"CN-15318" `	"We cannot say for certain. From what I understand, no alien remains were found during the past Graveyard expeditions - other than Builder ones, naturally. However, an interstellar species does not just disappear without leaving any trace, and there are only a small number of candidates who fit the bill."`
	"CN-15319" `	"The Korath?"`
	"CN-15320" `	"The Hai?"`
	"CN-15321" `	"The Pug?"`
	"CN-15322" `	"The Sheragi?"`
	"CN-15323" `	"A good guess. Both the Hai and the Sheragi would make sense - the timeline fits well enough, they were known to be quite belligerent, and their potential reach was large enough to include the Graveyard. I heard there are great debates about the two species going on to this day, especially after the discoveries in Ssil Vida, but I am not the person to ask about them.`
	"CN-15324" `	"Interesting guess. We do know that they used to have a presence in this area at some point, but there is no use in speculating about their purposes with so little information, especially when there are more likely candidates. Either the Hai or the Sheragi would make more sense - the timeline fits well enough, they were known to be quite belligerent, and their potential reach was large enough to include the Graveyard.`
	"CN-15325" `	"Not this time," they sign, amused. "More time has passed between the end of the Builders and the Korath's discovery of spaceflight than it has between the latter and now. Keep it in mind that we are talking about something that happened perhaps a hundred thousand years ago. In this context, either the Hai or the Sheragi would make more sense - the timeline fits well enough, they were known to be quite belligerent, and their potential reach was large enough to include the Graveyard.`
	"CN-15326" `	"Whatever happened, the scars left by this short encounter were not merely psychological. What this satellite shows is that some kind of virus or bacteria started spreading soon after the first contact, possibly of alien origin. We do not know the impact it had on their civilization, but it must have been quite severe: Alix appears to have been used as a quarantine facility at the time, and satellites like this had the sole function of warning incoming ships of the danger.`
	"CN-15327" `	"If you find anything else, do not hesitate to tell us. The analysis is still ongoing, but I have been able to spare 300,000 credits to deposit on your account to show our gratitude."`
	"CN-15328" `	"You can keep the money. I would rather continue exploring further."`
	"CN-15329" `	"Who are the Sheragi?"`
	"CN-15330" `	"You might not have heard the name, but you have certainly been into their territory. They are a long extinct species, once inhabiting what has become the Rim and the South of human space. The same area where, not too long ago, you got the material we are currently using to power Ssil Vida," they reply, making a gesture in the direction of the station's reactor.`
	"CN-15331" `	"I can tell you that, as far as we know, they were roughly concurrent with the Builders; but this is the wealth of information I learnt during the work in Postverta. It is a continuously evolving field, and I have not been able to follow it closely beyond the engineering research on this station."`
	"CN-15332" `	"Oh. Fascinating." They seem quite pleased by your reply. "Well, in that case, I could try calling Kumkapi again to see if they have something you could help them with. I have a lot to catch up with, but I will try to get back to you as soon as I hear from them."`
	"CN-15333" `	You wait for Gavriil for nearly an hour, but they don't show up again. Just before leaving, you notice they sent you a communication on your datapad. "<first>," it reads, "I won't be able to meet up with you again today. I apologize for the impoliteness, but there is just too much I need to catch up with in order to keep the project on target.`
	"CN-15334" `	"Nevertheless, I was able to get in contact with the test range, and they seemed happy to get more help. I won't be able to come with you this time, but if you follow the same indications I gave you last time you should have no problems finding them.`
	"CN-15335" `	"Farewell, Captain, and may the Embers guide you back soon."`
	"CN-15336" `	"Farewell, Captain, and may the Embers guide you back soon," they gesture with a short bow.`
	"CN-15337" `<planet> looks far more active than it was just a few days ago. There is a Remnant ship on almost every landing pad close to the outpost, and there are even a couple Albatrosses in the middle of the sitting fleet. Luckily, you find a pad reserved for your arrival next to the main entrance.`
	"CN-15338" `	Before you have even reached the bottom of your ship's stairway, a group of locals has gathered below your ship with anticipation. You attempt to salute them, but they seem to be more interested in your ship: a few of them pry open a panel near your cargo bay, trying to connect with the payload controls.`
	"CN-15339" `	You try to ask for explanations, but they direct you toward the pad manager. Finally, after spending what feels like an hour trying to make your way through the crowd, you find her handling the loading operations at the back of a Merganser.`
	"CN-15340" `	(Ask her about my mission.)`
	"CN-15341" `	"What are they doing with my ship?"`
	"CN-15342" `	"It seems there must have been some miscommunications along the way," she signs in reply to your queries. "Sorry, but we have not had anything close to this amount of traffic for at least the past thirty years. We cannot afford to waste even a single minute right now.`
	"CN-15343" `	"Ever since someone brought us that satellite a few days ago," she continues, seemingly oblivious about who you are, "there have been a constant stream of captains wanting to take a look at it and do all kinds of analysis. We are not staffed for this kind of traffic, not even close."`
	"CN-15344" `	You try to inquire further about your mission, but she does not seem to know any more than you do. She redirects you again to the pad, pointing toward the bill of landing attached to the cargo they are mounting on your ship.`
	"CN-15345" `	At last, you find in there the information you needed: your payload is a large penetrating scanner, and your task is to use it just above the surface of <stopovers> in a specified location near the south pole of that moon to try to locate the quarantine facility.`
	"CN-15346" `Unlike many of the moons you have visited in the Ember Waste, nothing about Alix stands out as particularly unique. It is a small, rocky moon orbiting close above the Pathera gas giant, nearly atmosphereless and showing an appropriately low gravity. Its surface is punctuated by millions of small meteoroid impacts, certainly attracted by Pathera's deep gravity well. Even <starting planet> had a couple of gas giants with moons in every way similar to this one.`
	"CN-15347" `	The Builders seem to have found some interesting uses for it, however. Among the destroyed settlements all around Alix, vast mining facilities not only survived the attacks, but still see a constant stream of Ka'mar vehicles coming to gather their mineral cargo and deliver it to the imposing Ka'het station orbiting the same star.`
	"CN-15348" `	Strangely enough, this moon does not show any sign of strip mining, or in fact any digging at all. After operating mining facilities for a hundred thousand years, the surface should show clearly visible signs of such an intensive operation, but there seem to be none.`
	"CN-15349" `	(Fly closer to the mining outposts to investigate.)`
	"CN-15350" `	(Move to the target location the Remnant gave me.)`
	"CN-15351" `	You pitch down your ship and steer toward the nearest outpost: a long series of short buildings with angled roofs, reminiscent of a solar field in your ship's screen. After coming closer, however, you realize your initial guess was wrong - these are not akin to roofs, but to sails, composed of a pale white textile. A thin layer of dust covers their surface, mostly gathered toward the bottom.`
	"CN-15352" `	You try to come closer, but the compass on your ship suddenly starts spinning randomly! Alarmed, you swiftly reverse course to move away from the facility, and the instrumentation soon returns to normal again after a reboot. The automated outpost is clearly emitting a strong magnetic field, but the connection among all this isn't immediately obvious.`
	"CN-15353" `	(Do a close flyby, even if the compass goes haywire.)`
	"CN-15354" `	(Try to search around the facility, keeping a safe distance.)`
	"CN-15355" `	(Give up and move to the original target.)`
	"CN-15356" `	A brief exploration doesn't turn up anything you hadn't already seen earlier, and all you can do is watch as the mesmerizing flow of Faes'mar in and out of the facility continues undisturbed below you.`
	"CN-15357" `	Just as you're starting to feel that this mystery will remain unsolved, you have a stroke of luck: a small meteorite hits the surface a few kilometers away from you, throwing a cloud of debris in every direction. You check the composition of the nearly imperceptible atmosphere near the surface, and find it composed almost entirely of precious metal particles.`
	"CN-15358" `	The overall picture has become clearer: the frequent asteroid impacts on a moon like this raise enough meteorite dust to effectively shroud the planet in an extremely sparse atmosphere, which the Builder machines attract and gather so that they can be transported off-planet afterwards. It's a slow and cumbersome process, but it's also one that was able to work for tens of thousands of years without maintenance.`
	"CN-15359" `	You record a brief log of your thoughts, and move on to the target location. The mining facilities you see become progressively smaller and more sporadic, until they disappear completely. Flying just above a series of increasingly featureless highlands, you eventually reach your destination: an unremarkable plateau extending for kilometers in every direction.`
	"CN-15360" `	You pitch down and lower your altitude to look for debris, but you're not able to find anything useful. There were many ruins on the way here that could have certainly been a quarantine site at some point, but there's absolutely nothing here, as if it was never even inhabited in the first place.`
	"CN-15361" `	Perplexed, you turn your ship around and activate the high-power scanners the Remnant gave you. The task is very tedious: you have to pass over every bit of terrain going at just the right speed, careful not to skew the data with any abrupt movements, so that the instruments can function correctly.`
	"CN-15362" `	It takes an hour, but a familiar beep from the cockpit panel finally signals you can come back to <destination> to deliver the data.`
	"CN-15363" `Unlike your last visit, the testing range on <planet> has become eerily empty once again. Gone are the hectic crowds and the massive fleets occupying every parking spot: the few ships that are still here are rarely bigger than a Petrel. Enticed, you set sight on a random pad in the vicinity of the facility and touch down softly.`
	"CN-15364" `	With a datapad in your hand and the pad workers unloading your used mission equipment, you start looking around for someone to deliver the data to. The only people you can find nearby are the ones working on your ship, as well as the pad manager you had met earlier.`
	"CN-15365" `	"They relented!" she signs excitedly after noticing you. "It took a few days, but they finally accepted that we do not have the facilities nor the personnel to handle such traffic, and moved the satellite to a more appropriate laboratory. Somewhere on Aventine, I believe."`
	"CN-15366" `	"Is there someone I can give this data to?"`
	"CN-15367" `	"The location you gave me did not seem to have been inhabited."`
	"CN-15368" `	You give her a brief summary of your mission, and of your findings. "I am afraid the people you were supposed to deliver this data to have left together with the satellite," she replies, perplexed. "It has been busy for all of us recently, and some steps were skipped to accelerate the process.`
	"CN-15369" `	"If you leave the datapad here, I promise I will make sure it gets into the right hands. I am sure they will contact you themselves after things have calmed down a bit." You hand her the tablet with the info you recorded, hopeful it will reach its destination.`
	"CN-15370" `The gloomy feel of the local spaceport appears to be somehow even more pronounced today. Very few Korath are doing anything but the most basic maintenance of the local facilities, as if they all had their attention elsewhere. It doesn't take you long to notice the gathering of a considerable number of Korath by one large, blackened side of an abandoned building, which seems to be the reason for the drop in the local morale.`
	"CN-15371" `	As you approach the group, you notice a few Korath children running their hands over the dark wall, scratching it carefully with what must be something akin to crayons, or some material that could perform the same function. After they play around for a while, you notice all their drawings seem to take a similar shape: a beige or brownish circle, with some shy spots of blue, and rare bits of green. Contrasted by the onyx background of the building wall, you easily make it out to be a planet.`
	"CN-15372" `	Up close, you see many adult and elderly Korath, gathered as if in a prayer group around a shrine of sorts, just a few steps away from the building. They are mostly silent but for a few brief gasps. The shrine seems to be simply a pile of common crates and boxes, hidden by a dusty canvas that's not large enough to cover all of the cubic components of the pyramid-like structure.`
	"CN-15373" `	At the bottom of the shrine, the Korath seem to have deposited a plethora of personal belongings - clothing pieces, tools, pictures and coins, books and crystals, large fragments of cracked eggshells, flasks of oils or other substances, small jewelry pieces, and all manner of beads. The items seem to pile on and on endlessly, as every passing Korath in the spaceport makes a point to pass by the shrine and leave something as an offering.`
	"CN-15374" `	On the first level of crates, you first see a number of wooden, stone, and metal slabs, with various scratch marks over them. Upon closer inspection, you see that from certain angles, the marks combine to form shapes like those of the planet drawn by the children. The marks also form many other planets, with clearly defined oceans and continents. There are stars, systems, symbols you can't recognize, and a great number of tablets with nothing but writing.`
	"CN-15375" `	One of the oldest Korath in the gathering, who had been shivering with his head in his hands since before you approached, lets out an agonizing, bark-like yelp in a frayed voice. He looks up to the top of the shrine. Standing at navel height, one lone crate supports only a few items. A large, colorful feather, an amazingly complex seashell, and a mysteriously beautiful flower sit on the top crate, all surrounding one single, lone candle, which looks as if it's been burning for hours on end.`
	"CN-15376" `	You wonder how this one candle could be burning for so long out in the open, and think that perhaps the Korath simply relight it whenever it is put out by a passing gust. Only at that thought do you notice that, today, there is no wind whatsoever on <origin>.`
	"CN-15377" `	Seemingly only taking notice of you now, one of the younger Korath sitting by the shrine slowly rises, making her way over to you, and briefly holds up her hands with both palms facing you. She speaks quickly, and you cannot understand most of it, but you do recognize the words "humani efreti" at the end of what you guess was a question.`
	"CN-15378" `	"What exactly is all of this?"`
	"CN-15379" `	(Gesture inquisitively at the shrine.)`
	"CN-15380" `	"Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. I'll be on my way."`
	"CN-15381" `	Either due to somehow having understood your meaning, or simply having correctly guessed the reason for your curiosity, the Korath begins to attempt to explain the gathering. She grabs some of the crayon-like objects and beckons you a little closer to the wall, where she begins to draw many spiral arms in white, converging in what looks like a large maw at the center. She repeatedly jabs the crayon at a point close to the center, then at you, then at herself. "<origin>," she says.`
	"CN-15382" `	She then draws on the wall with a different crayon of a light-green coloring. The green seems to make a path to another dot, closer to the maw, though she takes great care to draw something like a barrier around the position - as if shielding it from the center of her spiral map. She stares at the dot thoughtfully for a few seconds, as if in disbelief of what she had just drawn herself. "Far'en Lai," she finally says, her voice cracking slightly, still facing the dot. Then, she looks back and points directly at the burning candle. "Far'en Lai," she says again, before looking back at you.`
	"CN-15383" `	Reaching in her garments, she pulls out what looks to be some form of communication device. She considers it briefly, then gestures for you to follow her back to the shrine, where she carefully places the object down onto the pile of offerings. She then looks at you, as if wondering if you would follow the gesture.`
	"CN-15384" `	(Offer 100 credits.)`
	"CN-15385" `	(Offer 10,000 credits.)`
	"CN-15386" `	(Offer 10,000,000 credits.)`
	"CN-15387" `	(Offer a picture of my home planet.)`
	"CN-15388" `	"I'm sorry, but I have nothing to offer. Goodbye."`
	"CN-15389" `	You remember the picture of your hometown back in <starting planet> you tend to carry around, and start searching for it. Sure enough, you find it inside your back pocket, straighten it out as best as you can, and go to add it to the pile. However, the Korath stops you, holding your arm and stretching her hand carefully as if asking for the picture. You hand it to her, and she brings it very close to her eyes. The elderly Korath who wailed before appears beside her, and she shows him the picture. He seems to stare at it for minutes on end, and you begin to wonder if you somehow offended them with your choice. Then, he hands her back the picture, and seems to nod slightly. She heads close to the shrine and places the picture at the top level, with the feather, shell, and flower. The elderly Korath faces you, looking deeply into your eyes, then raises his palms toward you, letting out a faint bark. You notice all other Korath around the shrine are doing the same. When they've all acknowledged your contribution, the Korath who drew the spiral arms comes to you again, looking thoroughly impressed.`
	"CN-15390" `	You add the credit chip to the objects by the shrine, and she seems to nod approvingly before looking at you once more, seemingly satisfied with your understanding of the gesture.`
	"CN-15391" `	You add the credit chips to the objects by the shrine, and she and a few of the other Korath seem to bow lightly to you. She turns to you once more, looking satisfied with your understanding of the gesture.`
	"CN-15392" `	You attempt to carefully place the credit chips onto the pile of objects by the shrine, but despite your efforts a few end up slipping out and dropping down rather noisily. The Korath, however, seem in shock rather than disturbed at your addition. Many of them raise their hands up, their palms to you in greeting or in thanks. You look back at the Korath who drew the spiral arms, who seems to be beaming.`
	"CN-15393" `	She raises her hands up towards you again, as if bidding you farewell, as you head away from the shrine. You notice many of the Korath around the spaceport take a few glances at you, but still seem focused entirely on the shrine regardless of what activity they may be performing.`
	"CN-15394" `A few of the Korath who inhabit this station greet you when you land, holding up both hands with their palms toward you. One of them says something that sounds like, "Humani efreti, naskoor amasavarkta." It's clear that none of them speak your language, but they seem friendly and willing to trade with you.`
	"CN-15395" `A few of the Korath in this spaceport greet you when you land, holding up both hands with their palms toward you. One of them says something that sounds like, "Humani efreti, naskoor amasavarkta." It's clear that none of them speak your language, but they seem friendly and willing to trade with you.`
	"CN-15396" `As you're exploring the spaceport, a Wanderer you've not met waves you down. It says, "You are Captain <last>, correct?"`
	"CN-15397" `	"Yes, that's me."`
	"CN-15398" `	"The one and only."`
	"CN-15399" `	"I am [relieved, happy] to see you, Captain. We have heard of your assistance in our migration here, and I [believe, assume] you have spent some time on Korath worlds. Would you be interested in taking <tons> of [supplies, aid] to <planet>? I can offer you <payment>."`
	"CN-15400" `	"I can do that. Load it up, and I'll be ready to leave."`
	"CN-15401" `	"Only <payment>? That's an unusually low payment for the amount of cargo I'll be carrying."`
	"CN-15402" `	"What exactly would I be transporting?"`
	"CN-15403" `	"Sorry, but I'm too busy at the moment to take on another job."`
	"CN-15404" `	"As I am sure you are aware, <planet> is cold - uncomfortably so for most species. Based on our [research, information], the planet is experiencing an accelerated [descent, transition] into an ice age. The Kor Efreti have no effective means of stopping this, and their [pride, honor] means they will not accept our terraforming assistance unless they have no other options. They will, however, pay us for equipment to offset this [descent, transition]. Your [supplies, aid] would include warmer clothing, greenhouse building material, [insulation, shelter], and other technology for the Korath to use. The payment, while [unfortunately, sadly] low, is all the Korath were able to offer.`
	"CN-15405" `	"I was originally going to make the journey myself, but my ship has encountered [errors, complications] due to a faulty component. I need someone to go in my place."`
	"CN-15406" `	"I'd be happy to, especially since it's for a good cause. You're welcome to load it up onto my ship."`
	"CN-15407" `	The Wanderer shudders slightly, almost like it had hoped you wouldn't ask that. "Well... yes, it is low. The rest of the Kor Efreti's payment was used to [purchase, acquire] the supplies, and it seemed they could not afford to pay much more than they already had. Given their situation, we found it [reasonable, justifiable] to accept the lower payment, as the cargo is a [collection, menagerie] of equipment to help with the cooling climate on <planet>, and without it the Kor Efreti might... [perish? expire?]."`
	"CN-15408" `	"I understand, and the money isn't a huge problem. I was just curious. Load it up onto my ship, and I'll be ready to go."`
	"CN-15409" `	"Oh. Well, I'll make an exception too. Load it up, and I'll head out."`
	"CN-15410" `	"Sorry, but I can't make that trip for only <payment>. You'll have to find someone else."`
	"CN-15411" `	The Wanderer deflates a little when it hears your response. "Oh. I understand. Thank you for your time, Captain <last>," it says, then it wanders off to look for another pilot.`
	"CN-15412" `	The Wanderer is happy to hear your response. "Wonderful! I will ensure the supplies are loaded onto your ship [immediately, quickly]. Thank you, Captain." It hurries off to a group of Wanderers nearby and starts barking orders. The group breaks up, and within minutes they're at your ship loading the supplies.`
	"CN-15413" `When you arrive on <planet>, a group of Korath is waiting to unload the cargo. You try and imitate their gesture of greeting, holding your hands up with your palms toward the group. They look surprised but hiss approvingly.`
	"CN-15414" `	Soon, all the supplies are off of your ship. The Korath give you a gesture of appreciation, then they begin unpacking it right in the middle of the spaceport. Already, a crowd has begun to gather around the equipment. It looks like it will be put to good use here. When you return to your ship, you see the Wanderer who offered you the job has transferred you your payment of <payment>.`
	"CN-15415" `The smog is so thick on Laki Nemparu that even the brightest hours of the day feel like evening to you. Everything here is so dirty that most of the Korath look a few shades darker than those of other planets. Within minutes, a small layer of soot clings to your skin as well.`
	"CN-15416" `	As you observe your surroundings, a Kor Efret approaches you followed by two others, one likely a child based on its size and the other hunched over a cane it uses for support - probably elderly. The one in front speaks in the Korath language and quickly realizes you don't understand it at all. The Kor Efret pauses to take a deep breath, then erupts into a coughing fit as they inhale far too much smog. It's almost a full minute before they recover.`
	"CN-15417" `	The Korath points up to the sky and says, "<planet>, <planet>," while gesturing to the two Korath with them. They press 500 credits into your hands and continue to mutter in the Korath language. <planet> is the name of the Quarg ringworld in Korath space. They must want transportation to it. 500 credits is shockingly low for any transport job, but based on their appearance they can't afford to pay you any more. Do you want to take them to <planet>?`
	"CN-15418" `	(Yes, and give their credits back to them.)`
	"CN-15419" `	You pocket the credits and gesture for them to follow to your ship. When the Korath realizes you've agreed, they sigh in relief and rapidly gesture in gratitude. You show them to their bunks... and the shower.`
	"CN-15420" `	The Korath's shoulders slump when you hand back the credits, but their disappointment turns to surprise when you gesture to your ship. When they realize you're trying to refuse the money, they puff their chest out and push the credits into your hands again. They won't take no for an answer, so you pocket the credits and take them to your ship. You show them to their bunks... and the shower.`
	"CN-15421" `	You give the credits back to the Korath, and their shoulders slump. You watch the trio wander off until they're no longer visible through the thick smog. You can't help but feel a little bad.`
	"CN-15422" `You enjoy the new company on your ship. The child has taught you a game where you take turns throwing a ball against the wall. You spend an hour or two playing with them in the cargo hold.`
	"CN-15423" `	When you arrive, you decide to accompany the family into the spaceport. Waiting near the docking bay are two more Korath, one an adult and the other elderly, and the three you've transported rush to meet them. After the happy reunion has died down, the Korath who had originally asked you for transportation turns to a nearby Quarg and says something. The Quarg responds and then turns to you.`
	"CN-15424" `	"This fellow pridefulest has claimed he regarded my indebted translation with reverence and asks my usage of it be preferred. I am inclined to acquiesce his request happyfully." This Quarg does not seem to have an especially strong grasp of your language, but you should be able to more or less gather what is being said. "The comrade says, 'I disproportionately thank you for reuniting my familial, in fateful service to our camaraderie.' He additionally supplants there was no method in which this gaggle would vicinitied in which absenced your presence. That is all."`
	"CN-15425" `	"Tell him it's no problem at all."`
	"CN-15426" `	"Tell him he has a wonderful family, and I was glad to help."`
	"CN-15427" `	The Quarg nods and turns to translate. The Korath responds while holding his palms toward you and moving them in a wide circular motion. "This is indicating of thankfulness of wholesomest measure. He thanks you for your fortunate words and wishes you kind travels," the Quarg says. You acknowledge the response, thank the Quarg for its (rough) translation services, and return to your ship.`
	"CN-15428" `A Kor Efret wearing several layers made of a wool-like fabric approaches you. It raises both its palms toward you, then it gestures for you to follow into an alley. You don't think it poses any threat, but it can't hurt to be cautious.`
	"CN-15429" `	(Follow into the alleyway.)`
	"CN-15430" `	(Play it safe and leave.)`
	"CN-15431" `	The Korath weaves through the buildings, heading deeper into an abandoned section of the city. The Korath turns a corner, and as a cold wind rushes over you, an alarmingly loud bleating noise emanates from around the corner.`
	"CN-15432" `	(Turn the corner.)`
	"CN-15433" `	(Turn around and try to run back to the spaceport.)`
	"CN-15434" `	You hear the shuffling of feet behind you and turn around. Three towering Korath wearing similar heavy clothing have stepped out of a nearby doorway and are making their way toward you. The bleating noise returns, and you turn again, only to see the original Kor Efret has returned from around the corner. Whatever chance you had of getting out of this is gone now.`
	"CN-15435" `	The one in front turns back to where it came from, and the Korath behind you hisses and gestures forward. It looks like you should follow. You brace yourself and turn the corner to see... animals?`
	"CN-15436" `	The rusting buildings have given way to a massive abandoned plaza, and the entire space is taken up by a mix of large livestock and supplies. They remind you of sheep, but they're around five times larger, have six legs, and come in a variety of brown-black colors. Each has a full coat of fur and an additional blanket made of their own wool-like fabric on them. It's the same material these Korath are wearing. Even with their extra blanket, the "sheep" are huddled in small groups and look uncomfortably cold. They occasionally bleat loudly whenever a cold wind rushes through the plaza. Fortunately for you, these Kor Efreti look to be farmers, not muggers. This must have been the only place near the spaceport where they could keep their entire herd together.`
	"CN-15437" `	The one who led you here, who also seems to be the leader, gestures for you to come over to it. It has opened a paper map - a rare sight in the era of interstellar travel. When you take a look, you realize it's not of the local area, but space; it seems to show the surrounding systems. The Korath points to one, pauses and gestures broadly at the mix of livestock and supplies, then draws its finger to another system and says something that sounds roughly like <planet>. "<planet>?" you confirm, and the Korath hisses in approval. It looks like they want transportation there. You wager the livestock and supplies will take up roughly <tons>, and there are <bunks> Korath farmers in the group.`
	"CN-15438" `	It pulls a stack of 200 credits from its pocket and sets it on the ground before drawing a circle around it with a piece of chalk. It then draws four more, makes a large circle around the five total smaller ones, then draws nine additional large circles. Your best guess is it's offering 10,000 credits for their transport.`
	"CN-15439" `	(Agree to take them.)`
	"CN-15440" `	(Decline the job.)`
	"CN-15441" `	You indicate your agreement by pointing to <planet> on the map and gesturing to yourself. Once it understands you've agreed, the Korath holds its palms toward you and moves them in a circular motion. You lead one to your ship while the rest stay behind to prepare the animals. When you arrive, it immediately goes to work spreading tarps over the floor and scattering a type of straw over them. After some time, you notice one of the "sheep" emerge from an alleyway led by a farmer that had stayed behind. Behind it is another animal, then another. The line of livestock, interspersed with the farmers keeping things moving, slowly makes it way into your hangar over the next hour.`
	"CN-15442" `	As they enter your climate-controlled ship, the farmers take the hefty, wool-like blankets off the "sheep" and remove most of their own layers. One takes the entire pile of fabric to a nearby vendor and exchanges it for credits while the others go back and grab the supplies still in the plaza. By nightfall, everything and everyone is finally loaded onto your ship. The Korath who had sold the clothes to the merchant gives you the entire stack of 4,100 credits. Hopefully you'll get the rest after you get to <planet>.`
	"CN-15443" `The animals are surprisingly comfortable on the ship, but the Korath struggle. Based on how often they're in and out of the bathroom during the one-jump trip, none of them have been in hyperspace before. When they get over their space sickness, they busy themselves shaving the wool-like fur off the animals and gathering it.`
	"CN-15444" `	As you land and open the cargo doors to reveal the hot world of <planet>, the animals shift excitedly. They seem much more energetic than any time before now, so much so that the Korath have some trouble keeping them all together as they exit the ship. The slow desertification of this planet is surely a cause for concern, but it seems to provide a much healthier environment for these animals than Setar Fort's chilling temperatures do. Once everything is off your ship, a Korath takes the wool to another vendor and again sells it, then it returns and hands you 5,900 credits. With the 4,100 credits it gave you before leaving, you've received all 10,000 promised credits. It holds its hands up with its palms toward you then leaves to join the other farmers.`
	"CN-15445" `The occasional blue flashes of Quarg ships are nothing new as you travel Efreti space. Usually that is all you see of the enigmatic aliens. Today, however, you receive an urgent hail from one of them as you land.`
	"CN-15446" `	"Salutations, Captain of the <ship>. Victims of uncertain fate need your most diligent efforts, lest many families mourn the dead. Mereti drones waylayed the Efreti ship <EDC-ship> near <planet> ere it could elude. Two score Korath still live, awaiting rescue."`
	"CN-15447" `	"I'll go there immediately."`
	"CN-15448" `	"Can't the Quarg respond?"`
	"CN-15449" `	"I don't care about the Korath."`
	"CN-15450" `	"We vanquished the Mereti, but the <EDC-ship> fell beyond our reach at landfall. Without strong plate, we fare ill on a heavy world. A human can reach them days before an expedition from Kuwaru Efreti."`
	"CN-15451" `	"I'll go help, then."`
	"CN-15452" `	"I won't risk my ship for the Korath."`
	"CN-15453" `	The Quarg is silent for some time. Eventually it responds, "Life is rare and precious across the vastness of space. Look about the Korath worlds and see what remains when one cares not what others suffer."`
	"CN-15454" `It takes you some time to find the <EDC-ship>. You had expected a beacon of some sort, but either they are keeping radio silence to avoid drawing the Mereti, or there were no survivors. When you manage to open the hatch, you find yourself staring down a thermal rifle.`
	"CN-15455" `	The Korath shouts something at you, and you hold your hands out with your palms forward. He limps back a few steps, but keeps the weapon trained on you. Slowly pulling a communicator out, you play a recording of the Quarg transmission you received earlier. Once the Korath hears the Quarg's voice, he becomes excited and lowers his rifle. "<planet>?" he asks repeatedly. You nod your head and show your palms again.`
	"CN-15456" `	He leads you into the ship, shouting into a communication device that is then broadcasted on speakers throughout the vessel. You can only glance around as you move through the engineering section, but it's clear they are running on emergency power, and several important-looking systems are destroyed. The living area is a makeshift hospital. You don't see any bodies, but there are far fewer Korath here than you would expect to crew a ship of this size. It's clear that all the surviving crew are injured to some degree, while more than half are incapacitated or unconscious. Even if the ship is spaceworthy, there aren't enough crew to fly it.`
	"CN-15457" `	You quickly count the number of survivors and communicate to your guide that you can take them all. He mimics your nodding head gesture, shows you his palms, and makes quick circles. You think he is agreeing and wants to hurry. Calling your crew over to help, the survivors are moved onboard the <ship>. Within a couple of hours you are ready to go.`
	"CN-15458" `	You quickly count the number of survivors and communicate to your guide that you can take them all. He mimics your nodding head gesture, shows you his palms, and makes quick circles. You think he is agreeing and wants to hurry. With no crew helping you, it takes several hours to transfer the survivors to the <ship>.`
	"CN-15459" `Medical crews await you once you land, and it takes several hours to evacuate the injured. Doctors, or maybe paramedics, swarm over them to triage, treat, and prepare them for transport. Three who died during the flight are treated with respect and carried off the <ship>.`
	"CN-15460" `	When you make it to the spaceport, you find a message from the Quarg. "Bold human! With profuse thanks we offer you for helping the stranded Korath. The Korath ever mourn the loss of their worlds, and, from time to time, brave their dangers. They salvage what they can among the ruins, and seek out worlds where they may one day live again. For the young, this gives them hope, but sometimes they are caught, and the Efreti are reminded why they live crushed together around these few stars."`
	"CN-15461" `	Your communicator notifies you of a payment of <payment>.`
	"CN-15462" `Before you can leave, a delegation of Korath approach you somewhat hesitantly. They are dressed in what appears to be much finer clothing than most Korath you have met, certainly nothing you would wear to do work in a spaceport. As they make the traditional gesture of greeting, which you return, you are curious both as to what they want and how they will ask.`
	"CN-15463" `	One of them takes a small case out of a pocket and removes a black device that looks like three triangles hooked together. He hisses at it for a moment and it rises out of his hand. The air around it begins to shimmer, followed by the appearance of a life-sized hologram of a Quarg.`
	"CN-15464" `	"Salutations, far traveler," the Quarg rumbles. "These Korath-Friends are the princes of the clan that you assisted. While grateful for the living, they cannot fully mourn those that lie dead. They beseech you travel back to <planet> and bring their lost ones home to <origin>."`
	"CN-15465" `	"I will bring them home."`
	"CN-15466" `	"I will if they pay me."`
	"CN-15467" `	"I won't risk my ship for the dead."`
	"CN-15468" `	The leader of the group visibly sags as the Quarg translates your words. Two younger Korath bear him up as the group turns and leaves.`
	"CN-15469" `	You hadn't realized how tense the group was until you saw them relax as your words reach them. They seem relieved at your answer.`
	"CN-15470" `	The group relaxes quickly as you see a ripple of relief and pride pass through them.`
	"CN-15471" `	The leader turns and speaks to you directly. His eyes never waver from yours even as you wait for the translation. "Efreti crews have families, as children learn by working with parents. For some families, three generations were lost. We will not try to salvage the ship, for none can bear to fly it. We offer you title to salvage the <EDC-ship> and carry our grief far from here."`
	"CN-15472" `Locating the <EDC-ship>, you and your crew enter it wearing environment suits. It's been several days since the crash, and Korath ships run hot. This will be an unpleasant task in the suits and perhaps impossible without them.`
	"CN-15473" `Locating the <EDC-ship>, you enter it wearing an environment suit. It's been several days since the crash, and Korath ships run hot. This will be an unpleasant task in the suit and perhaps impossible without it, especially with no crew helping you.`
	"CN-15474" `	While your engineer works on refreshing the atmosphere with outside air, the rest of the crew gathers the bodies and places them in the fibrous, vaguely egg-shaped coffins the Korath provided. As you move them to your cargo bay, you find they stack together like a clutch of eggs in a nest.`
	"CN-15475" `	While your crewmate works on refreshing the atmosphere with outside air, you gather the bodies and place them in the fibrous, vaguely egg-shaped coffins the Korath provided. As you move them to your cargo bay, you find they stack together like a clutch of eggs in a nest.`
	"CN-15476" `	One by one, you gather the bodies and place them in fibrous, vaguely egg-shaped coffins the Korath provided. As you move them to your cargo bay, you find they stack together like a clutch of eggs in a nest. It takes a while to refresh the atmosphere with outside air before the smell is tolerable.`
	"CN-15477" `	Returning to the Korath ship, you carefully gather all the personal effects you can find in the living quarters and box them for transport. You've no way of knowing if those Korath in the photographs you find are now safely recovering or lying in your hold.`
	"CN-15478" `	The crew makes a last sweep to move debris, both to assess for repairs later and to make sure you haven't missed anyone, or parts of them. You clean and disinfect as best you can and return to your ship for the trip to <destination>.`
	"CN-15479" `	As a precaution, you make a last sweep to move debris, both to assess for repairs later and to make sure you haven't missed anyone, or parts of them. You clean and disinfect as best you can and return to your ship for the trip to <destination>.`
	"CN-15480" `A crowd pours out of the spaceport when you land. It takes some time for the workers to establish barricades and clear a path so the transports can get to your cargo hold. A team in uniform greets you formally when you open the hatch, and you count the coffins together with them. Afterwards, you show them the boxes of possessions, which they handle with care. An officer thanks you and hands you a data chip that vaguely reminds you of a license.`
	"CN-15481" `	The crowd has been somber, but when the first coffin leaves your ship, they erupt in a cacophony of barking sounds. Some Korath try to rush forward but are held back by others, presumably their family.`
	"CN-15482" `	Rather than intrude on their grief, you return to your ship, slotting the data chip you received into your systems. Unfortunately, the information is in an alien language, so you set it aside and work on a plan to salvage the <EDC-ship>. Gathering some notes on the ship and the number of crew they were carrying, it's clear that you will need to carry at least 66 additional crew that you can communicate with to be able to salvage it. The closest system that comes to mind with many human speakers is on Greenwater, in Hai space.`
	"CN-15483" `Many stories tell of Hai who like change and excitement, but their enthusiasm seems to have died. Thoughts of the species that invaded them still inspire fear. No Hai have the courage to salvage a ship that has been caught in the crossfire of the Mereti and Sestor war.`
	"CN-15484" `	Fortunately, there are plenty of humans who are willing to risk it for the right pay, even given the comfortable life they have in Hai space. You show the new crew members to their bunks and prepare to salvage the <EDC-ship>.`
	"CN-15485" `Thanks to the work of your crew, the atmosphere on the ship is brought to human standards, if a bit tropical. As the salvage continues, you and your crew start to become familiar with the ship. Its strong hull appears spaceworthy, but the ship has barely any weapons, the battery systems are beyond repair, and shield regeneration is impossible. If the Mereti attack, the <EDC-ship> won't be able to survive long.`
	"CN-15486" `	(Fly the <EDC-ship> home.)`
	"CN-15487" `	(Abandon the ship.)`
	"CN-15488" `	Your crew abandons the Korath ship to the elements, just one more tragic story amid the ruins of their civilization.`
	"CN-15489" `	You manage to bring up the shields, at least initially, using the <ship>. Your crew on the <EDC-ship> take their stations as you prepare to evade Mereti patrols on your way to <destination>.`
	"CN-15490" `This time, there are no crowds waiting for you when you land; rather, the ground crews seem astonished to see the ship. It takes you some time to arrange for additional repairs, but by the time you're finished, a pavilion has been set up near the <EDC-ship>, and small groups of Korath periodically stop by.`
	"CN-15491" `	(I've got places to be.)`
	"CN-15492" `	The tent is larger than you expected. At the back there is a group of Korath arranged like a choir, but standing oddly still. A Korath in some kind of robe stands next to a table piled with sweets and cups of some kind of thick drink. As you approach, you realize that the "choir" is made of holograms. You do a quick mental count and guess that these are the Korath that died on the ship; this is probably some type of memorial. The Korath in robes greets you and presses a cup into your hand.`
	"CN-15493" `	(Drink it.)`
	"CN-15494" `	(Make a motion as if drinking.)`
	"CN-15495" `	Either the Efret don't notice your ruse, or they are too polite to say. They press the sweets on you so you take them. You see a few groups from the spaceport follow the same ritual, though some of them walk up to the "choir" and say something to them. When you finish the food, you take your leave and return to your ship.`
	"CN-15496" `	The drink is fermented, and has a sweet and sour taste that leaves your lips and mouth tingling, eventually numbing them. The Korath then presses the sweets on you, and you humbly accept them. A few groups from the spaceport follow the same ritual, though some of them walk up to the "choir" and say something to them. When you finish the food, you take your leave and return to your ship.`
	"CN-15497" `The Quarg have translated the Korath language for you in the past. You have the data chip from when you helped the Efret salvage the <EDC-ship>. Would you like to see if the Quarg can tell you what the data chip says?`
	"CN-15498" `	(Ask the Quarg to translate the data chip.)`
	"CN-15499" `	(I don't care what it says.)`
	"CN-15500" `	You approach one of the Quarg in the spaceport and request assistance with the data chip. It stops and acknowledges you, but doesn't speak. It pauses for a few moments after you make your request, but then holds out its hand. Taking the data chip, it slots it into a communicator of some sort, slowly nods to itself, and hands it back to you.`
	"CN-15501" `	You return to your ship and try plugging the chip into your systems again, which now displays two files: one in the Korath language, and one in your own. You open the file in your language, and it reads: "The <EDC-ship> is a ship of grief, bringing great pain in memories that sing for generations. Love is a void in the souls of many. Know all that <first> <last> is a true Efret by heart, if not by skin. The <EDC-ship> is theirs, to save lives and keep memories."`
	"CN-15502" `	You carefully store the chip in a safe place.`
	"CN-15503" `You scan this planet's surface and pick up only a single, faint energy source. Cautiously, you approach it, and find an abandoned fueling depot: a ring of landing pads around a cluster of tanks of all different shapes and sizes. Some of the tanks must be cryogenic, because they are covered in ice. A few slow-moving insectoid robots are busy clearing off the ice and cleaning the tanks, but they do not appear to be armed and you see no sign of any other creatures or of any defense systems.`
	"CN-15504" `	You land your ship. Your sensors say the air is safe to breathe, but you wear a respirator just in case as you step off your ship and explore the depot. The spider robots pay no attention to you. From the fact that some of the tanks are covered in frost and others are not, you would guess that each one contains a different fuel, and each tank has dozens of different connectors branching off from it. With surprise, you discover that one of those connectors is the style used in human space, and you are able to use it to refuel your ship.`
	"CN-15505" `	Other than the robots and the fog swirling in the valley below you, there is no sign of life or motion here, and the air is uncomfortably moist and cold despite the hot steam rising up from a few nearby vents in the ground.`
	"CN-15506" `This world is populated by the Pug, the same enigmatic species that recently invaded human space - and left without giving you any clear answers about why they did so. Here, they appear peaceful enough, but they are ignoring you completely. Do you want to try to talk to one of them?`
	"CN-15507" `	(No, don't risk it.)`
	"CN-15508" `	You try to talk to several of the Pug who are walking by, but they do not respond or even look at you. If you stand to block their path, they step around you, and you determine by intentionally bumping into one of them that they are real and not just a holographic projection. From the brief eye contact that a few of them make before looking away from you, you get the feeling that they are intentionally ignoring you.`
	"CN-15509" `	The Pug are not terribly strong. You could probably grab one of them and demand that it answer your questions, without much risk of it hurting you.`
	"CN-15510" `	(Grab one of them.)`
	"CN-15511" `	(Give up and leave.)`
	"CN-15512" `	You grab one of the Pug by the arm. "You need to give me some answers," you say. It begins to babble in a language you do not know, and a crowd of Pug gather around you. Eventually a few more of them arrive holding some sort of staff that they point at you menacingly, while shouting commands at you, again in their own language. It is possible that none of the Pug here actually speak the human language, in which case trying to communicate with them will be fruitless.`
	"CN-15513" `	(Let the Pug go, and walk away.)`
	"CN-15514" `	(Threaten to shoot them.)`
	"CN-15515" `	The moment you reach for your gun, one of the armed Pug fires a burst of light from its staff, and a warm, pleasant feeling washes over you - the most wonderful feeling you have ever experienced. In a daze, you begin to wander back to your ship, stopping occasionally to marvel at the things around you that you had not noticed before: the glittering of sunlight on the water, the sparkling drops of ocean spray hanging from the tips of sea marsh grass, the sky that has the bluest blueness of all the blues you have ever seen. It is all so beautiful that you start to cry. Once you reach your ship, you sit in the cockpit fascinated by the blinking lights on the control panel and unable to remember what any of them are for.`
	"CN-15516" `	A few hours later, the wonderful feeling is replaced by a wave of nausea and a pounding headache.`
	"CN-15517" `	You decide to play it safe and return to your ship. The Pug remain as enigmatic as ever.`
	"CN-15518" `You had seen pictures and videos of the Quarg before, but this is your first time in a spaceport that is owned by them. The architecture is truly alien: uncomfortably tall ceilings, strange colors, and walls that never quite seem to meet at right angles. The Quarg themselves are equally strange, towering above you, some nearly three meters tall. Their legs bend backwards at the bottom, like a dog walking on its hind feet, and they move gracefully and almost silently.`
	"CN-15519" `	Most of the Quarg you see are dressed entirely in shades of gray, or only slight hints of color. Quarg fashion seems to revolve not around color, but texture: coarse and fine woven fabrics, patterns like lizard scales or cobblestones, and occasional decorative fringes of sponge-like material. Their skin is deep gray, sometimes with a hint of green or blue or brown beneath it, with a fine scale pattern like a reptile. But what makes their eyes startling is that they look very human, except that some of them have gold or violet irises instead of green or blue or brown. They have no hair, but many are wearing small cloth caps or hoods.`
	"CN-15520" `	One of the Quarg notices you gawking at them and walks over. It squats down on its haunches so that its eyes are level with your own, and says, "Hello." Its voice is deep, sounding like an accordion or the buzz of a beehive blended with the hum of a starship engine.`
	"CN-15521" `	Speaking slowly and deliberately, it says, "I think you are new here. Are you what is called a tourist?"`
	"CN-15522" `	"No, I'm a merchant captain, I'm here to buy and sell cargo."`
	"CN-15523" `	"I see." The Quarg blinks slowly. Its eyelids come from the sides of its eyes, instead of up and down. In an otherwise so human eye, the effect is disconcerting. "Many humans have many questions when they see us, and we the Quarg live for many lifetimes of humans, so it is not burdensome for this one to speak with you."`
	"CN-15524" `	"Can you tell me about the Quarg?"`
	"CN-15525" `	"Are there other alien species in the galaxy?"`
	"CN-15526" `	"It is an honor to speak with you, but I do not have any questions."`
	"CN-15527" `	"Many. Most of them young, so much younger than the Quarg. Many foolish. A few wise. Many travel only along the ancient roads between the stars. A few need no roads to travel by. And some reshape the galaxy at will. But the Quarg are like no other, because we have nothing that the others covet."`
	"CN-15528" `	"We the Quarg are unique of all the species in the galaxy. Our species began on the moon of a great gas giant, on a planet most small, that gathered about itself very little air. We cannot step many steps on the worlds that the Hai, the Korath, the other species desire. And the worlds like our home, you could not breathe their so thin air, for our lungs are very subtle. And we are an old race, and do not kill for sport or whimsy, so the Drak gave us the gift, that we may go among the other races and settle where we please, and make friends of all, because none dare be our enemy."`
	"CN-15529" `	"Who are the Drak?"`
	"CN-15530" `	"Why do none dare to be your enemy?"`
	"CN-15531" `	"Because we are very strong, and because we speak with the Drak."`
	"CN-15532" `	"The Drak are the eldest living. Not the firstborn, for they are long gone, but the eldest living, and yet they are far younger than the stars. They tend and cultivate the pathways between the stars, and prune away the paths that any species could travel to make war against another. And they hold the secret of travel beyond those pathways, and give the secret only to a worthy few, so that peace may prevail." It taps its chest with one hand, signaling that the Quarg are among those few.`
	"CN-15533" `	"Not that the Drak are strangers to war. Planets and moons and even stars were consumed in their wars and are no more. But then they learned wisdom, and have fought no more wars, many millions of human years. They live nearby, but they keep to themselves, and intervene in the affairs of other races only to prevent their destruction or the use of obscene technologies of war."`
	"CN-15534" `	"We humans have used some rather destructive weapons against each other, and no alien species ever stepped in to put a stop to it."`
	"CN-15535" `	"Well, I hope we never do anything bad enough to force them to intervene."`
	"CN-15536" `	"You have done what? Awakened the atom? There are weapons far worse than that. Consuming planets. Snuffing out stars. Tearing the flesh of space and time itself. Weapons of chaos I pray your reckless race cannot yet even conceive of. These things will attract the attention of the Drak, because they nearly destroyed this galaxy once, and must not be allowed to do so again."`
	"CN-15537" `	"Well, if there are technologies that dangerous out there, I hope the Drak do continue to succeed in keeping them from being used."`
	"CN-15538" `	"I hope so too, human." The Quarg stands up, towering over you once again. "As long as you are a seeker of peace, you are most welcome on our worlds at any time." It bows to you. You are not sure if that is a Quarg gesture too, or if it is simply imitating a human custom, but you bow in return, and the Quarg walks quietly away.`
	"CN-15539" `In your past experience, you've never seen the Quarg move with anything approaching haste or excitement, but when you land on this station a group of them run up to you, moving faster than you thought they were able to. For a minute or two they just gawk at you and talk amongst themselves in their own language; you think you recognize the word "Humani," and perhaps, "Eartha."`
	"CN-15540" `	Finally a Quarg appears who speaks your language, or at least is willing to try. It says, "Salutations, astonishing sojourner. Whither came you, and wherefore visit you us here in the unquiet graveyard of the Korathi?"`
	"CN-15541" `	"I'm just here to explore. Can you tell me more about the Korath?"`
	"CN-15542" `	"I came here to learn what happened to the Korath."`
	"CN-15543" `	"Ah, the unwise Korath," it says. "Once a mighty empire, now sadly splintered and diminished. Their own thinking war machines, now breeding with abandon and inimical to all, hunt the survivors. And of them some, too, were exiled for their great crimes."`
	"CN-15544" `	"What crimes did they commit?"`
	"CN-15545" `	"What do you mean, 'thinking war machines'?"`
	"CN-15546" `	"Robotic starships, and autonomous factories to create them. Though now directed by no living being, they yet reproduce and wage against each other senseless war. Ware their ships should you wander north and east of here, for they wield weapons diverse and strange, and bring you can we no succor within the bourne of their space."`
	"CN-15547" `	"You mentioned 'crimes.' What crimes did they commit?"`
	"CN-15548" `	"Of that we shall not speak, lest awaken in you we the desire to in their footsteps follow. But you may observe the wreckage of their abominations and take warning."`
	"CN-15549" `	"You mentioned 'thinking war machines.' What are those?"`
	"CN-15550" `	You are interrupted as one of the Korath who inhabit this ringworld walks by, and the Quarg says, "Friend Korath, meet the human."`
	"CN-15551" `	"<first> <last>," you say, holding out a hand automatically. The Korath does not shake your hand, but instead greets you by holding up both hands, palms toward you. It says something in its own language, then hurries away.`
	"CN-15552" `	The Quarg says to you, "One faction among the Korathi sought peace. 'Korath Efreti,' they name themselves, which means 'Korath Friends.' They are under our protection and intend you no harm. But, they have not your language; here humans are rare. Another question have you?"`
	"CN-15553" `	"Will the friendly Korath let me purchase their technology?"`
	"CN-15554" `	"Why don't you destroy the robots, if they're such a threat?"`
	"CN-15555" `	"No, but I'm glad to meet you."`
	"CN-15556" `	"Visit their worlds," says the Quarg. "Though they learn not your words, you are clever and may speak as does one without words, by pointing at things." You thank it for its time, and the crowd of Quarg that has been gawking at you slowly disperses.`
	"CN-15557" `	It clicks its teeth together, which might be the Quarg equivalent of laughter. "It was hoped that one faction of robots would destroy the other, and leave for us less work to do, but they are sadly too evenly matched. Instead we merely restrain them from expanding, as one isolates a fire one cannot extinguish and for it to burn out waits." You thank it for its time, and the crowd of Quarg that has been gawking at you slowly disperses.`
	"CN-15558" `A Quarg slowly makes its way to you when it notices you in the spaceport. "Greetings, human friend. Would you happen to have the time to listen to a proposal? We are looking for a pilot willing to help us deploy some scanning satellites."`
	"CN-15559" `	"Sure, where am I deploying them?"`
	"CN-15560" `	"What are the satellites for?"`
	"CN-15561" `	"I don't have the time, no."`
	"CN-15562" `	"To help humans in the other end of this region, the South, be better prepared against incoming attacks, and help them keep track of ships that pass by their systems."`
	"CN-15563" `	"I'd like to help with that then. Where am I deploying them?"`
	"CN-15564" `	"Help? Why do you want to help people there all of a sudden?"`
	"CN-15565" `	"I am actually headed to a different part of the galaxy now, sorry."`
	"CN-15566" `	"Why?" It pauses for a second. "Surely you have seen the foolish thugs that plague this whole region. We can deal with them here, but we do not usually travel far. To promote peace all around, without even more needless slaughter, providing some measures to deter further attacks is but a courtesy."`
	"CN-15567" `	"To <waypoints>. Once you are done, return here and you will receive <payment>."`
	"CN-15568" `	As soon as you arrive at your ship, you find various Quarg with loaderbots, putting the four satellites inside your ship's cargo hold. The satellites are shaped like triangular pyramids, with each point of the main pyramid being tipped with another, smaller triangular pyramid. You can't quite make it out from this distance, but you wonder if the smaller pyramids are also tipped with even smaller pyramids. Each of the devices is roughly half your size, but probably weigh a lot more than you.`
	"CN-15569" `In the spaceport, a group of Quarg is talking to dozens of human captains. Some nod and head right back to their ships, while a few others remain and appear to discuss a bit more with the Quarg.`
	"CN-15570" `	(Join them to see what's going on.)`
	"CN-15571" `	You join the group, and one of the Quarg diverts its attention to you, while the others continue speaking with the human merchants.`
	"CN-15572" `	"Would you also be someone willing to provide us a cargo service, Captain?" it asks, all the while checking a data pad, which seems to be related to the ships docked here. "Not many of you humans in this region have the cargo space required, much less proper defenses for cargo convoys. We are willing to pay adequately for whoever meets the criteria and is willing to help us."`
	"CN-15573" `	"Are those other Captains also doing this? What do you need so much cargo for?"`
	"CN-15574" `	"I'm not looking for any more cargo jobs right now, sorry."`
	"CN-15575" `	"Many have agreed to help us already, but we still need many more. Those that have agreed to help are headed all to different portions of human space, to safely bring us the materials we have ordered.`
	"CN-15576" `	"Our ringworld, under construction around the star of <system>, is to have a special open section for humans to visit soon. We wish to make the internal style and decoration of that section closer to human standards, so we are asking every capable captain to help. You are one such captain, are you willing to help us?"`
	"CN-15577" `	"Alright, I'm interested. Where should I go to pick up the cargo?"`
	"CN-15578" `	"Sorry, I'm not looking for any cargo job right now, I was just curious."`
	"CN-15579" `	It fiddles with the data pad a bit more, then says, "You are to pick up <cargo> on <stopovers>, then deliver that cargo to <destination>. You will be paid <payment> for the service. Be well, human."`
	"CN-15580" `	It gestures a bow to you, then leaves to speak with another merchant captain that got curious as well.`
	"CN-15581" `Much like your own ship, several other human freighters and convoys are arriving, and the cargo being meticulously checked by the Quarg, as they use their own machinery to unload what must be tens of thousands of tons from all the ships.`
	"CN-15582" `	About halfway through the unloading of your own cargo, a Quarg comes up to you and hands you <payment>.`
	"CN-15583" `You've met the Coalition, and the Heliarchs that rule their space from within the ringworlds the Quarg built there who claim that they "defeated the Quarg oppressors." Would you like to look for some Quarg here and ask for their side of the story?`
	"CN-15584" `	You stop the first Quarg that passes by you, and ask if they could tell their side of the story about the Coalition.`
	"CN-15585" `	"Ah, so you have encountered the foolish Coalition," it begins. "They once were three promising species, before they succumbed to the unwise desire for usurpation of the great deeds of others.`
	"CN-15586" `	"Not that all of them are petty thieves, but sadly the civilization they have become is now ruled by a fanatical military, as I am sure you have seen, having spoken with those wretched Heliarchs."`
	"CN-15587" `	"Is it true that they defeated you?"`
	"CN-15588" `	"Is it true what they told me? That you oppressed them and hindered their development?"`
	"CN-15589" `	It clicks its teeth together for a moment, and frowns a bit. "Do not underestimate us, human. We are numerous, and we are strong." It pauses for a moment, with a blank expression on its face, as if trying to remember something. "We just know better than to slaughter billions for the sake of maintaining our position."`
	"CN-15590" `	"Of course not. Have you seen us do such things with humanity? Or with any other alien species you might have reached in your travels with a jump drive? The Heliarchs, like any other fanatical military, merely fabricated an excuse to justify attacking us."`
	"CN-15591" `	Before you can ask it anything else, the Quarg bids you farewell, and walks away.`
	"CN-15592" `As soon as you land, you see a crowd of Quarg gathering around one of your escorts, the Pug Arfecta. The captain of the ship looks shaken as the Quarg surround them, seemingly being questioned by a rather tall Quarg, even by Quarg standards. The captain looks around and, seeing you, points in your direction, causing the Quarg to come your way. The tall Quarg towers over you and gives you a piercing stare.`
	"CN-15593" `As soon as you land your ship, a crowd of Quarg start to gather around. As you go to disembark, you find a rather imposing Quarg blocking the exit. Tall even by Quarg standards, it towers over you and gives you a piercing stare.`
	"CN-15594" `	"It is as though a baby in swaddling has tamed a dragon and now rides it through the sky spewing fire with reckless abandon," it says while not breaking its gaze, unblinking.`
	"CN-15595" `	"It's a long story..."`
	"CN-15596" `	"It was an act of righteous defiance."`
	"CN-15597" `	"The Pug fancy themselves gods, but since God is dead..."`
	"CN-15598" `	"I saw something I liked, so I made it mine."`
	"CN-15599" `	It scoffs, "It matters not how it happened.`
	"CN-15600" `	"You fancy yourself a savior or a revolutionary then?" the Quarg says with what you assume is a sarcastic tone.`
	"CN-15601" `	"So you deign to prove them wrong?" the Quarg says with an almost amused, or perhaps incredulous tone.`
	"CN-15602" `	"A baby in swaddling, indeed...`
	"CN-15603" `	"We give you a warning. You know not what you have, human - what weapon you wield.`
	"CN-15604" `	"We have seen its power. We have felt it, and learned from it. But you and your kind know nothing of the burdens and dangers that follow it. Be careful that you are the one who directs this power, and not it you.`
	"CN-15605" `	"Know well that we have learned how to overcome it."`
	"CN-15606" `	The Quarg takes one last long look at your ship, then makes a curt farewell motion, leaving you to your business. The crowd, too, starts to disperse, with only a few staying behind to gawk at the ship.`
	"CN-15607" `	As you make your way through the ring, you notice occasional glares from the Quarg onboard the ring.`
	"CN-15608" `You've obtained the rank of Heliarch, the group who to this day remain hostile to the Quarg. Despite that, you were allowed to land here on <origin> - you don't know whether that's because the Quarg simply don't know that you've joined the Heliarchs, or don't care enough to stop you from coming to their rings. Would you like to ask the Quarg for their side of the story, in light of what you've learned from the Heliarchs?`
	"CN-15609" `You've joined the Lunarium in Coalition space, and even served as a messenger to bring the Quarg some information about the Lunarium itself, in the hopes that they might provide some help. Would you like to ask the Quarg for their side of the story, in light of what you've learned from the Lunarium and from your visit to the Quarg with Oobat?`
	"CN-15610" `	You're never quite sure who to speak with when it comes to the Quarg, but this time you're drawn to one that easily stands out. You judge it to be an older member of their species; its thin scales cover its fingers, and the more bony parts of its head have turned to a bright, silvery shade. Unlike most Quarg you've seen, it is wearing a pale, faded white robe, with patches of red-colored chains (that somehow perfectly transition into fabric again) becoming more and more prominent closer to the top, culminating in a firm, crimson hood covering its head. Most surprising of all for a Quarg, however, is the large scar taking up much of the left side of its face, completely covering where its left eye should be.`
	"CN-15611" `	It is completely static, with a lost gaze focused on the ceiling until you approach it. It doesn't squat down to meet your eye level. Instead it says nothing, simply gazing at you with its one eye, colored a bright gold.`
	"CN-15612" `	"Hello, I'm <first> <last>. What can you tell me about the Coalition?"`
	"CN-15613" `	"Hello. Is it true that the Heliarchs defeated you and stole your ringworlds?"`
	"CN-15614" `	It continues to stare at you for a while, without as much as blinking. It looks over to a bench in one of the quieter areas of the spaceport, and gestures for you to follow. As you two sit down, you notice it pauses mid-breath. After a few seconds of adjusting itself in the seat, the Quarg finally speaks up.`
	"CN-15615" `	"Those three species arose in relative rapid succession, all in close proximity, compared to how other species tend to be separated by long periods of time, and longer still their distances." Its voice, while still sharing the buzzing, deep hums you've grown to expect from the Quarg, is broken up every other word by something like a crack - or a creak - as if certain vocal cords have grown sore, with an uncomfortable sound akin to an out of tune cello mixing its way into the Quarg's words. "So large are the gaps, that one might never learn of those that came before. But, that was not the case for the three. The first of them, the Saryds, were in many ways much like us Quarg in our younger days, and we perhaps were much too lenient because of that..." It stops, and brings one hand over its head, and then the other, closing its eye as if in a sudden headache. Your eyes almost instinctively go to its scales, expecting them to change like other Quarg you've seen. But, their colors remain unaltered, the same pale gray and silver shades. A few seconds pass, and it brings down its hands back to its lap, opening its eye as it continues. "The Kimek, traumatized by the billions fallen in their famines, sought help to make sure they would never face such a crisis again, and were eager to establish friendly relations with the Saryds. The Arachi, in a way, parallel humanity's development, though they were less keen on letting their inner conflicts be made public. They were the last of the three, and upon meeting their two seniors, invested heavily in research to catch up."`
	"CN-15616" `	It pauses again, taking a look around the spaceport. It fixates on you for a bit, then on the ships landing and departing here. "In the intersecting point of their territories, we built our ringworlds. Seven thousand Earth years ago, the three species of the Coalition sought to take over those rings. After centuries... no, a millennium of fighting, we left that part of the galaxy."`
	"CN-15617" `	"Why did they decide to start attacking you and your rings?"`
	"CN-15618" `	"Even now you're more advanced than them, aren't you? How come you lost thousands of years ago, when they were weaker?"`
	"CN-15619" `	"Whatever reasons they had, whatever drove them to attack us, we cannot quite comprehend... No." It stops, not sighing or showing much emotion, its scales still showing no sign of changing. It looks at the ceiling again, then back at you. "No. You are tired of hearing this same story from us Quarg, are you not? That the foolish and young species warred for no good reason." It pauses again, contemplating its words. "That war was not the first instance where we lost a ring of ours, but never did any of us wish for any ring to be lost in the first place. With three rings there, with the living space for over three trillion Quarg being constructed, we got awfully... protective of that region, in order to prevent outside interference from causing us trouble again. Our relations with the Kimek and Arachi were a far cry from the initial success and amicability we enjoyed with the Saryds, and when an Arach ship first showed signs of technology that repaired its hull platings mid-flight, an achievement even the Saryds were yet to make, we... jumped to conclusions."`
	"CN-15620" `	"You 'jumped to conclusions'? What do you mean?"`
	"CN-15621" `	"That's all. Thank you for speaking with me."`
	"CN-15622" `	It slowly turns its head over to face you, with its eye gazing into your own. An uncomfortable minute passes at a snail's pace, as you seem to struggle keeping eye contact with the Quarg, while at the same time finding it difficult to look elsewhere.`
	"CN-15623" `	"We had gone there to protect the three species. To guide them. To observe them. We failed the latter, losing track of wisdom and reason in favor of fearing past shames. In that, our guidance became compromised, for they trusted us no longer. We were no longer seen as protectors, but as those they had to protect themselves against."`
	"CN-15624" `	"Are we so horribly powerful indeed, or is our might mere consequence of being elders in this galaxy littered with the premature deaths of other species?" it asks. "No... forgive me, I did not answer your question. We... many of our young ones and veterans alike vowed to never allow another ring to be lost. We do not kill for sport, but it has become as natural for a Quarg to defend a ring as it would be for a human to defend their family.`
	"CN-15625" `	"By the billions, defenders arose, ignoring our ways of peace, what social customs we were expected to follow, and... what you may call 'orders.' After a few centuries, those that tolerated, or were forced to tolerate the request for a ceasefire, were evacuated from the rings, and then it was only a matter of time before those of us that remained were overrun by the Coalition."`
	"CN-15626" `	It once again starts looking at the ceiling, remaining like that for a minute or so.`
	"CN-15627" `	It then turns to face you once more. "We have of course noticed that headpiece the Heliarchs have provided you with. Though you have officially joined their ranks, you are human. You are not bound to that area of space. There is no need for you to obey their orders. You do not need to ever return there. There is no need for you and us Quarg to be enemies."`
	"CN-15628" `	"Is that a threat?"`
	"CN-15629" `	"What if I do want to aid the Heliarchs?"`
	"CN-15630" `	"No. It is advice. Though you have joined them, you are still welcome at our rings, for the time being. But, the Heliarchs are a group formed and bound by their distrust and revulsion for our kind. Should you continue to follow the Heliarchs, sooner or later they are sure to put you against us, at which point I can no longer guarantee you will retain safe passage through our systems, or will be granted landing clearance on our worlds still."`
	"CN-15631" `	"Your motives are your own, but if you were captivated by your own obsessions, then I can only hope you will come to see reason before you too are lost to their path."`
	"CN-15632" `	It then turns to face you again, saying, "I am aware that you brought one from the Coalition to us, for a conversation. One belonging to a group that seeks to overthrow the Heliarchs. Do be careful, human, they might not be as technologically advanced as us Quarg, but they are very strong still, and duty-bound unlike most others. You and your allies are bound to face tremendous hardship, if you are to oppose them."`
	"CN-15633" `	"Will the Quarg help us fight the Heliarchs?"`
	"CN-15634" `	"Any tips on how to fight them?"`
	"CN-15635" `	"We agreed to that conversation, that 'interview' of yours. Beyond that, we cannot help much without provoking war, I fear. We seek not to strike fear into the hearts of those of the Coalition, we never did. It would burden your cause to have us take part in the fighting."`
	"CN-15636" `	"Do not be arrogant. Do not underestimate them. Do not take victory for granted, no matter how cornered they may seem, lest you shall be cornered yourself."`
	"CN-15637" `	You get up and are just about to leave when it says, "<first> <last>." The Quarg's gaze pierces you, its eye on the same level as your own. "Where is your home?"`
	"CN-15638" `	"I come from New Boston, on the Dirt Belt."`
	"CN-15639" `	"I come from Greenwater, in Hai space."`
	"CN-15640" `	"My ship is my home."`
	"CN-15641" `	"I don't really have a home."`
	"CN-15642" `	Your response seems to have struck something in it, as it brings one hand over its scar, glancing downwards. "A harrowing sensation, is it not?"`
	"CN-15643" `	It acknowledges your answer with the faintest of nods. "Sparse were my own visits to the rocky worlds inhabited by other species. They are unlike our own. So different, so... complete." Its eye darts around, looking at your surroundings, other Quarg here, then finally its own hands and arms. "But us Quarg must make do."`
	"CN-15644" `	After staring you down for a few seconds, it fixates upon the ceiling again. "I suppose others such as you may imagine that our own lives in our ringworlds are similar to your own within a ship or simple space station." It pauses again, for nearly a minute this time. "Considering the circumstances, that may be a reasonable conclusion on your part."`
	"CN-15645" `	It faces you again, and asks, "Have you any more questions for me, Captain?"`
	"CN-15646" `	"I am called Gohl Salyi Memt-Wrik Laz. An old Quarg. Too old for my own good."`
	"CN-15647" `	You thank it for its time, and see it get up to leave. As soon as it steps away from the bench, you notice a dozen heavily armored Quarg begin to follow it, some coming from the sides of the bench, others seemingly having materalized from the very walls and flooring. They follow Gohl in a machine-like formation, and never so much as acknowledge you.`
	"CN-15648" `	When you last glance back at it before entering your ship again, you see the distinct reflection of Gohl's eye glancing at you from a distance, before being followed by the armorclad Quarg deeper into the station.`
	"CN-15649" `"Are you what is called a 'tourist'?"`
	"CN-15650" `"Yes, human? Do you have any questions?"`
	"CN-15651" `"Hello, human. Are you enjoying your time on our world? We are glad to receive visitors."`
	"CN-15652" `"I am sorry, but we will not provide you with our technology. It is for the best that humans grow and develop on their own."`
	"CN-15653" `"It troubles me greatly to see how many species still cling to senseless fighting. I can only hope you will all come to see reason."`
	"CN-15654" `"Last year our scientific efforts were quite fruitful, but I am afraid we cannot simply share our discoveries with you."`
	"CN-15655" `"If you ever observe some piece of our technology in the possession of someone else, please report it to us. We cannot allow our equipment to be in the wrong hands."`
	"CN-15656" `"You are welcome to be amongst us here, provided you seek no conflict with anyone on our worlds."`
	"CN-15657" `There's an eerie silence as a particularly large crowd of Quarg walks by you.`
	"CN-15658" `A group of Quarg is enthralled in what seems an engaging discussion, until one more Quarg comes to them. They all turn to it, and after it says something quickly they all get up in unison and move to somewhere else in the hangars.`
	"CN-15659" `An older Quarg is playing with a much younger Quarg, young enough that it's still shorter than yourself. The strange game consists of passing to one another a jar with some slimy, metallic substance inside. Every time the jar is passed, the substance meshes itself into a different shape, sometimes into shapes you know not the meaning of.`
	"CN-15660" `Dozens of Quarg children are being led around by a handful of adults, as if on a school trip. When they notice you, they continue taking glances and talking among themselves. It seems they've never seen a human before.`
	"CN-15661" `You are immediately hailed by the Quarg in the system after they complete the scan of your ship.`
	"CN-15662" `	"<first> <last>, you are found to be in illegal possession of Quarg equipment. Our devices are precious and ours alone. Though it is regrettable, we must terminate you."`
	"CN-15663" `	They close communications before you have a chance to respond, and you look to your radar to see their ships are already approaching, weapons readied...`
	"CN-15664" `Your ship loses all power immediately upon touching down on the landing pad. As you walk around to try and find the problem, you pass by your hatch. You find that it is already opened with dozens of Quarg coming in, all clad in elegant full-body armor suits.`
	"CN-15665" `	"<first> <last>, you are found to be in illegal possession of Quarg equipment. Our devices are precious and ours alone. Though it is regrettable, we must seize you."`
	"CN-15666" `	They don't allow you to get as much as a word out before one of the guards has locked your arms behind your back, completely halting your attempts to fight back with surprisingly little effort. You are brought to something akin to a Quarg courtroom, where they lecture you for several hours on how dangerous it is for Quarg apparatuses to be stolen and used so blithely by others. At the end of it all, the jury sentences you to life imprisonment.`
	"CN-15667" `	You spend the rest of your days in the same cell, which although large and comfortable, quickly proves plain and dull. You're kept in very good health and are well-fed, but the Quarg do not allow you to leave the cell and seldom entertain your attempts at striking up a conversation. You get few visitors and can only wonder what life would've been like had you had the chance to live out all these years in freedom, the captain of a starship.`
	"CN-15668" `Although they are unusually tall and dark-skinned, the people here appear to be human. You wouldn't know it from the architecture, however: the buildings with their curved, twisted surfaces and ramifying arches look more alien than any human dwelling you have seen before.`
	"CN-15669" `	Stranger still, no one is speaking: the usual background murmur of voices that you would associate with a spaceport is absent here. Instead, the locals are communicating in a rapid and graceful sign language, their hands tracing arcs through the air almost faster than your eyes can follow.`
	"CN-15670" `	A few of them approach your ship and one of them greets you out loud, but instead of speaking he sings the words in a high, monotone chant: "Do you comprehend the ancestral tongue?"`
	"CN-15671" `	(Say, "Yes, I do.")`
	"CN-15672" `	(Try to chant, "Yes, I do.")`
	"CN-15673" `	Their expressions are inscrutable; you aren't sure if they even understood you or not. They turn away from you for a second and converse in sign language.`
	"CN-15674" `	You sing, "Yes, I do," trying to match the leader's pitch. As you do so, several of them hum notes that harmonize with you.`
	"CN-15675" `	Two of them walk up to you. One is carrying a small device that looks like a handheld scanner. The other unwraps a small foil package, pulls out a lancet, and jabs his finger with it. A dark, red drop of blood wells up. He presses his finger onto a port on the scanner, then hands you another one of the packets. "We kindly request that you identify yourself," he chants. Several of the others hum along with him.`
	"CN-15676" `	(Give them a blood sample.)`
	"CN-15677" `	(Refuse to give them a sample.)`
	"CN-15678" `	(Run back to my ship and escape from here.)`
	"CN-15679" `	You run into your airlock, slam the door shut, and blast off from the planet. Already, several of their ships are moving to intercept you. It seems that you are no longer welcome in this region of space...`
	"CN-15680" `	You try to pull away, but the man's hand snakes out and grabs you by the wrist. Before you are even able to react he jabs your finger and shoves it onto the scanner. "You are in our space," he sings. "You will abide by our rules." No longer a monotone, his song is a jarring and atonal melody.`
	"CN-15681" `	Several of them gather around the one with the scanner as if waiting to see what the results will be. As you watch them you notice that all of them, even the women, have their hair cropped short. Also, their clothing looks like nothing that has ever been in fashion at any point in human history that you know of.`
	"CN-15682" `	Finally the scanner beeps, and a yellow light flashes. You can almost feel the tension leaving the air as the crowd relaxes. "So you are pure. You are human," chants one of the women. "You are one of us."`
	"CN-15683" `	"Of course I'm human. But what are human beings doing out here?"`
	"CN-15684" `	Several of them burst into song, singing together in harmony, "We are the hidden ones. We are the Remnant. In time of great chaos to this place we came, lest all true-born humans be killed or enslaved, by those who evolved not, but unwisely were made."`
	"CN-15685" `	As they continue to sing, you begin to piece together their story. They are the descendants of people who fled to this region of space through an unstable wormhole at the peak of the first Alpha War, which means they have been here for more than half a millennium. That doesn't explain why their culture is so radically different, though.`
	"CN-15686" `	Eventually they invite you to a dinner. Their food has strange and complex flavors, not all of them pleasant, but you do your best to be polite and pretend to enjoy it all. The meal itself is generous and stretches out as your hosts consume considerably more food than you would expect for such a trim group. After the meal, they entertain you by singing songs, some of which you recognize as classical Earth music. It appears that people in this culture use sign language for day to day communication, and use their voices only for making music.`
	"CN-15687" `	When you return to your ship, you do a search on videos of historical dialects of human sign language. None of them bear even a passing resemblance to the language of these people who call themselves the Remnant.`
	"CN-15688" `As you break orbit and get ready to escape, you receive a message from <planet>. A chant comes from your speakers.`
	"CN-15689" `	"My compatriots seem to have gotten off on the wrong foot. I am Prefect Chilia of the Remnant. We established ourselves here as a bastion of humanity to survive when the rest of human space was under threat by the Alphas.`
	"CN-15690" `	"The blood test we requested is mandatory for all who come to our worlds. We will not tolerate the presence of anyone of Alpha heritage. Should you agree to the blood test and pass, we will allow you to visit our worlds in peace."`
	"CN-15691" `	"Okay, I'll take the blood test."`
	"CN-15692" `	"I'm not taking any blood test."`
	"CN-15693" `	"Then leave immediately or be eliminated. You will not be welcomed here again."`
	"CN-15694" `	"Please return to <planet>. Be on your best behavior, as there will be no third chance."`
	"CN-15695" `Your return trip is a bit more nerve-wracking. Unlike the previous time, your flight computer keeps blaring warnings that the ships escorting you are weapons-hot and locked on. As soon as you land, your ship is surrounded by soldiers with a variety of weapons, and the same man appears in the midst of them. As before, he pricks his finger, presses it to a spot on the device, then offers a still-sealed lancet to you. He begins chanting in a severe tone, "The first may be a misunderstanding, but now you know our law. Will you submit to a blood test, or be declared guilty once and for all?"`
	"CN-15696" `	(Provide the blood sample.)`
	"CN-15697" `	(Refuse and run for my ship.)`
	"CN-15698" `	As you turn to start running back to your ship, the soldiers nearby begin raising their weapons and firing at you. As you feel your body begin to liquefy under the assault of the strange energy bolts, the last thing you see is the look of pity, resignation, and confusion on the face of the man with the scanner. Probably wondering why you would decide to return if you were just going to run again. You suppose they'll never know...`
	"CN-15699" `	Eventually they invite you to a dinner. Their food has strange and complex flavors, not all of them pleasant, but you do your best to be polite and pretend to enjoy it all. After the meal, they entertain you by singing songs, some of which you recognize as classical Earth music. It appears that people in this culture use sign language for day to day communication, and use their voices only for making music.`
	"CN-15700" `You wander the <origin> spaceport feeling very lost in this strange region of space. Having flown around for a few weeks with no idea of how to get out, you wonder if you'll be stuck here forever.`
	"CN-15701" `	You sit down on a bench and think about how you're going to get out of this situation. While you think, an old woman approaches you and signs something.`
	"CN-15702" `	"Sorry, I don't understand."`
	"CN-15703" `	The old woman chuckles to herself. "You seem lost," she says. You nod. To your surprise, she doesn't sing everything she says like the other Remnant.`
	"CN-15704" `	"I'm guessing you don't know about the wormholes."`
	"CN-15705" `	"The what?"`
	"CN-15706" `	"I do, I just can't get through them."`
	"CN-15707" `	"There are red wormholes scattered around this region of space. You can only access them if you have a Key Stone on your ship, though. Don't ask me how it works, but that's how it is."`
	"CN-15708" `	"Lost your Key Stone?" she asks with another chuckle. "Or maybe your jump drive, and now you're stuck here? No problem."`
	"CN-15709" `	The woman reaches into a bag that she has with her and hands you a Quantum Key Stone. "Just put this on your ship and you can be on your way out of here."`
	"CN-15710" `	"You're just giving this to me?"`
	"CN-15711" `	She chuckles again. "No catch."`
	"CN-15712" `	The woman sits down on the bench next to you. "I was once lost in Republic space for many years after losing my Key Stone. I know what it can be like to be away from your people for that long, so I'd rather not see you share the same fate."`
	"CN-15713" `	"Thanks for the help. I'll go fit this on my ship."`
	"CN-15714" `	"How'd you get to Republic space?"`
	"CN-15715" `	You say goodbye to the woman and begin walking to your ship. "Safe travels, Captain," she sings with a big grin on her face as you walk away.`
	"CN-15716" `	"I was an adventurous spirit in my youth," she says. "One day I found my way out of the Ember Waste and back to what I learned was the rest of humanity. For years my people had hidden here believing the Alphas had killed everyone else, but I discovered that we had little to fear.`
	"CN-15717" `	"I explored the Republic for many months, learning what had happened since the Alpha Wars, but when I attempted to return to the Ember Waste to tell my people, I found that my Key Stone had been stolen at some point during my journey. I had no way to return."`
	"CN-15718" `	She lets out a long sigh. "I don't want to bore you with all the details, but I resigned myself to my new life. I met a man, had two daughters, but never lost hope of returning to my true home. One day, after my daughters had grown and my husband had passed in an accident, I decided to go on another adventure. I dusted off my old ship, and soon discovered the Hai."`
	"CN-15719" `	"The who?"`
	"CN-15720" `	"How you've become lost here without having discovered the Hai first is beyond me." She chuckles. "The Hai are a peaceful alien people north of humanity. Go looking for a purple wormhole in the uninhabited systems of the Far North. You may find your way there.`
	"CN-15721" `	"You've met the Hai?"`
	"CN-15722" `	"Well of course. How else would I have been able to return home?`
	"CN-15723" `	"To my surprise, the Hai had a large number of Quantum Key Stones." She pauses for a moment. "Might be a good idea for you to bring some of those Hai keystones here. Anyway, I was so thrilled that I didn't even ask any questions about how they had them. I bought one and flew as fast as I could back to the Ember Waste, and I've been here ever since."`
	"CN-15724" `	"How long ago was that?"`
	"CN-15725" `	"What about your daughters?"`
	"CN-15726" `	"Well I got lost when I was 17 and returned when I was 64, so perhaps some 130 years ago now that I returned." She chuckles at the surprised look on your face as you realize that she is nearly 200 years old. "Uncovering ancient alien technology is quite the blessing.`
	"CN-15727" `	"Oh, I only told them about deciding to travel the galaxy. Never told them about returning home. I made trips to see them every so often, but they both passed many decades ago now. It seems like the Republic can't quite get anyone to live past 130 years.`
	"CN-15728" `	"I really must get going, now," she says. The woman gets up to leave, but before walking away she turns to you and sings, "Safe travels, Captain," with a big grin on her face. You say goodbye to her in return and part ways.`
	"CN-15729" `In the relative quiet of this Remnant spaceport, it's unusually jarring when an alarm siren begins howling. All around you, people are rushing to get their ships into the air. Even though no one stops to explain to you what is happening, it's pretty clear that this is a planetary defense operation.`
	"CN-15730" `	(Assist the defenders.)`
	"CN-15731" `	(Stay here, and don't help them.)`
	"CN-15732" `	You remain behind on the planet. You probably just missed out on a great opportunity to earn the gratitude of the Remnant.`
	"CN-15733" `The people here are grateful for your help in fighting off the Korath raid, and they offer you a payment of <payment>. They explain to you (in song, of course; the explanation takes the form of an epic ballad) that these raids have been taking place for nearly a century.`
	"CN-15734" `	"Have you done anything to try to stop the Korath from raiding you?"`
	"CN-15735" `	"What do you think the Korath are hoping to accomplish?"`
	"CN-15736" `	"Of course not," chants one of them. "Why would we give up a good opportunity to plunder new technology?" His voice is such a perfect monotone that you can't tell whether the comment was meant facetiously or not.`
	"CN-15737" `	"Perhaps they seek new territory, or perhaps they are just innately aggressive," chants one person.`
	"CN-15738" `	"Of course," says another, "the fact that our ships dump their cargo when the raiders attack probably makes us a tempting target."`
	"CN-15739" `	A third person explains, "We do that intentionally, to keep luring them back. The technology we gain when we manage to plunder one of their ships more than outweighs the cargo we lose."`
	"CN-15740" `	While you're conversing with the group, a uniformed woman walks up and tells them something in sign language. They sign back and point to you. She says to you, "Thank you for your help. A Korath ship that came with the raiders and fled the battle is still lurking around our territory. Would you be willing to hunt it down?"`
	"CN-15741" `	"Sorry, I don't have time to help you out."`
	"CN-15742" `	"Thank you," she sings. "It keeps jumping between systems in our territory. Maybe its jump drive was damaged or something, and it cannot escape. I will spread the information that you've taken on the bounty for hunting it, so others will not risk their lives fighting it."`
	"CN-15743" `A man approaches your ship soon after you collect your latest bounty, and sings, "You have been most helpful in fighting the Korath. Would you be willing to assist us in another way?"`
	"CN-15744" `	"Sure, tell me more."`
	"CN-15745" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested in helping you out anymore."`
	"CN-15746" `	He explains that they hope to gain advance notice of future raids by setting up remote surveillance equipment in the system in the Ember Waste that is closest to Korath space. The equipment will communicate with the Remnant via something called an "entangled particle pair" that does not require a hyperspace relay network. Ironically, this is technology that the Remnant acquired by raiding the Korath decades ago.`
	"CN-15747" `	"I will mark the target system on your map," he says, "and give you the equipment necessary to deploy the surveillance satellite. Please do not deploy it while any Korath ships are watching. Our scouts encountered Palavrets, but they have crippled them enough to where they should not be a problem."`
	"CN-15748" `When you return to <planet>, the same Remnant man meets you and says that they have begun receiving data from the surveillance satellite that you deployed. "Thank you for your assistance," he sings. He pays you <payment>.`
	"CN-15749" `	"You're welcome."`
	"CN-15750" `	"You know, a great way to say 'thank you' would be to offer me a license to buy your technology."`
	"CN-15751" `	He grins, very slightly. "That is not my decision alone to make," he says, "but I will put in a word for you and see what I can do."`
	"CN-15752" `As you are walking through the spaceport, a man comes up to you and introduces himself as the manager of the local outfitter. "Greetings, outsider," he says. "I have heard many good things about you and your assistance to our people. Would you be interested in going on a quest for me?"`
	"CN-15753" `	"What kind of quest?"`
	"CN-15754" `	"Please, I assure you, this quest will be very lucrative for you.`
	"CN-15755" `	"You may have noticed the red anomalies scattered within this region of space. What you may not have known is that these are wormholes, accessible only with the possession of a Quantum Key Stone. My people highly value these Key Stones because of this, but our mines produce very few of them." The manager shows you a Key Stone that he has with him.`
	"CN-15756" `	"We have explored all of the Ember Waste, but have been unable to find any large concentrations of these stones."`
	"CN-15757" `	"You seem to be able to easily explore outside of this region. If you manage to discover a source of Key Stones outside of the Ember Waste, would you please inform me of them?"`
	"CN-15758" `	"If I find anything, I'll let you know."`
	"CN-15759" `	"No thanks. This seems like a wild goose chase to me."`
	"CN-15760" `	The outfitter manager thanks you. "We'll discuss payment once you return," he says.`
	"CN-15761" `You find the outfitter manager and tell him that you have good news. "You found another world where the stones can be mined?" he asks.`
	"CN-15762" `	"I've seen that before," you say.`
	"CN-15763" `	He looks at you with surprise. "You found another world where these stones can be mined?"`
	"CN-15764" `As you are walking through the spaceport, a man comes up to you and introduces himself as the manager of the local outfitter. He says, "I could not help but notice that you have a Key Stone that looks different from the ones from our mines. You may have noticed the red anomalies scattered within this region of space. What you may not have known is that these are wormholes, accessible only with the possession of a Quantum Key Stone. My people highly value these Key Stones because of this, but our mines produce very few of them. Have you found another world where these stones can be mined?"`
	"CN-15765" `	"Yes, in the territory of some aliens far to the north of here."`
	"CN-15766" `	"Yes, but I would prefer not to tell you where."`
	"CN-15767" `	"That is understandable," he says. "I am a businessman and I understand how valuable certain trade secrets can be. But perhaps I can interest you in a mutually profitable endeavor?"`
	"CN-15768" `	"Intriguing," he sings. "Are they aware of how valuable these stones are?" You tell him about the Hai, that they are an old species and that to them the Key Stones are just good luck charms. "Perhaps they have forgotten the true use of the Stones," says the man. "This may give us an opportunity for a mutually profitable endeavor."`
	"CN-15769" `	"Tell me more," you say.`
	"CN-15770" `	He says, "If you could fetch me a large supply of these stones, say fifty of them, I would purchase them from you for a high enough price that you would earn a tidy profit. What do you say?"`
	"CN-15771" `	"Sure, I would be glad to accept that deal."`
	"CN-15772" `	"Sorry, I'm really not interested in doing business with you Remnant folks."`
	"CN-15773" `	After a bit of haggling, he agrees to pay you six million credits in exchange for a cargo of fifty Hai "keystones." Given how cheap they are to purchase in Hai space, you will be earning a very tidy profit on the deal.`
	"CN-15774" `	"We look forward to receiving this shipment," he sings. "Just so we are clear, however: you do not need to install them on your ship - delivering them in your cargo hold will work just fine."`
	"CN-15775" `	"I can purchase outfits into my cargo bay?"`
	"CN-15776" `	"Why would you even need to specify that?"`
	"CN-15777" `	"Of course. There are several different methods available for doing so." He switches to a chant as he begins listing methods.`
	"CN-15778" `	"Firstly, our outfitter interface has a small toggle labeled 'in-cargo' that - when checked - will instruct the dockworkers to load any outfits you purchase into your cargo bay instead of installing it.`
	"CN-15779" `	"Secondly, if you do not have any ships selected in the outfitter control panel when you make a purchase, our logistics system will assign it for delivery to your cargo hold instead of scheduling an installation.`
	"CN-15780" `	"Lastly, if you have an outfit installed, just tap the 'U' key on the outfitter to request that the selected outfit be uninstalled. After removal they will be left in your cargo hold."`
	"CN-15781" `	He glances at his commlink and starts tapping at something. "We look forward to your return," he trills, before striding away still looking at his display.`
	"CN-15782" `	"What seems straightforward to you and I is not always so simple for others. I have met more than a few pilots who thought that outfits could only be transported installed on their hull." He smiles briefly at the thought before turning and heading away.`
	"CN-15783" `You visit the local outfitter and tell the manager that you have brought a shipment of "quantum keystones" to sell to him. He is overjoyed, and gladly pays you six million credits for them. You can't help noticing that based on how much the Key Stones sell for here, he will be earning even more profit than you did, even though you did nearly all the work.`
	"CN-15784" `	"You have made a valuable contribution to our people by doing this," he says. "These stones will allow more of our ships to explore the Ember Waste and discover the secrets that it holds."`
	"CN-15785" `While exploring the Hai spaceport, you notice something interesting about some of the Hai ships. Many of them appear to be decorated with a stone that looks very similar to the Quantum Key Stones found in the Ember Waste. You ask a nearby Hai what they are, and she tells you that the stones are good luck charms that many Hai use on their ships that can be purchased from any Hai outfitter.`
	"CN-15786" `	You should return to the Remnant outfitter manager to tell him about the stones in Hai space.`
	"CN-15787" `As you explore the spaceport, you meet a Remnant man wearing some sort of optical prosthesis over his eyes, a visor with several tiny cameras mounted on it. "Ah," he sings, "the outsider. Human yet not of our culture, distinct from our mindset. That is useful. Would you be willing to invest in a research project?"`
	"CN-15788" `	"Perhaps. Tell me more."`
	"CN-15789" `	"Excellent," he sings. "Centuries ago, we discovered some space-dwelling organisms elsewhere in the Waste, and undertook to study them. Certain mistakes were made, certain underestimations, and we can no longer safely approach these organisms. Would you be willing to visit their home system and collect some sensor data? I call this an investment, because I cannot pay you until I publish the results of these studies."`
	"CN-15790" `	"Yes, I'd be glad to."`
	"CN-15791" `	"Wait, that sounds super shady. Can you explain why you think it's safe for me to enter that star system, but not for you to do so?"`
	"CN-15792" `	He says, "We studied the organisms and determined that they could not possibly be sentient. Therefore we saw no moral issues with collecting, well, ah... a sample. Unexpected things happened and certain grudges have been, ah, borne against Remnant ships for centuries as a result."`
	"CN-15793" `	"Well, as long as you don't ask me to do something that will get me in similar trouble, I'll help you out."`
	"CN-15794" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested in helping you."`
	"CN-15795" `	"Are you sure?" he chants. "We could learn some incredible things."`
	"CN-15796" `	"No, I'm really not interested."`
	"CN-15797" `	"Fine, tell me what you want me to do."`
	"CN-15798" `	He sings, "Thank you. To begin with, all I ask is that you visit this star system and scan the creatures with certain special equipment that I will provide. Report back to me when you are done."`
	"CN-15799" `	"How should I find you?"`
	"CN-15800" `	"What is your name?"`
	"CN-15801" `	"Don't worry," he says, "I will find you. You are our only visitor from the outside in many decades; when you land here, it quickly becomes known."`
	"CN-15802" `	He says, "My name is..." and then performs an elaborate gesture with his hands. "Do not worry if you can not perform my name," he says, "I will seek you out when you land. You will not need to ask around for me."`
	"CN-15803" `Sure enough, soon after you land, the Remnant researcher with the optical prosthesis arrives at your ship. When he looks at the data that you collected using his special scanners, he is disappointed. He chants, "I had hoped the scanners would show us how the creatures are able to generate enough force to fly out of the gravity wells of their planets, but this tells me nothing. Perhaps it would help if you scan them more closely. Could you equip your ship with one of the scanners that are used to inspect the outfits that ships are carrying, and see if that scanner yields additional information?"`
	"CN-15804" `	"Okay, I'll install an outfit scanner and see what it can tell me."`
	"CN-15805" `	"Are you sure they won't interpret the scanner beam as an attack?"`
	"CN-15806" `	"I doubt it," he says. "It is a very low-power beam. And after all, you were not attacked just now when you scanned them with my equipment."`
	"CN-15807" `	"Wait, are you saying that you thought I might get attacked last time around, and you didn't tell me that?"`
	"CN-15808" `	He says, "It was a small enough chance that I did not see a need to worry you."`
	"CN-15809" `	"Sorry, I don't want to help with this project anymore."`
	"CN-15810" `The Remnant researcher seems disappointed that an outfit scan didn't reveal any information about the void sprites, but he is also excited about a new idea for studying them. "I found that we have several old mothballed ships suitable for exploring the upper atmosphere of a gas giant," he says. "Until I can publish my results I will not have the resources to compensate you, but I can provide you with one of our ships. Then you could land on the void sprite worlds and observe them in their natural habitat."`
	"CN-15811" `	"How much will it cost to buy one?"`
	"CN-15812" `	"You said before you cannot safely approach these organisms. How will I land on their planets in one of your ships?"`
	"CN-15813" `	"Didn't you say before that anyone entering that system in a Remnant ship gets attacked?"`
	"CN-15814" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested in helping you anymore."`
	"CN-15815" `	"Only a few million credits," he says. "Do not worry, I will provide you with one. Consider it an advance on the resources I owe you. And, just think of how much you will be doing to advance the cause of science."`
	"CN-15816" `	"Do not worry about it," he says. "These exploration craft are exceptionally fast and maneuverable. Even if you do provoke a negative reaction, you should be able to dodge any direct confrontation."`
	"CN-15817" `	"Sorry, that's more than I'm willing to commit to."`
	"CN-15818" `	"Excellent," he says. "This ship is an antique, so be careful with the shields. They are projected around the ship and are unable to adapt to new obstacles. Hard-shell shields, I believe they were called at the time of the Exodus, as opposed to the skin shields of today that fit close to the hull." He pauses and looks thoughtful, then continues. "Just make sure nothing valuable is near the hull when the shields activate - it will either be sheared in two or break the shields. And it is important to know that the pressure suit included with the ship is able to remotely activate and deactivate the shields and other ship systems."`
	"CN-15819" `	He moves to step away, then looks back at you. "My notes indicate that there is a superstition about how visiting Crataegusa in the Cardea system was considered to bring good fortune to explorers. There is no scientific reason that should be the case, but might be worth landing on it anyway."`
	"CN-15820" `You have dodged the Archon and landed on the second of the two gas giants where the void sprites live. The hull of your tiny ship creaks and groans under the high atmospheric pressure, but seems to be holding together. Its sensors pick up flocks of void sprites floating between the planet's cloud layers, presumably feeding on airborne creatures too small to detect from this range.`
	"CN-15821" `	You also observe some void sprites leaving the planet, soaring upward on thermal updrafts. As they rise, their bodies swell to several times their original size, like an aerostat balloon gaining altitude. But clearly they have another form of propulsion as well, something akin to the antigravity repulsors that human ships use to travel from a planet's surface into orbit.`
	"CN-15822" `	After collecting some atmospheric samples for good measure, you prepare to return to <planet>. Hopefully the Archon will calm down once it sees that you have not attacked or disturbed the Sprites on either of these planets.`
	"CN-15823" `The Remnant researcher is ecstatic when he sees all the data you collected. "I will begin assembling this into a research paper immediately!" he sings. "It may be months before it is published, but when it is you will be named as a co-author, and I will share the credit with you."`
	"CN-15824" `	"What do you know about the Archon that attacked me?"`
	"CN-15825" `	"I'm glad I could help you out. I'll look forward to hearing from you."`
	"CN-15826" `	He begins singing you a song about the Archons. The song says that the Archons are servants of the mysterious Drak, whom no one has seen but whom the Quarg claim to speak to and take orders from. "That's all our histories say," he sings, "but what interests me is the biological similarities between the Archons and the void sprites. We do not think the Archons are naturally evolved creatures. Perhaps their creators incorporated elements of void sprite biology into them when they were made. Or perhaps the Archons just feel an affinity with them because they are both space-faring organisms."`
	"CN-15827" `	"Well, I'll look forward to hearing the results of your research when it is done."`
	"CN-15828" `	"Do you think the Archons will continue to be angry at me?"`
	"CN-15829" `	He says, "As long as you did not harm any of the void sprites, I doubt they will bear you a permanent grudge. The Archons are thinking creatures, after all; they cannot blame you for your curiosity."`
	"CN-15830" `	You thank him for the information and tell him that you will look forward to reading the results of his study (and, getting paid for your help) once it is complete.`
	"CN-15831" `An elderly man approaches your ship and introduces himself as a local "prefect," presumably some sort of government position. In a song so elaborate that he must have composed and practiced it ahead of time, he informs you that a scientific study on the void sprites has just been published, and as the co-author you are entitled to a payment of two million credits, which he presents to you.`
	"CN-15832" `	"When your name came up in the study," he says, "I asked around and discovered that you have helped us in other ways as well. The other prefects have reached a consensus that you should be considered a valuable friend of the Remnant, and shall henceforth be given permission to purchase our ships and technology." He hands you a small cube that looks like it is made of interlocking blocks of material similar to their ships.`
	"CN-15833" `	"I'm honored. Thank you."`
	"CN-15834" `	"Is there anything else I can do to assist your people?"`
	"CN-15835" `	"I do not have anything at the moment," he says, "but I am sure other Remnant will have tasks you can help with, now that you have demonstrated your trustworthiness. We have been keeping track of you, and we are impressed with your curiosity, perseverance, and ability to survive where most would be destroyed. All three are valued characteristics among the Remnant, and thus many will welcome your assistance on their projects."`
	"CN-15836" `	As he talks, he gestures for you to walk with him towards a nearby hall. Inside, you discover that it is one of the many cafeterias that seem to be common in Remnant starports. He picks up two trays from the window and leads you to an empty table. "While you are welcome to become one of us, we suspect that you are a citizen of the galaxy - wandering hither and yon building coalitions and enmities with species and groups across the breadth of accessible space, unfettered by conventional allegiances. As such, we hope that you will continue to explore and stop by to let us know what you have found. We ask only that you keep the secret with which you are trusted and bring us word of anything that might influence humanity's long-term survival."`
	"CN-15837" `	"What secret do you want me to keep?"`
	"CN-15838" `	"I would be honored to be one of the Remnant."`
	"CN-15839" `	"While I have enjoyed my time among you, I can never stay in one place."`
	"CN-15840" `	"What constitutes 'things that influence humanity's survival'?"`
	"CN-15841" `	He takes a bite before responding. "Basically, anything that might either pose an existential threat to humanity, or anything that we might learn from and put to use to ensure humanity's survival. It might be an invading fleet of automated machines or a spaceborn plague. But it is just as possible you might find beings that we can work alongside to form strong partnerships or ancient ruins with old technology that points us towards new discoveries. The possibilities are indeed infinite."`
	"CN-15842" `	He nods, smiling. "You are not there yet, but I think you might well become one of us before too long." He takes a bite from his plate, then continues. "Keep learning, and you may well earn yourself a place among us."`
	"CN-15843" `	He nods. "Thank you for confirming our impression. We are grateful to have you with us, and look forward to hearing about your travels."`
	"CN-15844" `	He sips on a thick drink before responding. "Quite simply, the fact that we are here. To the best of our knowledge, only the Drak and the Korath know that we exist, and of those only the Korath have raided our worlds. Our intention is to be the last bastion of humanity, and we rely on secrecy to achieve that goal." He pauses for a moment to eat, then he continues. "The Alphas are a fearsome threat, but they may be the least of humanity's worries in the grand scheme of things. We strive to maintain whatever advantages we can in case any of those threats proves itself such, and one of our best tools is surprise. If no one knows we are here, we have the advantage over any that might seek to conquer or destroy us.`
	"CN-15845" `	"Of course, maintaining the secrecy of our capabilities is also very important - and the reason why you had to prove yourself before we let you purchase our ships and outfits - but it is secondary to the fundamental secrecy of our existence. Ideally, no one should know we exist. Those who do know should think of us as little more than refugees struggling to survive in a hostile environment."`
	"CN-15846" `	He waves dismissively. "I am sure you have more questions, but let us leave it there for now. Our meals await, and, well, I need to show you some things in regards to our security procedures. So finish your meal, and let's head over to <destination>."`
	"CN-15847" `Once you reach space, the prefect interrupts your normal routine. "I'm sure you've noticed that your 'license' isn't exactly a normal ID card. There's a reason for that, namely that it has extra circuitry in it and includes a couple sensors on the surface. I don't understand everything in it, but the security specialists assure me that it is incredibly resistant to being hacked or compromised."`
	"CN-15848" `	"Okay, sounds good."`
	"CN-15849" `	"How do you know what regular licenses look like?"`
	"CN-15850" `	The old man smiles. "While we might not have access to modern licenses, we do have all our old entertainment programs from before the Exodus. Some of them included details such as what licenses looked like. While things might have changed in the intervening years, licenses were historically governed by petty bureaucracy, and those are very resistant to change. So it seemed very likely that things have not changed much. And definitely not so much as to resemble ours." He seems amused, but then his smile fades.`
	"CN-15851" `	"Then again, ancestral space never designed their licenses to withstand much. They are incentivized to be not so secure, are they not? Enough money and the right connections, and licenses for anything can be acquired. These?" He holds up a Remnant license. "Not so much." He shakes his head and becomes serious. "Now, your license has a handful of connection pads on the bottom which can be connected to your ship's IFF. When you are inbound for landing, simply tap this code on the license, and the cube will verify the pattern as well as your fingerprints and a few other biometrics to ensure you are indeed living and conscious, and then transmit an encrypted code. Our IFF systems will verify the transmitted signal and respond accordingly."`
	"CN-15852" `	"That sounds thorough."`
	"CN-15853" `	"So why have I not been shot down yet?"`
	"CN-15854" `	"What is an 'IFF' system?"`
	"CN-15855" `	"You aren't familiar with IFF?" he asks, looking slightly incredulous. "IFF stands for 'Identify Friend or Foe,' and is the general name for the system that identifies your ship to those around it. It is what determines which ships should be highlighted red or orange on your system map, and provides limited movement detail to allied ships so that targeting systems can fire past you. I do not know about their current practices, but historically the Navy and most other organizations had complex methods of verifying the identify of other ships, so it is not simply a case of having your IFF state that you are a friendly."`
	"CN-15856" `	"Thanks for the explanation."`
	"CN-15857" `	"Because every system has potential failures and vulnerabilities, we ensure that people are always involved in the decision making process. Our initial scans showed that you were not likely an Alpha, and we were curious as to who you were and what opportunities might come of it. Since then the various monitors of the system have had to manually designate you as 'friendly' every time you made an approach. It worked, for a time. But now it is time to make your acceptance official. While our monitors are effective, it still wastes time to force them to track you and cancel the alerts every time you approach. Since you are trustworthy, better to give you the means to identify yourself so our defenses can focus on real threats.`
	"CN-15858" `	The prefect nods in agreement. "We take our security very seriously.`
	"CN-15859" `	"Now, before we arrive at <planet>, pick a pattern for yourself. Something short - a second or two at most, and something memorable to you." The prefect turns away from you to install a small device on the side of one of your bridge consoles, and connects a few wires into the panel. "Now, insert your license here, and tap your pattern on the license." He looks away as you follow his directions.`
	"CN-15860" `	"Done? Good. When we approach <planet>, you will have a few options: for a normal approach when everything is nominal, tap your pattern on the license. If there is a threat following you in - an enemy ship or some other kind of danger you want the monitors to watch for, pinch or squeeze the license instead. And if you have a problem onboard, such as having been captured and forced to fly the ship in, tap the license in a random pattern. Lastly, if you are having trouble landing due to injury or damage to the ship, just press briefly on the license. If you don't touch the license at all, the monitors will assume that you are either incapacitated or otherwise not in command of your ship. We will still attempt to let you land safely and provide assistance, but will also be standing ready to destroy you and block your approach if we think you are becoming a threat."`
	"CN-15861" `As you enter the upper atmosphere of <planet>, the prefect gestures toward the small bracket he installed on your console. You insert your license and tap the pattern you created. He checks his commlink and then nods. "Your license and clearance have been accepted, Captain <first>. Carry on with landing as normal."`
	"CN-15862" `	You proceed with the approach and landing, with the prefect pointing out noteworthy features along the way. He also points out various approach paths, including preferred routes to take if you are being chased. "If you have a hostile threat on your tail, take this landing corridor, which will expose trailing ships to fire from these points. And if you have something sticking tight in your shadow, do a roll at this point or that point. That will expose them to our high-precision batteries."`
	"CN-15863" `	"Thank you for the advice."`
	"CN-15864" `	"I'm surprised you are telling me all this."`
	"CN-15865" `	"Oh, do not worry that you know too much. There are far more defenses that I have not mentioned, and we are always improving them. Generally, our defenses should be invisible to you - as in, they stay out of your way."`
	"CN-15866" `	Your approach goes smoothly, and you glide past a number of anti-air batteries that are methodically covering the sky around you. Once the <ship> has settled safely to the ground, the prefect pulls the license from the socket and hands it back to you. "At the risk of sounding like a parody: keep it secret, keep it safe. May the Embers burn bright for you." And with that, the old prefect walks off your ship.`
	"CN-15867" `As you make your way through the spaceport, you become increasingly aware of how quiet it is. Looking around, you note that it doesn't seem any less busy than usual, just that only a handful of people are paying attention to you. As a result, they have reverted to their normal gestures instead of singing. It feels oddly isolating, and eerie, to realize that there are hundreds of conversations going on around you, yet you can't understand a single one.`
	"CN-15868" `	(Ask someone to teach me.)`
	"CN-15869" `	Looking around the spaceport, you eventually find someone at what looks like an information desk.`
	"CN-15870" `	"I would like to learn your sign language."`
	"CN-15871" `	(Sing a short verse about not understanding people because my hands are still.)`
	"CN-15872" `	She looks at you with a confused expression, her hands making a few quick gestures. After a moment she points at the hand scanner embedded in the desk.`
	"CN-15873" `	She looks surprised, but then recovers and sings a verse about how hands can learn, but must be cautious, and gestures at the hand scanner embedded in the desk.`
	"CN-15874" `	As you place your hand on the scanner, you feel a quick tingle as it scans your hand, then a pinprick as it extracts a drop of blood. The lady behind the desk looks at her screen. She nods, taps on the screen a few times, then retrieves a data pad from beneath the desk.`
	"CN-15875" `	She hands the pad to you, and sings a brief verse about perseverance and hope.`
	"CN-15876" `	Back on your ship you flip the pad on. The data pad appears to be loaded with a number of historic musicals and operas where the meaning of the lyrics has been replicated with gestures as subtitles. It is interspersed with what appear to be Remnant children's videos slowly explaining gestures and pausing to give you the opportunity to practice.`
	"CN-15877" `	You spend a few hours going through the lessons. It takes a while to start vaguely understanding the signs, but you eventually learn how to sign a number of basic phrases. Eventually, the pad goes black and a note pops up on the screen informing you that additional lessons are available from the director's desk on Aventine.`
	"CN-15878" `While searching for the director's desk in the Aventine spaceport, you are very conscious of all the conversations going on around you. You manage to catch a word here and there, but not enough to understand the conversations. With some trouble, you ask for directions using what you have learned, and you arrive at a similar desk in a busy plaza.`
	"CN-15879" `	It looks like the person behind the desk has been expecting you. They gesture very slowly, asking how your lessons are going using very basic signs and songs. After a few minutes of conversation, they ask you to place your hand on the scanner, which takes a sample of your blood, and then give you a data chip with more lessons.`
	"CN-15880" `	You return to your ship and begin going through the lessons. These lessons focus more on purely conversing through sign with almost no singing.`
	"CN-15881" `	Just as last time, the screen goes black and reveals a note saying that there will be a final package of lessons waiting for you on Viminal.`
	"CN-15882" `As soon as you land, you look around for someone to ask directions from. Approaching a dockhand who doesn't appear to be busy, you carefully sign, "Can you direct me to the port director?" He looks at you curiously for a moment and replies with exaggerated slowness. You thank him and head towards the spaceport following his directions.`
	"CN-15883" `	Once again the director seems to be expecting you, and has a simple conversation with you about how the flight was and how your lessons are progressing. You manage to convey that you have learned a bit, and he gives you a few tips on your rehearsed phrases before directing you to place your hand on the scanner. Once again, the scanner takes a sample of your blood.`
	"CN-15884" `	(Sign asking what the scanners are for.)`
	"CN-15885" `	(Sing a verse about my confusion of the hand scanners.)`
	"CN-15886" `	The man begins to sign, but then realizes that you don't understand much of what he is signing, so he switches to singing. "Long ago it was decided that being infiltrated by Alpha agents was a big risk, and we couldn't depend on our interstellar network to remain secure. So we implemented a policy where the first time a Remnant is granted formal access to a new planet their purity and identity is verified. Thus even if someone hacked our networks to give themselves a clean identity, they would still be caught when they started working on a new planet. We also don't broadcast that requirement on our networks, simply enforce it locally. It isn't foolproof, but it adds an additional layer of safety."`
	"CN-15887" `	You thank the man for explaining the scanners to you and accept the next set of lessons.`
	"CN-15888" `	You spend a few hours viewing some of the lessons, one of which involves watching an ancient show about a merchant captain making his way through the galaxy with an unlikely crew, re-enacted by a cast of Remnant who sing and sign their way through the dialogs with exaggerated simplicity. It is oddly familiar, but you can't quite place it. You notice that it seems to have a lot of subtext about the dangers of manipulation and government secrecy, especially surrounding genetics.`
	"CN-15889" `	Skimming through the rest of the lessons, you notice that there is a lot more here than the last two times. It may take some time to get through it all, but you should be fairly fluent if you practice over a couple of months.`
	"CN-15890" `As you make your way into the spaceport, it occurs to you that one of the information directors who gave you the instructional videos might appreciate how much you have learned over the past months of practice. You stretch your fingers and stop by the desk where you are able to have a simple conversation with the information director.`
	"CN-15891" `	"Congratulations, Captain <last>!" the director signs. "Your fluency is good enough that even those unwilling to sing with a stranger should be comfortable working with you. At this rate you will be one of us in more ways than just by blood. I look forward to seeing what results from your work with us." The director is interrupted by the arrival of other Remnant asking for something and bids you farewell with an apologetic gesture.`
	"CN-15892" `	While wandering the spaceport, you think back to the scientists from the Deep that you helped discover the Ember Waste. Given that the Remnant value their secrecy, they may be interested in knowing about this.`
	"CN-15893" `	(Find a prefect to tell.)`
	"CN-15894" `	(Don't tell the Remnant.)`
	"CN-15895" `	While wandering the spaceport, you think back to the scientists researching the wormhole in Terminus. Given that the Remnant value their secrecy, they may be interested in knowing about this.`
	"CN-15896" `	You ask one of the Remnant in the spaceport where you would be able to find a prefect, and they point you to what looks like an information desk of sorts. There you tell the attendant that you have something potentially important to discuss in regards to Remnant security. They tap a few buttons then give you directions down a hallway. You quickly find yourself in an armory where several Remnant guards are in the process of cleaning their weapons. One stands up and comes over to you.`
	"CN-15897" `	"Greetings, Captain. I am Prefect Torza. I was told you had information that could be important to our security." He takes a seat on a bench on the far side of the room from the other Remnant and gestures for you to do the same. "What do you have to tell us?"`
	"CN-15898" `	"I helped a group of scientists from the Deep to discover the Ember Waste."`
	"CN-15899" `	"A group of scientists from the Deep has discovered the Ember Waste."`
	"CN-15900" `	Torza's eyes go wide. "Why would you do this?" he asks. "Do you not understand that our secrecy is of utmost importance?"`
	"CN-15901" `	"I don't believe that they will be a threat to you."`
	"CN-15902" `	"I'm sorry, but I helped them before coming to understand this."`
	"CN-15903" `	Torza seems to relax slightly. "This is unfortunate. I cannot get angry at you for that which you did not understand. But now that you do understand, seek to not make this same mistake in the future.`
	"CN-15904" `	"What do they know?"`
	"CN-15905" `	"I helped a group of scientists who were researching the wormhole in Terminus."`
	"CN-15906" `	"I discovered that a group of scientists are researching the wormhole in Terminus."`
	"CN-15907" `	"Do they know how to enter it?" Torza asks, not sounding concerned with this new information.`
	"CN-15908" `	"No," you say. "But they know, or at least think, that it is a wormhole, and are attempting to learn how to enter it."`
	"CN-15909" `	"Well, it is unlikely that they will ever learn. The only way to stabilize the wormholes is by using a Key Stone, but I have never heard of one being found in Ancestral space. Learning what these scientists know would still be helpful, though. Would you be able to get us a copy of their findings?"`
	"CN-15910" `	"I'll try. The lead scientist told me where his office is."`
	"CN-15911" `	"I'm sorry, but I don't believe I'll be able to."`
	"CN-15912" `	"This is unfortunate," Torza responds. "But thank you for informing us about this. I do not expect anything to come of this for now, but, should anything occur, we can be more prepared than we otherwise would have been." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out. "May the Embers burn bright for you."`
	"CN-15913" `	"This is good," Torza responds. "Once you have the findings, simply return to the spaceport here and give them to the information desk. We will look over them shortly thereafter." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out. "Have a safe journey, Captain. May the Embers burn bright for you."`
	"CN-15914" `	Since you last told the Remnant about Ivan's research on the wormhole in Terminus, you have helped him to discover the Ember Waste. The Remnant may be interested in being updated on Ivan's progress.`
	"CN-15915" `	(Don't update the Remnant.)`
	"CN-15916" `	You approach a spaceport information desk and ask to see Prefect Torza, whom you spoke to the last time you informed the Remnant about the Deep researching the wormhole. Luckily, Torza is on-world at the moment, and you are told to meet him in the cafeteria. When you arrive, you find that Torza has just finished a meal and is about to leave.`
	"CN-15917" `	"Ah, Captain. I was told you were looking for me. We should find a private place to talk."`
	"CN-15918" `	You follow Torza to a similar armory as before. "Is there an update to the research on the Threshold that the Deep are doing?" he asks after sitting down.`
	"CN-15919" `	"I've helped the scientists learn how to pass through the wormhole."`
	"CN-15920" `	"The scientists have discovered how to pass through the wormhole."`
	"CN-15921" `	"Liar!" Torza yells at you while standing up from the bench. "You told us of these scientists after we had already trusted you with a license." Torza walks away from you angrily, then turns his head.`
	"CN-15922" `	"It is not a matter of them being a threat," Torza says angrily. "They may be peaceful, but whoever they tell or whoever may learn from them may not be.`
	"CN-15923" `	Torza's eyes go wide. "What do they know?"`
	"CN-15924" `	"They don't know about the Remnant, at least not yet."`
	"CN-15925" `	"They have only discovered the void sprites."`
	"CN-15926" `	"They know where the Remnant are in the Ember Waste."`
	"CN-15927" `	"They have scans of a few Remnant ships."`
	"CN-15928" `	"They have samples of some Remnant technology."`
	"CN-15929" `	"They are actively surveilling Remnant worlds."`
	"CN-15930" `	Torza seems to calm down greatly after hearing this. "This is most fortunate. We will need to work to ensure that this remains the case."`
	"CN-15931" `	Torza seems to calm down greatly after hearing this. "Then may they not anger the Archon with their curiosity, as we have."`
	"CN-15932" `	Torza pauses for a long while. "I assume it only makes sense that they would know of us after discovering the Ember Waste."`
	"CN-15933" `	Torza pauses for a long while. "These scientists knowing of our whereabouts is much more of a concern than them having scans of our ships."`
	"CN-15934" `	"And you were the one who brought it to them," Torza responds.`
	"CN-15935" `	"Yes, but what I do with your technology after buying it is none of your concern."`
	"CN-15936" `	"No, they obtain it by other means."`
	"CN-15937" `	"Yes, but it is no different than me bringing technology from the Republic to you."`
	"CN-15938" `	"No, they obtained it by other means."`
	"CN-15939" `	Torza scowls in response to this, but doesn't say anything.`
	"CN-15940" `	"What you do with our technology is very much a concern to us!" Torza yells.`
	"CN-15941" `	Torza grits his teeth. "There are no reports of missing ships or outfits, and the only visitor capable of delivering our technology is you."`
	"CN-15942" `	"How are they doing this?" Torza asks.`
	"CN-15943" `	"Surveillance devices have been placed in each of your spaceports."`
	"CN-15944" `	"I don't know. I only know that they are."`
	"CN-15945" `	Torza punches a wall in anger, then relaxes. "Thank you for telling us this. We will search for and remove these devices immediately."`
	"CN-15946" `	"Whatever methods they are using, we will discover them in due time," Torza says.`
	"CN-15947" `	Torza begins tapping on a data pad. "We must act to rectify this situation," he says calmly.`
	"CN-15948" `	"I presume that you know of the whereabouts of these scientists. Would you be able to get us a copy of their findings?"`
	"CN-15949" `	"You have brought us the information that these scientists had before. I ask that you do so again."`
	"CN-15950" `	"I'll return with their information as quickly as I can."`
	"CN-15951" `	"This is unfortunate," Torza responds. "But thank you for informing us about this. We will be on high alert to see if these scientists make any moves deeper into the Ember Waste." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out. "May the Embers burn bright for you."`
	"CN-15952" `	"This is unfortunate," Torza responds. "But thank you for informing us about this. We will be on high alert to see if these scientists make any moves deeper into the Ember Waste." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out. "We may also be keeping a closer eye on you going forward to avoid another situation like this one."`
	"CN-15953" `	"This is unfortunate," Torza responds. "Very unfortunate. We will be on high alert to see if these scientists make any moves. I at least commend you for giving what information you have to us." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out without another word.`
	"CN-15954" `	"Then perhaps the Remnant should reassess their trust placed in you," Torza responds. "We will be on high alert to see if these scientists make any moves. I at least commend you for giving what information you have to us, but know that you will be watched closely by us from now on." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out without another word.`
	"CN-15955" `	"This is good," Torza responds. "Once you have the findings, simply return to the spaceport here and give them to the information desk. We will look over them shortly thereafter." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out. "Have a safe journey, Captain. But know that we may be keeping a closer eye on you going forward to avoid another situation like this."`
	"CN-15956" `	"This is good," Torza responds. "Once you have the findings, simply return to the spaceport here and give them to the information desk. We will look over them shortly thereafter." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out without another word.`
	"CN-15957" `	"This is good," Torza responds. "Once you have the findings, simply return to the spaceport here and give them to the information desk. We will look over them shortly thereafter." Torza gets up from the bench and shows you out. "Know that you will be watched closely by us from now on, Captain. I commend you for agreeing to bring us this information, but we cannot allow another situation like this one to occur."`
	"CN-15958" `	You look up the location of Ivan's office that he gave you back when you helped him save the science drone in Terminus and find that it is in a building just outside the spaceport - just one room among many in a massive office complex. The complex looks pristine by Dirt Belt standards, but when compared to architecture you've seen elsewhere in the Deep, it is rather brutalistic.`
	"CN-15959" `	You ask a receptionist what Ivan's room number is, and he points you to a room on the twentieth floor. After taking an elevator up, you knock on the door to Ivan's office.`
	"CN-15960" `	"Who is it?" Ivan says before peeking out the blinds. "Oh! Captain <last>! Please, come in."`
	"CN-15961" `	Ivan opens the door and lets you inside. The office is cramped, the walls almost entirely obscured by filing cabinets. Ivan walks over to a desk that he barely has space to get behind, picking up a collection of papers and shoving them into the nearest cabinet. "Sorry about the mess," he says nervously. "I didn't know you were coming. Is there something I can help you with?"`
	"CN-15962" `	"I was wondering if you'd found out anything new about the anomaly in Terminus."`
	"CN-15963" `	"Do you think I could get a copy of your research on the anomaly in Terminus?"`
	"CN-15964" `	"Oh, yes. We haven't been able to do too much with what funding we have left, but we have made one important discovery." Ivan turns to one of his filing cabinets and pulls out some sort of graphic that you would guess is depicting the anomaly, but you can't make any sense of it.`
	"CN-15965" `	"One of our ideas has been that the anomaly is some sort of unstable wormhole. Reports of its existence go back to at least the times of the first Alpha War, with rumors that ships have left for Terminus to never return, presumably having entered the anomaly somehow. Now I'm not one to go off of rumors, but they certainly have to come from somewhere, so the idea was at least worth investigating.`
	"CN-15966" `	"Going under the assumption that it is a wormhole that is simply too unstable to allow a ship to pass through, we wanted to see if we could get anything at all to pass through it. What we've discovered is that given a small and smooth enough object, we can get it to disappear within the anomaly without a trace." He then pulls out a small metallic sphere about the size of a ping pong ball from one of the cabinets and dangles it from an attached wire.`
	"CN-15967" `	"Now this is only a model, but we created a number of small sensors about this size and sent them through the anomaly. We'd hoped that we could take some readings from whatever is on the other side of the anomaly, as it clearly goes somewhere, but we only ever get static coming back through the wire, followed by nothing a few minutes later. And unfortunately, whatever we send in we can't seem to pull back. The wire always snaps.`
	"CN-15968" `	"So the anomaly is clearly a wormhole. Now we just need to figure out how to get whatever we send into it to come back and how to get something the size of a ship to enter it."`
	"CN-15969" `	"Sounds like you're making good progress," you respond. "Do you think I could get a copy of your research so far?"`
	"CN-15970" `	"A copy?" Ivan looks off into space for a moment. "Well, I suppose since you helped save us from losing valuable equipment, I could make an exception for you. I typically don't share findings with those not on my research team until they're finalized. I've been burned one too many times because of that."`
	"CN-15971" `	Ivan moves to another filing cabinet and pulls out a number of folders. "This will be for your eyes only. Promise you won't share this with anyone."`
	"CN-15972" `	"I promise."`
	"CN-15973" `	"I'll try."`
	"CN-15974" `	"Funny," Ivan says with a blank expression.`
	"CN-15975" `	"Let me just get these folders digitized for you, then I can hand you a data chip with everything on it. It'll only be a few minutes."`
	"CN-15976" `	Ivan leaves the room with the folders, and when he returns, he hands you a data chip before shoving all the folders back into the filing cabinet. "Well, anything else you need?"`
	"CN-15977" `	"No. That's all I was here for," you respond. "Good luck on the rest of your work."`
	"CN-15978" `	"Thank you," Ivan says. "We might be in touch in the future. I might need your help again for this project, hopefully during a less dire situation than last time."`
	"CN-15979" `	You return to the office complex where Ivan's office is and ask the receptionist if Ivan is available, and he looks at you with confusion.`
	"CN-15980" `	You ask a receptionist what Ivan's room number is, and he looks at you with confusion.`
	"CN-15981" `	"Ivan Haataja? He moved out weeks ago. Said something about 'moving up in this world' while dragging a pallet of filing cabinets out of the building. I can look up where he is now if you need me to."`
	"CN-15982" `	"I'd appreciate that," you say.`
	"CN-15983" `	The receptionist spends a few minutes tapping away at a keyboard. "Looks like he had his office moved to... the Deep Polytechnic Institute of Valhalla?" he says with a surprised look. "Oh wow, must have gotten someone's attention in the government to be moved there. Do you need directions?"`
	"CN-15984" `	"Yes, please."`
	"CN-15985" `	"Whose attention would he have gotten, exactly?"`
	"CN-15986" `	"There are a number of officials in his line of work here, so it would be hard to say."`
	"CN-15987" `	You get directions from the receptionist and thank him for his time. It turns out that this Institute is in the heart of the university district of the spaceport city. Several planets in the Deep, Paradise Worlds, and even many near Earth have a similar university district, but the one on Valhalla is the largest of its kind in the entire Republic.`
	"CN-15988" `	As you enter the district, you note that the architecture here is much more appealing than the brutalistic style of Ivan's old office building. Each edifice consists of more curves than right angles, with a textured metallic sheen decorating its surface. Brilliant facades scatter sunlight to give the area a warm glow, as opposed to directing it right into your eyes if you happen to be standing in the wrong spot. Even among all the metallic structures, there is still a good amount of greenery: well-trimmed bushes and trees line the streets, and many of the buildings are topped with gardens.`
	"CN-15989" `	You ascend the stairs of the Institute, the massive building looming over you as you approach. Its more ancient design makes the building stand out from the rest of the district; the entrance is guarded by massive marble pillars that manage to not clash with the metallic sheen of the rest of the structures nearby. The interior is similarly lavish, with a sprawling lobby area peppered with reception areas and centered by a massive fountain.`
	"CN-15990" `	(Approach one of the receptionist desks and ask to see Ivan Haataja.)`
	"CN-15991" `	The receptionist acknowledges you with a smile and then taps away at her computer. "It looks like he's available right now," she says. "We'll let him know you're coming and have someone escort you to Doctor Haataja's office shortly."`
	"CN-15992" `	A staff member beckons you, and you follow him through what seems like endless hallways and stairwells toward your destination. The entire building seems to be as impressively decorated as the lobby, with beautiful furnishings and fine art. After some time, you finally arrive at Ivan's office. You thank the escort for bringing you here, as you surely would have been lost for hours without him, and knock on Ivan's door.`
	"CN-15993" `	Ivan opens the door with a big smile on his face. "Captain <last>! So great to see you here. Please, have a seat." He ushers you inside his office, a large room with a window wall overseeing a scenic courtyard. You sit down in a plush chair on the opposite side of a desk, leaning back to get comfortable. "I know the chairs are cozy," Ivan says with a chuckle. "Don't fall asleep on me, though."`
	"CN-15994" `	He then takes a seat on his own cushioned chair. "Welcome to my office. This is miles above what I'm used to. The discoveries we were making finally attracted the attention of the Deep government, and they immediately had my office moved from the dingy complex it used to be in to here. I have you to thank for much of that work.`
	"CN-15995" `	He then takes a seat on his own cushioned chair. "Welcome to my office. Much better than the old place, isn't it? The discoveries we were making finally attracted the attention of the Deep government, and they immediately had my office moved from the dingy complex it used to be in to here. I have you to thank for much of that work.`
	"CN-15996" `	"So. What brings you here, Captain?" he asks.`
	"CN-15997" `	"I was wondering what your research on the wormholes and alien creatures has brought up."`
	"CN-15998" `	"Could I get a copy of your research on the wormholes and alien creatures?"`
	"CN-15999" `	"Ah. Well, there's quite a bit to talk about." Ivan reclines in his chair.`
	"CN-16000" `	"As far as wormholes go, we're still trying to theorize how the wormholes in this region of space work. A wormhole in the classical sense is some aberration in the fabric of spacetime that allows for instantaneous movement between two points. You can think of it like a tunnel, where you can go one way or the other. But how then does the series of wormholes that you discovered operate? Four different wormholes somehow create a loop of unidirectional travel." Ivan turns his chair and glances out at the courtyard. "We aren't yet sure how they could be functioning this way. Anything we come up with seems to violate some law of physics that we're certain is true."`
	"CN-16001" `	Ivan turns back to you. "As for those alien creatures, they're similarly intriguing. Humanity has found life on other worlds before, but it has always conformed to our ideas of what life is, given our experience on Earth centuries ago. But these creatures are something else entirely. There are no terrestrial planets in the system you found them in which could be suitable for life, so they must have evolved on the gas giants. How life can even begin in such an environment, let alone evolve to be able to travel the vacuum of space - that is a mystery to us.`
	"CN-16002" `	"By the way, would you like to have the honor of naming these creatures? My team has some ideas, but we're not particularly convinced by any of them, so I thought I'd ask you."`
	"CN-16003" `	"How about 'void sprites'?"`
	"CN-16004" `	"How about 'Floaty McFloat Face'?"`
	"CN-16005" `	"Sorry, I don't have any ideas."`
	"CN-16006" `	"That's unfortunate," Ivan says. "I've been thinking of a name that references the void of space. I'll come up with something eventually."`
	"CN-16007" `	"In a joking mood, I see. We're not naming them 'Floaty McFloat Face,'" Ivan says with a blank expression. "I've been thinking of something in relation to the void of space. I'll come up with something eventually."`
	"CN-16008" `	"Void sprites," Ivan says slowly, as if letting the name sit on his tongue. "Void sprites... I like it."`
	"CN-16009" `	"Do you think I could get a copy of your research?" you ask.`
	"CN-16010" `	"A copy?" Ivan looks off into space for a moment. "Well, I suppose since you helped me so much, I could make an exception for you. I typically don't share findings with those not on my research team until they're finalized. I've been burned one too many times because of that."`
	"CN-16011" `	Ivan leans over to his desk. "This will be for your eyes only."`
	"CN-16012" `	"Again?" Ivan asks. He leans over to his desk. "I like that you're so interested in my research. I suppose it only makes sense with you helping me, but typically merchant captains aren't this interested in following up on odd jobs they do."`
	"CN-16013" `	He presses a button on the desk. "Abigail, could you please make a copy of the encrypted folders 'TAB-RP,' 'WLT-RP,' and 'GGA-RP' on the Institute network under my name and bring them to my office in a data chip? Thank you."`
	"CN-16014" `	"I was wondering what your research on those Remnant ship scans has brought up."`
	"CN-16015" `	"Could I get a copy of your research on those Remnant ship scans?"`
	"CN-16016" `	"The ship scans look like nothing we've ever seen before. The ships seem to have a sort of... organic property to them. Here, let me show you." Ivan pulls up a schematic on his computer of the Remnant ships that you scanned. You're somewhat surprised that he could pull so much information from an outfit scan. "The ships look relatively normal for the most part, but their hulls have an almost organic structure to them." He zooms in on a section of the schematic that highlights the hull structure. "Now, when it comes to ships designed by, say, Betelgeuse, or even the Navy, the hull supports are arranged in triangular or square sections. But these ships have a pseudo-hexagonal design to them, completely non-uniform. It almost looks like the cell structure of some plants.`
	"CN-16017" `	"Aside from the strange hull structure, they also seem to have a considerable amount of equipment integrated directly into the ships themselves. Built-in scanners and ramscoops, for example. Stuff that didn't come up on the surface of the outfit scan but that we can tell is there. The smaller of the two ships you scanned also has some sort of built-in device that we can't make any sense of. It doesn't look like any sort of device that we've seen before, but it takes up a considerable portion of the ship's structure, so it must have some purpose. We'd need to get a closer look to figure out what it is."`
	"CN-16018" `	"I was wondering what your research on Remnant technology has brought up."`
	"CN-16019" `	"Could I get a copy of your research on Remnant technology?"`
	"CN-16020" `	Ivan pulls out a schematic showing the engines you brought. "The engines you brought us are very interesting. We already mentioned to you how they're rather powerful for their size, more so than even atomic engines of a similar size, while not producing very much heat at all. Their major downside, though, seems to be the immense amount of energy they draw. The energy drain is not surprising given that they seem to be improved ion engines, but the fact that ion engines could ever become more powerful for their size than atomic engines is something spectacular. The thrusters also seem to have the ability to provide reverse thrust, making any ship with them rather maneuverable."`
	"CN-16021" `	He pulls out a schematic showing the generator. "The generator, on the other hand, wasn't all too interesting. Little more than an improved generator of the type you might find down in the Rim. Somewhat interesting in that it doesn't produce much energy when compared to something like a fusion reactor, given the energy requirement of their engines, but I suppose these people are concerned more with keeping their ships running cool than with having extra power output. Another interesting characteristic we discovered is that the generator seemed to ameliorate the effects of ionization, like that which the Hai Ion Cannons apply, much better than normal. It seemed to be an intentional aspect of the generator's design."`
	"CN-16022" `	He then pulls out a schematic showing the weapon. "And finally, the weapon you brought us. The Inhibitor Cannon is quite the technological marvel, having properties we've never seen before. Imagine a Particle Cannon, but half the size and with more range. Two Inhibitor Cannons would take up about the same amount of space as a single Particle Cannon, yet the Inhibitor Cannons would deal more damage. On top of that, the projectiles of the Inhibitor Cannons have the strange ability to slow down any ship they hit. Ships that we tested them on were unable to turn and accelerate at their normal rates."`
	"CN-16023" `	He presses a button on the desk. "Abigail, could you please make a copy of the encrypted folders 'TAB-RP' and 'RTS-RP' on the Institute network under my name and bring them to my office in a data chip? Thank you."`
	"CN-16024" `	He hesitates for a moment before pressing a button on the desk. "Abigail, could you please make a copy of the encrypted folders 'TAB-RP' and 'RTS-RP' on the Institute network under my name and bring them to my office in a data chip? Thank you.`
	"CN-16025" `	"So, not handing this off to anyone, are we?" he asks you.`
	"CN-16026" `	"Of course not."`
	"CN-16027" `	"No. Why do you ask?"`
	"CN-16028" `	"Just curious," he responds.`
	"CN-16029" `	"Good," he responds.`
	"CN-16030" `	He hesitates for a moment, looks up at you, then presses a button on the desk while still looking into your eyes. "Abigail, could you please make a copy of the encrypted folders... 'TAI-RP' on the Institute network under my name and bring them to my office in a data chip? Thank you."`
	"CN-16031" `	"So, you said you knew of the Remnant before working with me, right?" he asks you.`
	"CN-16032" `	"Yeah. Why do you ask?"`
	"CN-16033" `	"Not that I recall."`
	"CN-16034" `	"Just curious. Do you care to tell me what your relationship with them is like?"`
	"CN-16035" `	"Well I seem to recall that being what you told me. Do you care to tell me what your relationship with them is like?"`
	"CN-16036" `	"I just do odd jobs for them. Nothing official."`
	"CN-16037" `	"I'd rather not disclose that."`
	"CN-16038" `	"Interesting," he says.`
	"CN-16039" `	He reaches for a button on his desk, then pulls away from it and turns his chair toward the courtyard. "Never mind. I can't give you a copy. That research is classified."`
	"CN-16040" `	"Okay. I'll just head out then."`
	"CN-16041" `	"But I helped you with it. I really can't see it?"`
	"CN-16042" `	"No, you can't see it. Is there a problem with that?"`
	"CN-16043" `	"Yes. I need that research."`
	"CN-16044" `	"No, there's no problem. I'll just see myself out."`
	"CN-16045" `	He turns his chair back to you and stands up. "News flash, pal. I'm on to you. You asked for the research I had back before we had entered the wormhole in Terminus, and then you later told me that you'd already been through there and met these Remnant. Then, when I asked you to help me learn more about them, you said no. I think you're covering for them in some way and giving them information on what I know. Why you're doing that, I don't know, but that's what my gut says, and I've learned to trust my gut on feelings like these. Now get out of my office."`
	"CN-16046" `	"You've got me. I'll leave."`
	"CN-16047" `	"You have it all wrong, Ivan."`
	"CN-16048" `	"I said get out of my office. Or do I need to call security?" Ivan hovers his finger over the button on the desk.`
	"CN-16049" `	"Okay, okay. I'll leave."`
	"CN-16050" `	"I think you do need to call security. I'm not leaving without that research."`
	"CN-16051" `	Ivan presses down on the button. "Security. I have a guest in my office who is no longer welcome."`
	"CN-16052" `	Not even thirty seconds later, a group of security guards enter the office. "<first> <last>, you're going to need to come with us," one of them says.`
	"CN-16053" `	"I don't think so."`
	"CN-16054" `	"Well I think so," the security guard quips back, pulling a taser from his holster. The other security guards equip various equipment of their own, some of it looking lethal. "I'm going to give you one more chance to leave."`
	"CN-16055" `	"Well you're going to need to make me leave."`
	"CN-16056" `	Before you can even finish your sentence, you can already feel your muscles tensing up from the taser. You collapse, hitting your head on Ivan's desk as you go down. Before you lose consciousness from the impact, you hear Ivan yell, "Come on! Now I'm going to need to get a new desk."`
	"CN-16057" `	You eventually wake up in a cell with handcuffs on. You look around and see a security guard looking at you from outside of the cell. "Ah, you're finally awake." The guard opens the cell. "Doctor Haataja says he isn't going to be pressing charges. Right this way, please."`
	"CN-16058" `	The guard escorts you out of the cell, which was inside the security office of the Institute, near the lobby. You get some puzzled looks from those in the lobby as you're escorted by the security guard in cuffs. After bringing you outside, the guard unlocks the cuffs. "Don't cause any more trouble, now," he says.`
	"CN-16059" `	The security guards escort you out of Ivan's office, and then out of the building. Looks like the Remnant won't be getting what they were hoping for.`
	"CN-16060" `	You back out of Ivan's office with him looking at you the entire time. Looks like the Remnant won't be getting what they were hoping for.`
	"CN-16061" `	Ivan smiles, but it looks forced. "Come back any time you want. You're free to roam the Institute whenever you desire. Most of the building is closed to the public, but I can always mark you as my guest whenever you're interested in looking around."`
	"CN-16062" `	Ivan laughs as he reclines in his chair. "Screw that. You should see what I've been able to recover from those sensor cubes you placed.`
	"CN-16063" `	"I was wondering what came of those sensor cubes I placed."`
	"CN-16064" `	"Could I get a copy of what you've found from those sensor cubes?"`
	"CN-16065" `	Ivan laughs as he reclines in his chair. "Oh, it's absolutely fascinating what I've been able to find.`
	"CN-16066" `	"With a cube in each of the Remnant systems, I was able to track all of their fleet movements, and I've discovered some interesting things. For one, ships either make trips between the three systems, or they leave the cluster entirely for significant amounts of time, often for at least a month. There weren't very many ships or fleets that took shorter trips out of the cluster, say only one or two weeks in length. Seems they're sending people on rather lengthy missions.`
	"CN-16067" `	"Aside from fleet movements, the number of ships was also of note. The cubes track the number of unique ships seen, and they rarely tracked the same ship more than a handful of times. The Remnant seem to have an incredible number of ships, more than perhaps Deep Security and the Navy combined. Certainly impressive for a group consisting of only three star systems. The cubes are also able to make low quality scans of any ships in the system. While each individual scan provides less than what an outfit scan would render, given enough scans, one can get a clearer picture of the ship's composition. These ship scan results were... interesting, though. There seemed to be very few ships like the ones you scanned. Perhaps those were their most advanced ships, but the rest of what I was able to see didn't seem more powerful than your average merchant ship."`
	"CN-16068" `	"I actually lost connection to the cubes a few weeks ago now, but I'd gathered enough information already."`
	"CN-16069" `	"A copy? Of course! Of course! You're the reason I have any of this information in the first place, so you have every right to it." Ivan presses a button on his desk. "Abigail, could you please make a copy of everything on the Institute network under my name and bring it to my office in a data chip? Thank you."`
	"CN-16070" `	Only a few minutes later, there is a knock at the door. Ivan retrieves the data chip from the person who brought it, then plugs it into a computer on his desk. "Let me reencrypt these then leave the new key in the chip for you. Leaving the key right next to the lock isn't exactly the most secure thing to do, but I take it you'll be smart enough to remedy that whenever you use this. Aaaand... done." He pulls the chip from his computer and hands it to you.`
	"CN-16071" `	"Anything else?" he asks.`
	"CN-16072" `	"Thank you," Ivan says. "Come back any time you want. You're free to roam the Institute whenever you desire. Most of the building is closed to the public, but I can always mark you as my guest whenever you're interested in looking around."`
	"CN-16073" `	When you return to <origin>, you approach the information desk that Torza told you to go to. You tell the person at the desk that you're here to meet Torza. They have you wait on a bench nearby, and Torza arrives some time later. "Hello, Captain. I take it you have a copy of the findings."`
	"CN-16074" `	You hand Torza the data chip that Ivan gave you. Torza takes it and plugs it into a terminal behind the desk. He appears to read through the research rather quickly, nodding and scratching his chin at various points. "Interesting research they have done," he says. "So they understand that it is a wormhole, but still have no means of passing through to the other side." Torza removes the data chip from the terminal and pockets it. "We will keep hold of this information. For the time being we have little to fear, but I ask that you inform us if they make any further progress. May the Embers burn bright for you."`
	"CN-16075" `	You hand Torza the data chip that Ivan gave you. Torza takes it and plugs it into a terminal behind the desk. He appears to read through the research rather quickly, nodding and scratching his chin at various points. "They seem to have taken a liking to the void sprites," he says. "It is human nature to be curious, and they will be kept curious by the void sprites for a while. This buys us time." Torza removes the data chip from the terminal and pockets it. "We will keep hold of this information and keep an eye on the Threshold in case they decide to venture further into the Ember Waste. Should that occur, we will call on you. May the Embers burn bright for you."`
	"CN-16076" `	You hand Torza the data chip that Ivan gave you. Torza takes it and plugs it into a terminal behind the desk. He appears to read through the research rather quickly, nodding and scratching his chin at various points. "Impressive that you've brought us so much," he says. "This appears to be absolutely everything they know about us. While the situation is not ideal, at the very least we now know what they know and can use that to our advantage." Torza removes the data chip from the terminal and pockets it. He then pulls out what you recognize as the sensor cubes you placed on the Remnant worlds and puts them on the table. "We disabled these some time ago, but not before feeding them some junk data. And judging by this information, it worked. We will keep hold of this information and keep an eye on the Threshold in case they decide to venture into the Ember Waste. Should that occur, we will call on you. May the Embers burn bright for you."`
	"CN-16077" `	You hand Torza the data chip that Ivan gave you. Torza takes it and plugs it into a terminal behind the desk. He appears to read through the research rather quickly, nodding and scratching his chin at various points. "So, they know of some, but not all, of our technological capabilities," he says. "We can use this fog of war to our advantage, should we need to." Torza removes the data chip from the terminal and pockets it. "We will keep hold of this information and keep an eye on the Threshold in case they decide to venture further into the Ember Waste. Should that occur, we will call on you. May the Embers burn bright for you."`
	"CN-16078" `	You hand Torza the data chip that Ivan gave you. Torza takes it and plugs it into a terminal behind the desk. He appears to read through the research rather quickly with a puzzled look on his face. "There is nothing here like what you mentioned that the Deep knows. Are you sure you received the correct information?"`
	"CN-16079" `	You hand Torza the data chip that Ivan gave you. Torza takes it and plugs it into a terminal behind the desk. He appears to read through the research rather quickly with a puzzled look on his face. "This is the same information as what you brought us last time. Are you sure you received the correct information?"`
	"CN-16080" `	Torza turns the terminal to face you. You read through it and see that all the data is on the wormhole in Terminus, but it says that they are still looking for a way to pass through it. "This isn't what I asked for," you say. "He must have purposefully given me the wrong information."`
	"CN-16081" `	"Then he understands why you asked for it," Torza responds as he turns the terminal back and pockets the data chip.`
	"CN-16082" `	"No," you respond. "The lead scientist guessed correctly that I was asking for his research to give to you."`
	"CN-16083" `	Torza scratches his chin. "This is... disappointing. You've helped to place us in a scenario where a potential adversary knows much about us, but we know little about them." Torza stares at you, but doesn't appear to be angry. "Perhaps espionage is in order. But given your connections to the Deep, we will pursue such actions on our own. Should something arise in the future where we need you, we'll contact you. Until then, do not compromise our position any further. We will not take it so lightly a second time."`
	"CN-16084" `As you enter the spaceport, you notice someone across the plaza appears to have been waiting for you. A tall, solidly built woman in short-sleeved coveralls stands up from where she was sitting near the information desk. With a few quick gestures at the person behind the counter, she heads towards you with a confident stride. As she approaches, you note that the crowds of people moving around the plaza seem to be staying out of her way as if she were someone important.`
	"CN-16085" `	In contrast, she reminds you of the mechanics who maintained the textile factories back on <starting planet>. In particular, the tools at her belt and the wear marks on her clothing suggest someone who is more comfortable inside a ship access duct than behind a desk.`
	"CN-16086" `	Before you can decide if you want to avoid this person or not, she is standing in front of you, clearing her throat. "You are captain <first> <last> of the <ship>?" She asks in a lyrical chant.`
	"CN-16087" `	"That's me."`
	"CN-16088" `	"I don't know who that is."`
	"CN-16089" `	She looks at you with an inscrutable expression for a moment. "Trying to be inconspicuous is admirable. Being oblivious to the fact that you stand out like a star in empty space is not."`
	"CN-16090" `	"I have an opportunity for you, if you are interested in being helpful to the Remnant." When you express your interest she leads you over to a balcony overlooking the primary shipyards. As she leans on the railing a cold breeze makes you shiver, but she seems oblivious to it. "I am known as Taely. As a prefect among the Remnant, I am responsible for this." She gestures at the shipyards, where you can see a myriad of the Remnant's alien-looking ships in various stages of construction or repair. "The ships we have serve us well, but they are old designs. Only the Ibis is comparatively new. We need new ideas, new inspiration." She pauses, focusing briefly on a small bay where several people appear to be pulling what looks like a supercapacitor out of a Puffin.`
	"CN-16091" `As you enter the spaceport, you notice Taely across the plaza. She begins approaching you immediately, appearing to have been waiting for you. "Greetings, <first>. I hope you are not too busy as I have an opportunity for you." When you express interest, she leads you to a balcony overlooking the primary shipyards. She seems oblivious to the chilling breeze as she leans on the railing. "As you may have noticed in your time with us, many of our ships, while they do serve us well, are old designs. While we have recently made significant progress with a new concept, we still need new ideas and inspiration." She pauses, focusing briefly on a small bay where several people appear to be pulling what looks like a supercapacitor out of a Puffin.`
	"CN-16092" `	"So, what are you asking?"`
	"CN-16093" `	"What are they doing?"`
	"CN-16094" `	"Oh, those are apprentices," she trills with a touch of amusement. "They need to learn how to handle unusual tech. One of the first steps is to deal with old tech. Like salvaging an obsolete supercapacitor out of that Puffin so it can be reprocessed into something useful, and replacing it with newer integrated energy storage." She glances at you in amusement. "You've flown the Puffin, you know how old that ship is: primitive energy systems, antique 'hard-shell' shields that have to be manually raised and lowered..." She trails off into momentary silence. "Be glad that you got one that had already been refurbished prior to your visit to Nenia. At least it had modern engines and an updated sensor array."`
	"CN-16095" `	"To the point," her tone shifts to a more martial cadence. "We want to know how humanity has advanced in the past five and a half centuries. If you found us, I am sure it is only a matter of time until the Alphas, their servants, or others intent on galactic domination discover us. We need to know what sort of weapons they will be wielding, how their ships will be protected, and how fast they can travel in deep space."`
	"CN-16096" `	"Okay, I will see what I can find."`
	"CN-16097" `	"Could you elaborate on 'how fast they can travel in deep space'?"`
	"CN-16098" `	"No, I don't want to get involved in this."`
	"CN-16099" `	She considers her thoughts briefly, then chants, "How fast a ship can move through an area of deep space basically depends on how fast they can collect fuel. Ramscoops were common at the time of the exodus, and if humanity has developed better ramscoops or other means of generating fuel, these would significantly improve their speed at exploring or crossing large volumes of space."`
	"CN-16100" `	Taely nods "I will look forward to seeing what you find. In the meantime, I should get back to work." With that, she swings over the railing and climbs quickly down the wall in the direction of the shipyard, seemingly unconcerned about the height.`
	"CN-16101" `	Taely looks at you with a blank expression, then chants in a monotone voice. "If that is your choice, you are unlikely to find much of interest to do among us." With that, she vaults over the edge of the railing and drops from view. As you quickly peer over the railing, you discover that she must have caught a handhold somehow, as she is rapidly moving down the wall in a controlled fashion with ease of a spider.`
	"CN-16102" `You remember that Taely was interested in seeing examples of technology from human space. Would you like to show her your Heavy Laser?`
	"CN-16103" `	After asking a few people, you finally get directed to a bay in the shipyard where you find Taely just finishing the installation of a Thrasher Cannon in a Starling. "Greetings, <first>. I will be down in a minute." She does a few more things inside a panel, reseals the hatch, and slides down a fin to land next to you. "So, do you have something for me?"`
	"CN-16104" `	You recall that Taely is responsible for the shipyards, so you head straight there and ask the nearest mechanic. They direct you to a large hangar tucked into a cliff face, where you find her working at a terminal filled with schematics. Behind her, the room fades quickly into darkness where you can faintly make out what appears to be a large tank and a lot of whirring machinery. As you approach she looks up from her work and turns to face you. "Ah, you have returned. Do you have something new for me?"`
	"CN-16105" `	You lead her back to your ship, where you show her the Heavy Laser. "A laser cannon?" she asks. "Our records indicate that humanity had primitive laser technology at the time of the Exodus, but nothing that would be considered useful as weapons." She pauses to look down at her scanner. "And yet my scans indicate that they are capable of significant power output." She pauses for a moment before continuing, "These could be quite useful to examine more thoroughly. Please deliver two of these Heavy Lasers to a research team on <planet>."`
	"CN-16106" `As you land on a pad adjacent to the research center, a group of researchers mount some kind of weapon on a platform aimed down a firing range. The researchers retreat behind a thick barrier and press a button to activate the weapon. A flash of light erupts from the muzzle as the target downrange is cut in half. The barrel of the weapon raises into the air, and the researchers rush out onto the range with tools and devices to inspect the damage.`
	"CN-16107" `	Noticing your arrival, one of the researchers veers off and heads towards you. "So, you are the one with the samples of humanity's laser weapons?" chants the researcher. "Always interesting to see new things." He turns and waves at a Remnant standing near the edge of the landing pad with a camel hitched to a wagon.`
	"CN-16108" `	The researchers quickly unload the Heavy Lasers from your ship, and hand you a credstick with <payment>. "Thank you for bringing us something new to examine. We appreciate the breath of fresh air." With that, they quickly head off into a nearby lab, escorting their cargo of weaponry on the oddly archaic transportation.`
	"CN-16109" `You recall that Taely was interested in examining examples of technology from ancestral space. Would you like to show her the Plasma Cannons you retrieved?`
	"CN-16110" `	Aware that Taely's main area of responsibility is in the shipyards, you head straight there and have almost arrived when you are approached by another Remnant who introduces herself as one of Taely's aides. "Greetings, Captain" she trills. "Our scans picked up indications of uncatalogued human weaponry. Were you bringing it to show us?"`
	"CN-16111" `	You lead her back to your ship, where you show her the Plasma Cannon. "I have never seen weapons designed to handle such a high heat output! Is this some kind of plasma based weapon?" she asks, gesturing at a cannon. You nod, and she continues, "Intriguing. We have noticed that the Korath ships seem to run particularly hot, and have speculated that overheating them might be an effective means of disabling them. I would enjoy researching these a bit more. If you could deliver two to <planet> for us you would be well compensated."`
	"CN-16112" `As the <ship> settles onto the pad closest to the research facility, you can see a weapons specialist checking over a large cannon on a platform beneath a nearby Albatross. When he sees you starting to unload the two Plasma Cannons, he snaps the casing closed and gestures to someone out of sight. Within moments both him and an empty flatbed are there to pick up the weapons.`
	"CN-16113" `	"Thank you for your help," he says. "Our Inhibitors provide us with something of a mobility advantage against the Korath, but they aren't particularly effective at disabling them. These Plasma Cannons will open new avenues of research for us." He pauses, then continues. "I also included a bonus for you. It is a 'finder's fee,' as we always appreciate new tech."`
	"CN-16114" `	The weapons technician finishes strapping down the Plasma Cannons and makes a gesture towards you, then heads off toward the lab.`
	"CN-16115" `	The weapons technician finishes strapping down the Plasma Cannons and makes a gesture that you recognize as "farewell," then heads off toward the lab.`
	"CN-16116" `	As you watch the Remnant heading off with their new weapons to study, you cannot help but wonder what will be the result of it.`
	"CN-16117" `You recall that Taely was interested in seeing examples of new human technology, and the Catalytic Ramscoop definitely fits the criteria. Would you like to show her?`
	"CN-16118" `	After asking a few people, you finally get directed to a bay in the shipyard where you find Taely calibrating an Inhibitor Cannon on an Albatross. "Greetings, <first>. I am just finishing these calibrations." She does a few more things inside the casing, reseals the hatch, and drops to the ground on a tether. "So, did you recover something?"`
	"CN-16119" `	Remembering that she spends most of her time in the shipyard, you head straight there and almost immediately are intercepted by another Remnant who introduces herself as one of Taely's assistants. "Good day, Captain" she chants. "Our scans picked up a new form of ramscoop onboard your ship. Have you brought it for us to look at?"`
	"CN-16120" `	You lead her back to your ship, where you show her the Catalytic Ramscoop. "Interesting. This is a new design?" She asks, gesturing at the ramscoop. You nod, and she continues, "Even if it does not perform well, new perspectives on the problem could be valuable. There is a research team on <planet> that is currently working on new ramscoop designs. If you could deliver two Catalytic Ramscoops to them we could offer you <payment>."`
	"CN-16121" `As the <ship> settles onto the pad closest to the research laboratory, you can see several people exiting an adjacent hangar with a trailer pulled by a camel. They quickly approach your landing pad and wait for you to complete your shutdown routines before boarding and starting to unload the ramscoops. Once they are done one of them comes up to you and hands you your payment of <payment>. "Thank you for the delivery, Captain. We are looking forward to seeing what they have done differently."`
	"CN-16122" `You recall that Taely was interested in seeing examples of new human technology, and the electron beam certainly fits the criteria. Would you like to show her?`
	"CN-16123" `	After asking a few people, you finally get directed to a bay in the shipyard where you find Taely closing up the panel on a Thrasher Turret. "Greetings, <first>. You have good timing: I was just finishing." She reseals the hatch, and drops to the ground on a tether. "So, did you recover something?"`
	"CN-16124" `	Given what you know about Taely, you decide to skip the spaceport proper and head for the shipyard. After a frustrating half hour spent wandering around trying to find her, you finally encounter a helpful weapons tech who says they can check the weapon on Taely's behalf.`
	"CN-16125" `	You accompany her back to your ship, where she examines the electron beam. "This could be useful. Focusing energy into continuous beams has been a popular idea for centuries. It is very useful to know that they have finally managed to make it into an effective weapon. If you could deliver two electron beams to one of our testing ranges on <planet> you would be well compensated."`
	"CN-16126" `On <planet> you follow the landing instructions to arrive at a pad set next to a small complex of testing ranges and workshops. A group of technicians is just finishing the disassembly of a weapon from the test stand when you settle onto the stand, and a few minutes later they arrive to unload the electron beams from your ship. They move eagerly to secure the new weapons to their flatbed and quickly hand you your payment of <payment> before vanishing into the lab.`
	"CN-16127" `You know that Taely was interested in seeing examples of recently developed human technology, and the D94-YV Shield Generator probably fits the criteria. Would you like to show her?`
	"CN-16128" `	After asking a few people, you finally get directed to a bay in the shipyard where you find Taely applying some kind of material over a hole in a hull. "Greetings, <first>. What brings you here today?" She reseals the hatch, and drops to the ground on a tether. "Did you bring us something?"`
	"CN-16129" `	You decide that you are more likely to find her in the shipyard, so you skip the starport and head out among the ships. As you search through the yard you are soon approached by another engineer. "Well met, Captain. Taely said you may be bringing back samples of new technology from ancestral space. Do you have something to show us?"`
	"CN-16130" `	You nod in the affirmative and lead her back to your ship, where she examines the D94-YV Shield Generator. "It certainly looks impressive," she chants as she paces around the massive piece of equipment. "It will be valuable to see what our enemies might be shielded with, and maybe something we can learn from it too." She comes to a stop in front of you. "If you could deliver two of these to a lab on <planet> we could compensate you with <payment>."`
	"CN-16131" `On <planet> you follow the landing instructions to arrive at a pad set next to a large warehouse. As you complete your shutdown routine the doors slide open and a large crawler emerges, accompanied by several Remnant. They carefully unload the D94-YV Shield Generators and strap them down. As they start heading back to the warehouse one of them comes over to hand you <payment>. "Thank you for the delivery. Our team is eager to see what humanity has achieved in these past centuries."`
	"CN-16132" `You recall that Taely was interested in seeing instances of new human technology, and the S-970 Regenerator is definitely a recent development. Would you like to show her?`
	"CN-16133" `	After asking a few people, you finally get directed to a bay in the shipyard where you find Taely adjusting something on the hull that you can't quite see. "Greetings, <first>. What brings you here today?" She taps something, then hangs her tools on her belt and drops to the ground on a tether. "Did you bring us something?"`
	"CN-16134" `	Taely seems like the sort of person who spends most of their time working directly on ships, so finding people repairing ships seems the most likely place to find her. As you enter the maintenance section, you spot an engineer waiting for you. She quickly introduces herself as an engineer who works with Taely. "She was not able to be here, so she sent me to see what you have brought" chants the engineer.`
	"CN-16135" `	You nod in the agreement and lead her back to your ship, where she does a cursory scan of the S-970 Regenerator. "Hmm," she murmurs as she peers at the readings on her instrument as she waves it up and down the regenerator. "This looks like they may have found a few techniques that would be beneficial for us to study. If you could deliver two of these to a lab on <planet> we could compensate you with <payment>."`
	"CN-16136" `On <planet> you follow the landing instructions to arrive at a pad set next to a substantial facility with a large equipment bay. As you complete your shutdown routine the doors to the bay slide open and a crawler emerges, accompanied by several Remnant. They carefully unload the S-970 Regenerators and strap them down. As they start heading back into the bay, one of them comes over to hand you <payment>. "Thank you for the new outfits to study. Our team is quite interested to see what humanity has achieved since our exodus."`
	"CN-16137" `As you are walking through the spaceport, the researcher you previously assisted with the studies on the void sprites approaches you in a hustle. "We have made some new discoveries!" he exclaims in a trill. "Some of the samples that we took all those years ago are actually eggs of some kind. So the Archon must view our previous research as being disruptive to the void sprites' lifecycles.`
	"CN-16138" `	"We have been storing these eggs in a cryogenic stasis tank, so they should still be viable and intact. Well, most of them, anyway." His notes trail off on a mournful tone.`
	"CN-16139" `	"Could you return some of them to Nasqueron? According to our logs, they were found floating in the lower levels of the atmosphere, where their natural buoyancy should keep them afloat."`
	"CN-16140" `	"Sure, I would be glad to return them."`
	"CN-16141" `	"Sorry, I'm really not interested in dodging the Archon again."`
	"CN-16142" `	"Thank you. Since we are continuing to work together, I would like to introduce myself again." He takes a breath, thinks for a second, and speaks a short verse about plumage with a complex chord that sounds at once grandiose and self-deprecating. The best you can make out is that his name is "Plume."`
	"CN-16143" `	"Just remember: you will need to use a Puffin to make this delivery. If you don't still have one, there are a few in storage in Viminal." He taps on his commlink, and an assistant emerges from a nearby building with a flatbed truck. Onboard is a large collection of cocoon-like pods cradling large eggs, as well as a big spacesuit that looks more reminiscent of an ancient deep-sea diving suit than anything carried on a modern ship. "Now, remember, you need to remove the eggs from the cocoons and release them gently. Please make sure they don't hit anything on the way out."`
	"CN-16144" `Once again you have successfully dodged the Archon to land on Nasqueron. Somehow, knowing it was going to be there was both better and worse than the surprise of the first time.`
	"CN-16145" `	As the <ship> sinks through the cloud layers, you gently activate the repulsors to slow your descent to avoid startling the void sprites. A few nearby sprites descend with you, seeming to match your velocity. You slow down as you reach the altitude listed in the log of where the eggs are to be released.`
	"CN-16146" `	Setting the ship on autopilot, you walk to the back and struggle into the pressure suit. Readying the eggs in the cargo hold, you equalize pressure in the main cargo hold to the swirling clouds outside, and open the bay doors. As predicted, at this pressure level, the eggs are almost weightless, and are fairly easy to carry to the door of the ship and release.`
	"CN-16147" `	By the time you finish releasing the eggs back into the clouds, several void sprites have converged on your ship and appear to be herding the eggs away from you with gentle buffets of their wings. You take a moment to appreciate the alien beauty of these creatures before closing the hatch and purging the ship with fresh air.`
	"CN-16148" `Back on the ground, you report on how the release went. The researcher is pleased to hear that the void sprites responded to their presence. "We will give them a few weeks, then try sending another ship to monitor them. Hopefully the Archon will be pacified by this. Meet me in the alien environments lab just off the spaceport if you are interested in pursuing this."`
	"CN-16149" `Following Plume's directions, you find a lab tucked behind the main area of the spaceport, where a short walkway leads into an underground structure. Stepping inside the door you note a rack of camouflage netting positioned easily at hand. Given what you have learned of their history, it is probably a last-ditch preparation in case they need to hide the entrance from a raid.`
	"CN-16150" `	The lab itself is a microcosm of Remnant development. The structure appears to be some strange semi-organic material, and you can see an eclectic mix of familiar and unfamiliar shapes cluttering the tables. If you had to guess, you would say that this lab was the result of several different families of technology, only one of which was human.`
	"CN-16151" `	Plume and several other Remnant are at the back of the room inspecting a bunch of cocoon-like containers, similar to the ones that carried the last batch of eggs back to Nasqueron. After checking a screen he looks up and seems momentarily startled to see you.`
	"CN-16152" `	"Ah, <first>! You are just in time," Plume chants quickly, his hands unconsciously dancing in a quick series of gestures. "These eggs are ready to be delivered, this time to Slylandro. Could you drop them off like you did before?"`
	"CN-16153" `	"Yes, I would be happy to bring them home."`
	"CN-16154" `	"Sorry, I'm really not interested in risking the Archon a third time."`
	"CN-16155" `	"Thank you. Like last time, we can't pay you for this. But we are still hopeful that the Archon might let us resume our studies." He follows you out to the <ship> and helps you load the cocoons holding the eggs. Just before parting ways he asks, "Oh, could you record the void sprites this time? We would like to see the behaviors you mentioned last time."`
	"CN-16156" `As you approach Slylandro you watch the Archon like a hawk, but this time it doesn't attempt to drive you off with tridents of white energy. Cautiously you make your way to Slylandro and begin your descent.`
	"CN-16157" `	As the <ship> sinks through the cloud layers, you notice the void sprites seem to be tailing you. A few drop past you with startling speed, only to reappear from below as you approach the designated altitude. At the last minute you remember Plume's request to record them, and hit the switch to activate the recorder for the exterior cameras.`
	"CN-16158" `	Setting the ship on autopilot, you head back and suit up in the bulky pressure suit once again. Readying the eggs in the cargo hold, you equalize pressure and open the bay doors. As before, the eggs are already floating as you open the cocoons and gently carry them to the door.`
	"CN-16159" `	Almost as soon as you release the first egg, a void sprite is there, brushing against the ship to scoop the egg away into the swirling mists. By the time you return with the next one, another sprite is already waiting at the door, undulating in the eerie light. By the time the last egg is released you can see dozens of the strange creatures swarming around the collection of eggs. It occurs to you that very few humans would ever have the chance to see anything like this.`
	"CN-16160" `	After taking a moment to enjoy the view, you shut the door as gently as you can, purge the ship with fresh air, and begin the journey back to Aventine.`
	"CN-16161" `Back on Aventine, you share the recording of the void sprite's behavior with Plume. "These Sprites demonstrate considerably more communication than we originally thought. And obviously they must have communicated what you did on Nasqueron. Interesting..." Plume's excited staccato exclamations trail off as he begins to make notes on a data pad he has on hand. "Thank you for your help, we will let you know what we find out."`
	"CN-16162" `As you disembark from <ship> you almost run into Plume as he strides across the landing area. "Captain <first>, I didn't see you there!" You glance back at the bulk of your ship that you just stepped out of and look at him curiously, wondering how he could have missed seeing a spaceship land in front of him. His chant takes on a slightly apologetic tone. "I've been lost in thought thinking about everything we have discovered lately, especially the most recent recordings you made. I still have a lot to analyze, though." He pauses, looking thoughtful. "That being said, I will probably have more work for you in a week or two."`
	"CN-16163" `	Plume asks a few more questions about what you have been doing, then politely excuses himself to continue his research. "Please let me know if you uncover anything else about Nenia!" he trills to you as he departs.`
	"CN-16164" `As you step out into the icy chill of Viminal, you get a message from Taely, the engineering prefect, asking if you could meet her in the cafeteria.`
	"CN-16165" `	(Accept her invitation.)`
	"CN-16166" `	Replying that you can, you make your way through the crowds and find an empty table. Moments later Taely appears and grabs two trays from the dispenser before heading towards you. She settles down in the opposite chair with a look of exhaustion.`
	"CN-16167" `	"It is good to see you again, <first>," she sings softly. When you sign a reply she sits up, smiles, and switches to sign. "My, you are a quick learner. This is much faster." Her quick gestures are hard to follow, but the language videos seem to have focused on a practical vocabulary that has most of the words she uses.`
	"CN-16168" `	"I have not fully..." (She makes a sign that you don't understand, but seems similar to the signs for "break" and "understand.") "... the technology you retrieved for us, but we are learning much from what we have already found. Could you help us catch up with what has happened in ancestral space since our Exodus?"`
	"CN-16169" `	"Yes. What can I do to help?"`
	"CN-16170" `	"Sorry, not interested."`
	"CN-16171" `	"Excellent! According to a friend of mine who is versed in history from the war, there were rumors that a grand library was being built in the Deep to house all of human knowledge. If it exists, that would likely be where to go."`
	"CN-16172" `	"Excellent! According to a friend of mine who is versed in history from the war, there were rumors that a grand library was being built in the Deep to house all of human knowledge. If it exists..." She stops when she notices you nodding with a knowing expression. "You have already been there? Well, you certainly get around, Captain <last>. I suppose that makes things rather straightforward."`
	"CN-16173" `	"I actually already have a copy of the library's data in my ship," you respond.`
	"CN-16174" `	"Oh, that's even better," Taely trills. "Go ahead and get it."`
	"CN-16175" `	You return to your ship to get the data chip, but when you glance out the cockpit you notice that the spaceport is more animated than usual. Remnant look to be running to their ships as fast as they can when you notice that Taely is halfway up the side of your ship securing a refueling hose and charging cable. As you reach for the commlink she scrambles up to the bridge windows and quickly rattles off a series of signs at you. All you can make out is "Keep it hot, incoming!" Before you can frame a reply she has raced across your wing and leapt to the Albatross parked next to you.`
	"CN-16176" `Having acquired a copy of the archive, you gently set your ship down on Viminal hoping that this information is helpful. The port seems unusually busy, but the comm channels are quiet beyond the bare minimum to keep traffic organized.`
	"CN-16177" `	Before you have even taken the time to shut down the engines Taely is halfway up the side of your ship securing a refueling hose and charging cable. As you reach for the commlink she scrambles up to the bridge windows and quickly rattles off a series of signs at you. All you can make out is "Keep it hot, incoming!" Before you can frame a reply she has raced across your wing and leapt to the Albatross parked next to you.`
	"CN-16178" `	Looking around more carefully, you note that every ship in the port is idling with fuel lines still connected. If this were some Republic port the safety inspectors would be having a nightmare. One Starling is getting holes in its wings patched even as the crew appear to be running prep-for-flight checklists. It also looks like every ship has a guard. Something tells you that right now would be a bad time to take a walk around town.`
	"CN-16179" `	After some tense minutes of waiting, the planetary defense sirens start and the idling ships begin to ascend one by one. You quickly figure out where you are in the launch sequence and follow the stream of craft heading for orbit.`
	"CN-16180" `After having traveled clear across the galaxy, you finally arrive at the archives of human history. Upon asking a librarian where you could get a copy of the station's archives, you're surprised to have them point you to a gift shop. There you find a copy of the archives on a data card. ("The perfect gift for the budding historian in your family! Hold all of human history in the palm of your hand. On sale now for only 39.99!") Given that a cheap data card costs a fraction of a credit, it's a bit of a rip-off, but you gladly buy one to take back to Taely.`
	"CN-16181" `As some ships maintain orbital sentry positions, most ships return to their berths. Mechanics are soon swarming over the ships, and what you suppose are ambulances are waiting at the ramps to collect the injured. Farther back, flatbed tractor units wait to pick up any salvage that has been collected.`
	"CN-16182" `	Eventually a tired but pleased-looking prefect stops by your ship. He starts chanting, "Do you understand our language, or do I need to sing?" He looks relieved when you reply that you can understand most of what is said so long as he signs slowly. "Thank you for your assistance during the raid. The sensors you placed in Parca picked up the fleet coming in and gave us sufficient warning to get everyone ready."`
	"CN-16183" `	He is silent for a moment, with the air of someone who is enjoying not having to run for the first time in a while. "Oh, Taely said that you might have some historical records for us?" You hand over the copy of the archive in response, telling him that it is probably the best available. He copies the archive onto a data pad, then returns it to you alongside a credit chip with <payment> on it. "Thank you, I will make sure this gets where it needs to go. In the meantime, we could use your help in the spaceport."`
	"CN-16184" `After watching the mechanics start repairs on the <ship>, you make the short trek to the spaceport common area. People are still rushing around as ships continue to land. No wrecks so far, and judging by the scrolling arrivals displays there are still quite a few ships on approach. Looking around for someone to talk to, you spot the prefect who had just visited your ship. He notices you and comes over. "No ships lost yet," he signs harshly, "but there are a few ships that have not checked in."`
	"CN-16185" `	He shakes his head and continues, "We need to keep our medical facilities as free as possible. Could you take some of our injured to Aventine? They are stable and healthy enough for an unattended transport, and it would free up medics and space here."`
	"CN-16186" `	"I'd rather not."`
	"CN-16187" `	He looks relieved. "Thanks. I was going to have to divert one of our sentries to take them." He pauses and consults his commlink. "The medical team will have the injured settled onboard shortly, along with everything they need to ensure they arrive safely. They will probably have some fresh crew to send back with you."`
	"CN-16188" `The injured crew made for an eerily quiet jaunt from Viminal to Aventine. They didn't sing, and rarely signed. Some spent the trip mellowed out on powerful painkillers, while the few that left their rooms seem to be mostly intent on doing prescribed stretches and movements to help damaged muscles heal. Others that you check on appear to be meditating while an intravenous system feeds into their gloves. A few are interested in visiting with someone from outside the Ember Waste, but they lacked the energy to do so for long.`
	"CN-16189" `	On Aventine there are ambulances and medical staff waiting to transport the injured to longer-term medical facilities. As they depart, a fresh crew arrives to take their places.`
	"CN-16190" `When you return to Viminal, the Remnant crew members leave your ship and disperse across the tarmac to the ships they have been assigned to, each one of them signing their thanks as they leave. A few minutes after they leave your commlink beeps, notifying you that a message from the prefect has arrived:`
	"CN-16191" `	"Captain <last>! Thank you for your help in defending Viminal and transporting those wounded. I have transferred a small token of our gratitude to you. That being said, perhaps you would appreciate this a bit more: the other prefects and I have agreed to grant you access to a wider range of ships. Our capital class ships will now be available to you, including the Albatross and the Pelican. At the rate these raids are going, it is in everyone's best interests that you have access to a better warship. Please, meet us in the spaceport to further discuss the situation."`
	"CN-16192" `Walking into the cafeteria you immediately sense the buoyant mood. According to a report on the video screen, very few Remnant ships were actually lost. Furthermore, of the ships that were lost, their escape pods worked perfectly, ensuring none of the crew were killed. Groups of crew members are gathered around tables covered in food, intermingled with the ground teams that keep their ships operational. Based on the snippets you can catch, they seem to be trading stories of crack shots and clever improvisations.`
	"CN-16193" `	Taely sits over at a corner booth with the prefect who met you at the dock and a couple other mechanics, and she waves you over. "Captain <last>! So, how do you like fighting with our fleet?" asks one of the mechanics.`
	"CN-16194" `	"It seems odd to have a planetary defense fleet plundering."`
	"CN-16195" `	"It was a tough battle."`
	"CN-16196" `	"I suppose it would," chants one of them. "We need access to their tech, though. Otherwise we'll fall behind." Judging by the finality of his statement, this is held to be common knowledge among the Remnant.`
	"CN-16197" `	While you're conversing with the group, the prefect suddenly glances down at his commlink, reads a message, then looks up at you. "It appears that a Korath ship survived the raid and has destroyed a few ships without taking cargo. Could you deal with it?"`
	"CN-16198" `	"Thank you," he signs. "It is acting oddly, jumping around destroying ships instead of looting and running. If it simply looted and left we would be pleased, but now it is learning about us instead, so it has reached the end of its usefulness. Please disable it so that we can salvage parts from it." He pauses, then continues, "I doubt we'll be able to salvage the ship itself - they pack those things with soldiers - and we do not want it to be captured, even if that is possible for you. The ship and crew should remain intact, and we will salvage what we can after you have it disabled. If you salvage anything we will happily compensate you for it in the outfitter, but do not feel obliged to do so. Destroying the ship should be a last resort."`
	"CN-16199" `As you stroll across the tarmac under the great dome you spot Taely heading your way with a flatbed tractor filled with components in tow.`
	"CN-16200" `	"<first>! I'm glad I ran into you. The last raid gave us some particularly good pieces of equipment to study. Could you take these to the weapons laboratory on Caelian?"`
	"CN-16201" `	"I could do that."`
	"CN-16202" `	"I'm not interested."`
	"CN-16203" `	Taely quickly helps load the cargo onboard your ship. It doesn't appear to be actual whole items anymore, but rather pieces thereof. "They will be expecting you, but you might have to pry them out of their lab to get some help unloading. They can be a bit single-minded when they have something interesting to work on."`
	"CN-16204" `You spot the laboratory technician entering the cafeteria, and she approaches you.`
	"CN-16205" `	"Thank you for waiting. I have a shipment of parts ready for Taely, and with the recent increase in attacks she needs them sooner rather than later. Please take them to her."`
	"CN-16206" `	Outside you find a camel pulling a wagon filled with ship parts to be loaded on board the <ship>.`
	"CN-16207" `Taely meets you at the dock with a flatbed ready to offload the shipment. As you run through your shutdown routine you hit the switch for the cargo bay doors, and by the time you have gone down to the hold, Taely has half the shipment already unloaded.`
	"CN-16208" `	Her signs flick at you with a gentleness that you are slowly deciding equates to a cheerful tone. "Thank you for all the help you've provided in recovering this salvage," she says as she hands you <payment>. "I have discussed it with the other engineers, and we have decided to give you access to our salvage."`
	"CN-16209" `	She leads you over to the warehouse, scans her ID on the console, and taps a few commands. Then she scans your ID card. "There you go, I have updated your access codes," she signs cheerfully. She hands you your ID and pulls you to a door on the far side of the outfitting shop. Beyond the door is a vast room filled with outfits and weapons that clearly don't fit the same style as the other Remnant technology. You have seen most of the things here on scans and when salvaging equipment from other ships, but rarely up close.`
	"CN-16210" `	"This section of our warehouse is the salvage area. Everything in here, we have collected in sufficient quantities that it is available for general use." She nods at a rack of Korath Heat Shunts while she explains, then turns back to you.`
	"CN-16211" `	"Of course the really advanced and rare stuff is still going to the labs first, and will not be available until we have learned all we can from it." She looks around proudly. "We do not have the industrial capacity or the number of researchers to keep up with the Alphas, the Korath, and whoever else might be out there. But we are very good at figuring out what others have built and learning from it.`
	"CN-16212" `	"Any salvage or unrecognized technology gets scanned in our quarantine area for threats, then looked over to figure out if there is anything new in it. If there is, it is shipped to a lab for our researchers to dissect. Anything we have already figured out ends up in here, where a select few captains are welcome to use it as they see fit."`
	"CN-16213" `	"Threats?"`
	"CN-16214" `	"Interesting."`
	"CN-16215" `	"Yes, it is, isn't it? So many new things out there to discover and learn about.`
	"CN-16216" `	"Yes, sometimes salvage that is brought in is dangerous. A Systems Core comes with fleets of micro-bots, for instance. If they aren't de-activated properly, they keep trying to rebuild their surroundings in the form of the last ship they were configured to serve. And while it hasn't happened yet, we are worried that someday we might run into someone who builds traps into their equipment, or uses nanobots that have run amok. We have not seen any of that yet, but our science-fiction stories are filled with tales of nanotech apocalypses and things like that.`
	"CN-16217" `	"Well, I need to get back to work. That last battle put us behind schedule on our repairs. Have a good day!" With a final flourish that you think is the equivalent of an exclamation mark, Taely strides out of the outfitters, heading towards another landing bay.`
	"CN-16218" `You were just in the process of disembarking from the <ship> when a young Remnant jogs up to you. "Good day, Captain <first>. Sorry to interrupt, but we have an urgent delivery that needs to go to Torza on <destination>. Could you deliver this please?"`
	"CN-16219" `	"Yes, I can."`
	"CN-16220" `	"Sorry, not right now."`
	"CN-16221" `	"A data archive with the latest briefings and analyses. Heavily shielded and encrypted, of course, so no need to worry about it showing up on a scan. It has to get there by <date>. So, could you do it?" They hold out a small case with a data crystal visible through the window.`
	"CN-16222" `	"Thank you." They hand you the case. "Take it to <destination> by <date>. Torza will meet you there."`
	"CN-16223" `You step out of the <ship> to see a non-descript Remnant standing attentively next to the landing pad. "Captain <first>! We have been waiting for you." They lead you into a nearby bunker. Inside, a single Remnant is standing over a hologram displaying fortifications and what appear to be troops and ships moving around.`
	"CN-16224" `	"Torza, Captain <first> is here." The Remnant's gestures convey a deep sense of respect.`
	"CN-16225" `	The Remnant steps forward and accepts the case from you. The case pops open, and he slots the crystal into a spot on the display. He nods as the display pops up several confirmations of data integrity. "Well, you have certainly made many ripples since you arrived in our little corner of the galaxy." He gestures and the large display zooms in on a spot to show you walking through a spaceport outfitter. The display shifts to show you helping wounded onto your ship. The scene shifts again to show you launching the small stealth surveillance satellite. Then the table shifts back to the display of troop movements.`
	"CN-16226" `	"You have not been with us too long, but you have shown yourself to be trustworthy and eager to help." He gestures at the display. "As you can see, your actions have not gone unobserved. We have decided to amend your IFF registration as a result." He points to a set of slots next to the table similar to the ones that are installed on your ship. "Please place both your licenses in those slots, and I will confirm your side of the change."`
	"CN-16227" `	(Place my licenses in the designated spots.)`
	"CN-16228" `	"You have been watching me?"`
	"CN-16229" `	"Yes. There is very little that goes on in our worlds that is not observed by someone, and sometimes these events garner more attention than others." He looks at you. "You are one such. As a stranger among us, you were subject to much attention, although you probably did not notice most of it. Some felt it was too risky to trust you as far as we did, but the consensus was that you are worth the trust. Now," he gestures towards the console again, "place your licenses there, please."`
	"CN-16230" `	Once you do as you are told, he inserts several unique objects, which share similarities with your licenses, into slots on his side of the table and taps several controls. "You are not yet one of us, but this brings you one step closer. Your IFF signature has been updated, and our ships' databases will be updated within a day." He removes the licenses and hands yours back to you with a relieved expression. "We are a curious people, and we fully understand the search for knowledge and to learn more about one's surroundings. But we also know how important it is to maintain our secrets.`
	"CN-16231" `	"Going forward, you are now authorized to scan Remnant ships, and we encourage you to do so, although you should wait a day or two for the update to propagate through our fleet." He looks amused by something, but his serious expression returns. "Scanning each other is, after all, a valuable form of security that gives us opportunities to spot infiltrators and unknown contaminants on returning ships. Scans are uploaded to our databases for signature matching via the Quantum Entangled Communicator built into the IFF mechanism onboard your ship, and we will return information such as alien outfit identification and tactical scan readouts whenever possible to help you."`
	"CN-16232" `	He gives a tired sigh. "While I would enjoy answering a few of your questions, I should get back to supervising the operation." He gestures at the display, which has resumed showing the tactical movements of troops. "Thanks again for all your help, <first>."`
	"CN-16233" `As you relax in the cafeteria on <origin> you are approached by a young Remnant. Judging by the hand-held sensors and tools hanging off her belt, you suppose she is a researcher or an engineer.`
	"CN-16234" `	"Hello Captain <last>. My name is Dawn, and I have been spending the past few days skimming the archive you retrieved. I wanted to ask you a few questions. May I?"`
	"CN-16235" `	She slides into the chair opposite you without waiting for your reply, and pulls out a data pad. "Firstly, our histories mention how humanity met a race called the 'Quarg' and had some ongoing dialogs with them, but not much beyond that. Now here in this history that you brought us, it says that humanity has started exchanging technology with them! Is this true?" She looks at you intently. You sign negatively, and she dejectedly continues. "Could you explain about them, then?" You reply that the Quarg have allowed humanity to live near them, and that the Quarg are usually willing to answer questions, including scientific ones. You continue, elaborating that while the Quarg don't seem to mind having an innovative shipyard studying them as best it can, they don't actually share their technology with anyone.`
	"CN-16236" `	After several hours of telling her about meeting the Quarg and visiting their worlds, it finally occurs to you that it would be easy enough to take her to visit the Tarazed system.`
	"CN-16237" `	(Offer to take her there.)`
	"CN-16238" `	(Don't offer.)`
	"CN-16239" `	You offer to take her and a couple of her colleagues to see the Quarg. She eagerly accepts, although she expresses a preference for landing on the human world, so they can observe the Quarg ships from a distance, as they would rather not draw any attention to themselves. She runs out of the cafeteria after telling you they will meet you at your ship in half an hour.`
	"CN-16240" `Dawn and her colleagues are thrilled with the trip. While they had each served on Remnant ships exploring the Ember Waste or patrolling their territory, none had ever been more than a handful of jumps away from their own space. They explain that their ships were always cautious to stay far away from human space to avoid leading anyone back.`
	"CN-16241" `	It occurs to you that Dawn and her colleagues seem much less reserved than most Remnant. You aren't sure if it is because they are younger, less secretive, or if the Remnant have been holding back from you. It is also possible that you just have better opportunities to figure it out now that you can understand their signs.`
	"CN-16242" `	Upon arriving at Wayfarer they spend a considerable amount of time watching the few Quarg in evidence. However, it is easy to see that the real draw of their attention is the ships. You wave your ID across the scanner for the shipyard and take them inside to see what Tarazed Shipyards has on display.`
	"CN-16243" `	After a few minutes a sales agent meanders over to ask if there's anything he can do to help. You ask a few questions about the different ships for Dawn's benefit, listen to the sales agent repeat a few lines from the display, then politely tell him you'll just browse on your own.`
	"CN-16244" `	Almost before you are in the main hall a sales manager is at your side, inquiring as to how he can help. You can almost see the credit signs in his eyes and you suspect that scanning your license may have done a quick check of your net worth too.`
	"CN-16245" `	You ask a few leading questions about new designs and play the part of a captain with more money than brains, and the manager eagerly directs you to the large hangars near the end that house their largest and fanciest ships. After it becomes clear that he doesn't have any experience flying them you politely disentangle yourselves from him to look at the ships in peace.`
	"CN-16246" `	After an hour of browsing, the young Remnant agree to meet you back at the spaceport in an hour and take off to the outfitters.`
	"CN-16247" `Dawn and her fellow researchers show up a few minutes after you do, excitedly talking about the various things they have seen. "<first>, there is a Quarg ship taking off shortly, and we were hoping you might be able to get scans of it while it is in flight. It would be really helpful for our understanding of how they work."`
	"CN-16248" `Dawn and her compatriots eagerly pore over the readouts as they come in, then ask if you could land again to compare their scans to ones taken on the ground.`
	"CN-16249" `The Remnant researchers' attention to detail is impressive. They carefully quantify every aspect of the scans, including notes about the ship's behaviors. By the time you are on the ground again, they have amassed quite a collection of data crystals filled with analysis. You note that they are careful to ensure everything they collect is backed up in multiple places, including what appears to be a small lead lined box.`
	"CN-16250" `	Dawn does some follow-up scans of idle Quarg ships, and her fellow researchers take some time to make sure all their pictures are crisp and detailed. They let you know that they will meet you back in the spaceport bar once they are done.`
	"CN-16251" `Back in the spaceport bar you wait around for a couple hours. Just when you were about to go find them, the trio walk in looking like they had spent all day on the move, but otherwise unreadable.`
	"CN-16252" `	"Okay, I think we are ready to go. Can you take us to <planet>?"`
	"CN-16253" `Once you are back in the privacy of the <ship>, the stony reserve fades to cheerfulness as the trio are a blur of motion, chattering back and forth with their signs. Apparently this will be one of the biggest boosts to their research since the first time they salvaged the gear off a Korath raider.`
	"CN-16254" `	They eventually slow down their signs a bit and explain that up until the time the Remnant departed from ancestral space, human scanners had been unable to penetrate the outer layers of Quarg ships. One of Dawn's fellow researchers continues with the explanation.`
	"CN-16255" `	"Our historical records just have a few pictures and videos of Quarg ships, along with a basic scan that doesn't provide more than the general outline of the ship. These scans," he says while tapping the databanks, "actually picked up detailed structural layouts and even identified a number of key components. It isn't nearly enough information to be able to duplicate them, but it is enough that we can start trying to figure out how they work."`
	"CN-16256" `	Upon arriving at <planet> they quickly thank you, hand you <payment>, and run back to their offices to finish prepping their material to publish and distribute.`
	"CN-16257" `As the <ship> settles onto its designated landing pad, you see someone emerge from the nearby outfitter and quickly make their way to you. The man waits a safe distance before approaching once you cycle the hatch and disembark. "Greetings, Captain <last>," trills the Remnant, "we saw the news that the newcomer among us was tracking down an erratic Korath ship. When you came in to land, we saw on the scans that you salvaged its malfunctioning jump drive. Could we take it to study?"`
	"CN-16258" `	"Maybe later."`
	"CN-16259" `	"That would be a good use for it."`
	"CN-16260" `You have a broken jump drive that the Remnant might be interested in. Do you want to seek out someone to give it to?`
	"CN-16261" `	You find a Remnant director and inform them about the broken jump drive that you have.`
	"CN-16262" `	"Excellent!" he glances at his data pad. "There are several teams working on aspects of the jump drive, and the team with the highest priority for this one is on <planet>. I will notify them to expect you."`
	"CN-16263" `	He considers this, and sings, "If you wish. Our offer stands, whenever you choose to return."`
	"CN-16264" `When you arrive on <planet> there is a team of engineers and mechanics waiting for you, along with a flatbed freight truck. Once you open the cargo doors they quickly free the broken jump drive from its moorings and load it delicately onto their truck. The lead engineer comes over to hand you <payment>. "Thank you for salvaging this. I suspect my compatriot who spoke to you never mentioned this, but we have a fund set aside for rewarding captains who bring in rare pieces of alien technology. If you find any more of these drives, there is sure to be a research team somewhere that is willing to reward you for it."`
	"CN-16265" `	"I will keep a lookout for more."`
	"CN-16266" `	"Aren't you going to replace it with a hyperdrive?"`
	"CN-16267" `	The engineer looks at you incredulously. "You mean you were actually trying to use this drive?" He shakes his head in disbelief. "You are lucky you managed to get this far, then. It is surprising that they exist at all, so it is too much to expect them to work too. If you need a replacement drive, there are plenty available in the outfitter.`
	"CN-16268" `	"Next time you find one of these drives, just check with a starport director. They will know where it will need to go. A word of warning though; I strongly recommend not trying to use these drives - they may disappear at the most inconvenient of times, and there will not always be an outfitter on hand." He turns and heads off with the rest of the team, turning briefly to give you friendly wave as they disembark.`
	"CN-16269" `You've plundered another broken jump drive. Do you want to seek out a director to give it to?`
	"CN-16270" `	Information must flow quickly amongst the Remnant, because by the time you arrive at the director's desk she already has the information ready for you.`
	"CN-16271" `	"Greetings, newcomer," she chants. "Are you interested in turning in the broken jump drive you salvaged to our researchers?"`
	"CN-16272" `	"They will definitely appreciate new material to research. The team is located on <planet>. I will send a notification ahead so they will be expecting you."`
	"CN-16273" `As promised, there is a team of researchers waiting when you settle onto the designated landing pad. One comes over to hand you <payment> while the rest carefully unload the broken drive and start hauling it back to their lab.`
	"CN-16274" `	"Our thanks, Captain <last>. Having the remains of a drive like this will be very beneficial to our efforts." His voice cracks a bit, as if unused to being used much.`
	"CN-16275" `	"Great! I will find more."`
	"CN-16276" `	"What are you studying?"`
	"CN-16277" `	"Our previous research into jump drives determined that these drives are unsurprisingly multi-part systems. We know the outer part that we can see and handle is mostly the machinery for generating some kind of containment field or pocket. As to how it works or why it is needed..." his chant trails off and he makes a gesture you suspect may be the equivalent of a shrug. "Anyway, our team is focused on the nature of this outer system. It is our hope that, damaged as it is, its continued existence might allow us to look a little farther inside its inner workings to figure out exactly what that field does and how it is used.`
	"CN-16278" `	"Well, my compatriots finished unloading rather quickly, so I should be off. For all our sakes, I hope you find more of these for us."`
	"CN-16279" `	As you approach the director in the spaceport concourse, he looks up and waves at you. "Good timing, Captain <first>," he sings. "We have a team of researchers on <planet> who have requested a broken jump drive. Could you deliver one to them?"`
	"CN-16280" `	"I can," you respond.`
	"CN-16281" `	"Excellent. The recent discovery of these broken drives has spurred discussion and excitement in various quarters. We have had teams researching jump drives for at least a century now without a lot of success. I'm told they are rather intricate, but your finds are opening new avenues of investigation. That being said, I will notify the team on <planet> to expect you."`
	"CN-16282" `The team waiting for you on <planet> is definitely eager to begin. You barely have the hatch open before they are chivying their camel-pulled wagon up the ramp. They load the broken jump drive surprisingly quickly despite their delicate movements.`
	"CN-16283" `	"This is an exciting day, Captain <first>! Countless theories may be proven or put back into the fires of refinement based on the testing we can do with this!"`
	"CN-16284" `	"Any theories of note?"`
	"CN-16285" `	He looks thoughtful for a moment, then warbles, "As you may know, standard hyperdrives work by generating a fusion reaction and folding it into the fabric of space/time, and these folds naturally fall along the known hyperlanes. I suppose one could view those lanes as the 'crease lines' of the universe. My favorite theory is that jump drives have some additional machinery to guide the fold. That way they can dictate where the fold occurs instead of just aligning with the nearest crease. Given their increased fuel draw, it makes sense that it would take more fuel to generate a fresh fold than to reuse an existing crease.`
	"CN-16286" `	"Oh, before I forget..." he hands you <payment>. "Off to start setting up the tests." He sings half to himself as he trundles off after the wagon.`
	"CN-16287" `You head over to the director's desk to see who is in need of the next broken jump drive. The director smiles at you, looks over several messages on her screen, then clears her throat.`
	"CN-16288" `	"Your finds are very much in demand," she sings. "Could you bring this one to a team working on <planet>?"`
	"CN-16289" `	You nod in response.`
	"CN-16290" `	"Thank you. We are looking forward to seeing what comes from this."`
	"CN-16291" `As you approach your designated pad, you spot a team of researchers with unloading equipment hustling out of a nearby entrance. Once you have completed your shutdown sequence they quickly set to work unloading the drive. Once the task is complete, they pause for a moment to hand you <payment>. "Thanks for finding this," they sing in unison. "Our labs are eager to begin work on your most recent find, Captain <first>. Our thanks!"`
	"CN-16292" `	"Good luck with that."`
	"CN-16293" `	"How is your research going?"`
	"CN-16294" `	"Good, and about to get better," they sing. "We are working on various aspects of a theory that the jump drive actually disregards traditional jumping entirely, and uses the folding mechanism to put the ship itself into a pocket, while somehow triggering an opening to said pocket in the target system." One of them continues, "If this is true, it could be fairly dangerous to try activating these anywhere close to fragile things like cities or mountains, which is why they put our lab on the far side of the planet from all such things.`
	"CN-16295" `	"Well, we have a bit of a trip to get to our lab, but it should be exciting once we get there. Fare well!" With that, they head off towards a large vehicle nearby.`
	"CN-16296" `	You stop by the director's desk to report having salvaged another broken jump drive for one of their research teams. The director nods in appreciation and checks his list. "There is a new team starting a project on <planet>. Could you take it there please?"`
	"CN-16297" `	"Sure," you respond.`
	"CN-16298" `	"Much appreciated. The sooner they get it, the sooner they can start on their project. That being said, I have spoken with the other directors, and we have decided that we are getting so many requests that we will put these into the job board for you. Any time the landing scans detect one of these broken jump drives, the system will display a message on the job board listing where the next one needs to be delivered."`
	"CN-16299" `The landing pad on <planet> is tucked away just behind the spaceport. A handful of engineers have a conveyor belt already set up to offload the drive from your ship when you arrive. When you open the hatch they extend it right up the ramp, and quickly load the drive onto it. The machinery quickly whisks the drive into a nearby structure along with its escort. A couple of the engineers stop by to talk with you and hand you <payment>.`
	"CN-16300" `	"Thanks for bringing us this drive. It is a rare piece of technology for us to get our hands on."`
	"CN-16301" `	"I will leave you to it."`
	"CN-16302" `	With a pleased expression they break into song about mining the deeps for the mysteries of the sky. As best you can tell, they are trying to figure out the materials that the drive is made with, followed by experiments to replicate those materials.`
	"CN-16303" `	"Our experiments await. May your search be fruitful!" they trill as they head off.`
	"CN-16304" `As the swirls of gas close over the <ship> you wonder idly what brought you back here. This time, there is no apologetic researcher asking you to risk your life for research, or to return eggs from where they were stolen. You catch a glimpse of the Archon materializing above the clouds as it decloaks, letting you know that you're being watched, but saying nothing; for now, it is nothing more than a silent, brooding presence in the skies of Nenia. The silent depths of an alien world fold over you, gradually erasing the rest of the galaxy from sight.`
	"CN-16305" `	As the <ship> levels off at the designated altitude, you strap yourself into a pressure suit. Stepping into the airlock, you grimace at the antiquity of these "hard-shell" shield systems, and lower the shields so that you can exit onto the hull. Out on the surface, you admire the misty kaleidoscope of colors filtering down through the cloud layers, playing over distant shapes moving in the mists.`
	"CN-16306" `	Before long several void sprites emerge, weaving and dancing among the clouds. They swirl for a few minutes around your cargo bay doors as if waiting for something, then pulse briefly with flickers of light and drop into the clouds below. Another void sprite flutters around the <ship>, poking at the hull and sliding over it with its tentacles. You quickly think to turn on your video recorder to catch the scene. The void sprite notices your brief movement, and turns towards you with a lunge. As it closes on you, your attention is drawn to what you suspect is its mouth: a zig-zagging crack that peels open like a zipper to reveal an opening that resembles an industrial grinder.`
	"CN-16307" `	Up close, the void sprite is massive. Most of its tentacles are easily as thick as your leg, and move with surprising speed and precision. It shifts through the air like a strange deep-sea fish in water. You can make out a low vibration you suspect is from the air whistling over the void sprite as it closes with you. As the giant creature rapidly approaches, you can feel a heavy paralysis weigh down on you. Suddenly, you recall that your shields are keyed to your equipment; you could activate them to protect yourself and they would extend around you. It probably wouldn't be too healthy for the void sprite, though.`
	"CN-16308" `	(Activate the shields.)`
	"CN-16309" `	(Do not activate the shields.)`
	"CN-16310" `	You push against the paralysis and trigger the shields in a rush. The millisecond that follows feels like an eternity. The void sprite is just a few meters away, one tendril reaches out and touches you just as the shield slams into place. The tendril becomes caught on both sides of the shield, cleaving it in two. In the same instant, the pressure on your mind vanishes as if it was simply a dream. You momentarily stare at the immobile void sprite, frozen in shock over what just happened. Then time reasserts itself and the sprite spasms away from the ship with an unearthly crescendo of dissonant tones. It plunges down into the clouds, leaving you standing on your hull with the floating severed piece of tendril.`
	"CN-16311" `	You carefully scoop up the tendril in a container and seal it. While the attack spoiled the beautiful moment, at least you have a sample and some recordings that might be of interest to Plume.`
	"CN-16312" `	The feeling of paralysis leaves your body as the void sprite is only a few meters away, but you resolve yourself to face down the creature without triggering your shields. Time seems to slow down as the sprite rushes up to you and its leading tentacle reaches out to touch you. As you brace for an impact you realize that the sprite has managed to bring itself to a complete stop and the tentacle has telescoped in on itself slightly. You can see that it is touching you, but you didn't even feel the impact. You and the void sprite stand frozen for a moment, and the force trying to paralyze you snaps off, replaced by a feeling of weightlessness. Moments later the void sprite pulls back and pulses skyward with an unearthly fountain of sounds, spiraling around the <ship> before disappearing into the swirling clouds.`
	"CN-16313" `	As you re-enter the ship, you notice that your suit is covered in some kind of translucent slime. You scrape off as much as you can into a sealed container, but your pressure suit appears to be permanently stained an iridescent purplish color as a result. You resolve to go find Plume, since he will almost certainly find this interesting.`
	"CN-16314" `When you walk into Plume's lab on Aventine, you find him buried in some kind of holographic projection of your egg returning mission. You can see that he appears to be watching the video in slow-motion as he taps out notes on his data pad. After a few minutes he looks up and sees you standing in the entryway. He quickly pulls himself out of the projection and hits what you assume must be the pause button.`
	"CN-16315" `	"Captain <first>! What a pleasant surprise," he trills. "If you are looking for more work, I don't have anything for you right now."`
	"CN-16316" `	You tell Plume about how you visited Nenia and had an interesting encounter with a void sprite, and offer him the recording and container of slime. He eagerly accepts the data chip and the container from you. Sliding the container into some kind of machine, it immediately starts to whir as he slots the data chip into his console. Moments later his holographic projection shifts to the new footage. He checks the timestamps, then chants, "These will take me a little while to analyze. I will meet you in the spaceport in a few hours to discuss my preliminary findings."`
	"CN-16317" `	You tell Plume about how you visited Nenia and had a threatening encounter with a void sprite, and offer him the recording and container with the tentacle. Plume recoils from you in disgust. "After all our work rebuilding trust with the Archon and the void sprites, you go and risk it for... what, exactly? Sightseeing? Thrill of the hunt?" His chant settles into an angry tone. "Leave the recording on the console. I want no part of that tentacle, though."`
	"CN-16318" `	As you are leaving Plume's lab a technician pulls you aside. "Our records mention that the tentacles had some interesting properties that were useful in combat. If you are interested, meet me in the spaceport in a few hours."`
	"CN-16319" `When Plume finally arrives you can tell from his step that he is excited. He slides onto the bench opposite to you and pulls out a data pad. "I admire your bravery, Captain. I don't think I would have had the courage to hold my ground against a void sprite like that," he chants respectfully, then changes tone to one of wonder. "In that last moment it almost looked like it was sizing you up or examining you." He shakes his head with an amused expression. "I spend so much time studying non-human creatures I sometimes slip and start anthropomorphizing them." His voice takes on a more militant cadence. "That was probably some kind of territorial display, or possibly some kind of dominance challenge. We don't know enough about void sprite behavior to speculate further, though.`
	"CN-16320" `	"Be that as it may be, the more immediate reward for your curiosity is in this sample," he trills with excitement. "Several of our labs on Viminal have been working on the development of a new generation of ship technology, and this substance contains some chemicals that could be a key component. I have already transmitted the data to them, but they would like to compare with the original. Could you take this sample to them?"`
	"CN-16321" `	"I would rather not."`
	"CN-16322" `	Plume stoically accepts that with a nod. "That is your choice. I will arrange for another ship to transport it."`
	"CN-16323" `When you land on Viminal a solidly built female Remnant in coveralls is waiting for you. "Greetings, Captain <first>. My name is Taely, and I am a Prefect among the Remnant. Above all else, I study motion, and in particular how our starships move."`
	"CN-16324" `	When you land on Viminal you spot Taely waiting for you. "Greetings, Captain <first>. It is good to see you again."`
	"CN-16325" `	She makes a gesture you are starting to recognize as a sign of curiosity. "So, Plume sent us some very interesting data, along with a message to expect you with a sample?" You hand her the container with the slime sample and she holds it up to the light. "Interesting looking substance," she chants. "Let's go back to my workshop."`
	"CN-16326" `	"Okay, let's go."`
	"CN-16327" `	"Could I catch up with you in a minute?"`
	"CN-16328" `	"Sure, just don't take too long. My project has reached its final stage."`
	"CN-16329" `	You take your time to get to the workshop, admiring the view along the way. When you finally arrive at the workshop you can hear strange noises coming from inside, accompanied by the smell of a thunderstorm in a swamp. You step into the workshop and come to a stop to stare at the thing in front of you.`
	"CN-16330" `	She leads the way through several side passages to an out-of-the-way landing pad connected to a large hangar. Inside, you can see a giant tank filled with a murky fluid, surrounded by equipment and displays. She makes her way over to a large machine with several slots which she slides the container into.`
	"CN-16331" `	As the machine starts to work, she turns back to you. "As the primary example of space-faring life, the void sprites have always been of interest to me. They have numerous advantages that we as atmosphere-bound creatures can only dream of, such as being able to experience space in a much more direct manner. I have been working on a side project to build a new generation of ships that melds these ideas with our current technology, but the data we have on the void sprites is centuries old and incomplete." Her chant trails off as she pulls up a display with your original scans on them. "However, your recent explorations provided new data I could use to update my designs. This slime that you retrieved is the final ingredient."`
	"CN-16332" `	"So my data is helping to develop new technology?"`
	"CN-16333" `	"That's good. Any chance of a bonus for me?"`
	"CN-16334" `	The machine dings, and she looks over the results and then trills excitedly. "Yes, it matches! So it is time to begin the final activation." She strides over to a central console and taps in a series of commands, followed by an iris scan and a blood prick. The industrial hum of the room suddenly ramps up to a crescendo as your nose is assaulted by what you can only describe as the smell of a thunderstorm in a swamp. A few seconds later the noise softens, and the tank starts lowering into the floor as a shape emerges from the liquid.`
	"CN-16335" `	The ship before you has some faint traces of the Puffin you have flown to Nenia, along with other elements of Remnant design, but it is clearly something new. Its antennae swivel around, as if taking in its environment, and the tentacles along the side twitch and reach out to touch its surroundings. Solidly built tendrils underneath it flex as it lifts itself off its supports and begins to move around. You have a momentary vision of what this ship might look like in the skies of Nenia.`
	"CN-16336" `	Taely's droning chant of technical details finally seeps through your reverie: "... so from a captain's point of view flying the Penguin should be very similar to a normal ship, except she flies herself and doesn't need a crew to run her systems." She pauses, and looks at you. "Your curiosity provided the final ingredients to bring her to life. You should be the first to have one." She pats the nose of the Penguin and it makes a whooshing noise. "I call her the 'Shadow Hope,' but you can rename her whatever you like." After a moment she starts going over the ship with a scanner, leaving you to contemplate in silence.`
	"CN-16337" `When the technician arrives in the spaceport he immediately strides over to you. "I checked the records, and my memory was correct. One of our research teams centuries ago discovered that these tentacles could be used as a devastating weapon in close quarters combat."`
	"CN-16338" `	He pulls out an image of a strange-looking rifle and continues to chant, "The personal weapons lab under Prefect Chilia has a few of the old weapon frames. If you go visit it on Aventine, they could turn this tentacle into a potent weapon for you."`
	"CN-16339" `	"That sounds good."`
	"CN-16340" `	The technician looks disappointed. "Oh well, enjoy your trophy."`
	"CN-16341" `You follow the directions provided to you and eventually find yourself at a Remnant weapons lab. You enter and are met by security, who asks you to wait. A few minutes later a fit young man emerges from another door. "Greetings, Captain <first>," he sings. "I am Prefect Chilia. I have the nominal responsibility for the overall defense of Remnant space and military operations." He smiles deprecatingly. "I say 'nominal' as virtually all our activities are militaristic in some way, but usually fall under the purview of those who better understand them."`
	"CN-16342" `You follow the directions provided to you and eventually find yourself at a Remnant weapons lab. You enter and are met by security, who asks you to wait. A few minutes later a fit young man emerges from another door. "Greetings, captain <first>," he sings. "We meet once again." You immediately recognize the voice as being the man who convinced you to provide the blood sample and get to know the Remnant. "We didn't get a proper introduction last time, but you have probably figured out that I have the nominal responsibility for the overall defense of Remnant space and military operations." He smiles deprecatingly, "I say 'nominal' as virtually all our activities are military in some way, but usually fall under the purview of those who better understand them."`
	"CN-16343" `	He leads you to a room that looks like an armory where a team of technicians is putting the finishing touches on a rifle stock. "The request from the technician on your behalf caught my attention, as we have not had the key resources for making Void Rifles in centuries. Fortunately, we have not really needed them since we resolved the threats that originally plagued our settlements."`
	"CN-16344" `	"It's called a 'Void Rifle'?"`
	"CN-16345" `	"I don't need details."`
	"CN-16346" `	"Yes, Void Rifle. I don't know who discovered it, but someone figured out that if a particularly high charge was poured through the tentacle's nervous system in a specific pattern, it emits a paralyzing cone of energy with a reasonably decent range. I'm neither an engineer or a biologist, so I do not really understand the mechanics of it." He pauses to watch as a technician installs the now-caged tentacle on top of the stock. "Suffice it to say, it is useless for sniping, but its ability to shoot through walls and affect areas makes it excellent for sweeping ships and building-to-building clearing operations.`
	"CN-16347" `	"All right, enough history." He turns to the technicians who are finishing the assembly. "The tentacle has been treated to resist decay and the stock mechanisms will provide basic maintenance routines for as long as you charge it regularly." He strides over, picks up the completed Void Rifle, and then hands it to you. "You are holding a piece of our history, Captain. Use it well!"`
	"CN-16348" `In the spaceport cafeteria, you spot the outfitter who asked you to retrieve a shipment of Hai keystones. He notices you and waves you over, gesturing at an empty chair opposite him.`
	"CN-16349" `	"Greetings, <first>! I trust you are settling in among us?" he signs using simple gestures. "I picked up a rumor that you are learning our language, too." You sign the affirmative as you sit down. "Good, that is useful." He pauses, then continues, "I never introduced myself before. My name is Aeolus, and I help manage resource logistics for our fleets." He eyes you for a moment, then ventures, "You came in here with the appearance of looking for something. Is there something on your mind?"`
	"CN-16350" `	"How is the outfit business going?"`
	"CN-16351" `	"That last job paid rather well. Do you have any more like it?"`
	"CN-16352" `	"Well, fairly well. Stocks are up, there are quite a few new outfits in the current, and some recent supply line disruptions have been resolved," he gestures appreciatively. "I am told that we have you to thank for some of that.`
	"CN-16353" `	"Those 'quantum keystones' you brought back have been quite interesting. The process of dismantling them for analysis yielded some intriguing results." He notices your expression. "Oh, you were expecting me to sell them, weren't you?"`
	"CN-16354" `	(Nod affirmatively.)`
	"CN-16355" `	(Shrug noncommittally.)`
	"CN-16356" `	"No, I suspected they would be studied instead."`
	"CN-16357" `	"What does 'outfits in the current' mean?"`
	"CN-16358" `	"Oh, that's just an expression. 'Current' refers to a current of air or water as a metaphor for the development process. It means that there are outfits that are progressing in the development process." He taps at his commlink for a moment. "Back before the Exodus, there was a saying: 'products in the pipeline.' I think that has a comparable meaning to us having 'something in the current.' I am curious, though. Were you expecting me to sell them?"`
	"CN-16359" `	Aeolus looks pleased at that. "You are correct. Finding something that does what the Quantum Key Stone does without being identical to it is clearly much more valuable as a subject of research than as a miscellaneous commodity. Add the security implications of slapping an alien device on a ship without thoroughly dismantling it, and the fact that we are not actually concerned with profit in the classical sense, and it is clear that they should not be simply dumped into the outfitting inventory."`
	"CN-16360" `	He looks slightly embarrassed. "Sorry to disappoint you, but none of those outfits were ever going to be used in the form they came in, for several different reasons." He ticks them off on his fingers as he lists them. "First, security: slapping an alien device on every ship without having thoroughly dismantled them would be an invitation to getting tracked. Second, research: something that does what the Quantum Key Stone does without being identical to it? Definitely interesting to our researchers. And third, purpose."`
	"CN-16361" `	He pauses to take a drink. "Unlike what you are probably used to from the outfitters you dealt with back in the ancestral worlds, my purpose is not to make money. Instead, I ensure that Remnant captains have the resources they need. What you see listed as the 'price,' Remnant captains see listed instead as a 'logistics adjustment' that indicates the amount of resources needed to supply that component. Every ship has a resource budget allocated to it, determining how much it can utilize for repairs, restocking, and improvements."`
	"CN-16362" `	"Wait, you didn't sell any of that?"`
	"CN-16363" `	"Okay, so that shipment you had me get...?"`
	"CN-16364" `	"I have to apologize for that. We knew from our histories that anyone from the ancestral worlds would be attracted by the opportunity to earn a profit, and we needed to give you both a reason to stay, and a way to gauge your willingness to help. Your shipment was definitely useful, but we had to ensure we framed your job in a way that made sense without revealing what we were actually doing.`
	"CN-16365" `	"So no, I don't have any jobs 'just like the last one,' but I know our researchers would like another shipment. Are you interested?"`
	"CN-16366" `	(Sign in the affirmative.)`
	"CN-16367" `	"Why would you assume that I needed a financial motivation?"`
	"CN-16368" `	"Great. They would like you to pick up another 19 keystones. Two differences this time: first, we would like you to pick them up from several different planets. And second, by the time you reach Hai space, we will have made arrangements so the shipments will be already paid for and waiting for you. Pick up the first stones on Greenwater, then the next set on Allhome. I will have a list sent to you by the time you reach Allhome."`
	"CN-16369" `	"That being said, if you happen to pick up any additional keystones, you can turn them in to the logistics office. They will handle the distribution and compensate you accordingly."`
	"CN-16370" `	"Wait, how will you get this all set up?"`
	"CN-16371" `	Aeolus looks faintly amused. "While you are certainly adventurous, you are not the only one to have traveled widely. We mapped the Hai systems long ago with cloaked ships, but never landed or contacted any of them. So we never knew anything more than what we could observe from orbit or from scanning ships. But you are known to them, and have a fairly public reputation. By using your transponder codes, we can place and pay for orders through hyperspace relays. All we need is a ship in position to feed the signal into the network."`
	"CN-16372" `	Aeolus smiles mysteriously at you. "Let's just say that you are not the only resourceful person among the Remnant. We will share more with you once you have demonstrated your loyalty."`
	"CN-16373" `	"While we don't know what is happening on the surface of planets in Ancestral space, we do pick up a fair number of transmissions. Between those and our historical records, it is clear to us that 'making money' is the main motivation for why those in ancestral space do anything. Whether it is ferrying cargo, building a structure, or protecting someone; everything we see says that humanity in ancestral space requires credits for everything it does. And then beyond that, the larger the amount of credits, the more enthusiastic they are to do it." Aeolus shakes his head, looking visibly perturbed. "This is what we see. Tell me, are we wrong? A quote we have seen more than a few times says 'Money makes the world go round,' and everything we have seen supports that attitude."`
	"CN-16374" `	"No, you aren't wrong. Money is the reason people work."`
	"CN-16375" `	"Yes and no. Most people work for money, but it isn't their only motivation."`
	"CN-16376" `	"You are wrong about that. Some people are all about money, but not everyone."`
	"CN-16377" `	"This isn't about everyone, this is about me. I'm not here for the money."`
	"CN-16378" `	"I am glad that some are willing to act for what is right, necessary or even just curiosity; and not just what they are paid for. It gives me hope for ancestral humanity." His look brightens a bit. "So, are you interested in another job to help us?"`
	"CN-16379" `	Aeolus nods sadly. "We appreciate the confirmation, and hope to learn more about those who remained in ancestral lands. It is depressing, however, to think that humanity is so self-centered to put financial wealth as such a high priority. Nonetheless, we do have another job for you. Are you interested?"`
	"CN-16380" `	Aeolus nods. "So financial wealth is a priority of necessity, but not necessarily what they would prefer to focus on. Interesting. That gives me a bit of hope." He pauses to consider this, then continues. "The economic beliefs of humanity aside, are you interested in helping us out?"`
	"CN-16381" `It takes a few minutes to contact the yardmaster, but once you do, a mixed crew of Hai and human dockworkers have the crates moved promptly from the warehouse to your cargo bay. Hai and humans seem accustomed to working together here.`
	"CN-16382" `True to Aeolus' word, there are crates of Hai quantum keystones waiting for you. As you ensure they are securely loaded, your comm system informs you that a message has arrived. It has no indication of provenance, but appears to be a notification that a payment of 250,000 credits marked 'on-assignment allowance' has been made to your account.`
	"CN-16383" `	The attached message is brief and to the point. "Greetings, Captain <first>. Hopefully the shipments were waiting for you. We have made arrangements for samples to be acquired from Makerplace, Stonebreak, Giverstone, Cloudfire, Snowfeather, Icelake, and Heartvalley. Once you have collected all those, head to Newhome. There are a few other places that we are still working to set up, and we should have those ready by the time you reach Newhome."`
	"CN-16384" `You are just checking in with the port authorities to locate your shipment when your commlink indicates a pair of messages incoming. While you wait for the second one to load, you see the first message is a deposit statement indicating that a payment of <payment> has been deposited from a "Solar Winds Logistics Ltd."`
	"CN-16385" `You quickly locate and load the shipment of quantum keystones. The packaging comes with brochures and images depicting comfortable-looking Hai relaxing on a spaceship observation deck. "Guaranteed to provide the smoothest flight for your passengers!" reads one of the labels.`
	"CN-16386" `Sure enough, there is a pair of crates waiting for you. This time the brochure depicts a pair of distinguished elderly Hai relaxing in front of a matte painting.`
	"CN-16387" `As you were reading the previous message, a freight hauler arrives with the last few crates and starts unloading them. Looking over the assembled stack, you note that each crate bears the logos and advertisements for a different organization, shipper, or enterprise. The second message turns out to be a confirmation that you have picked up 19 keystones. While there are no new instructions, the subtext is clear: Time to head back.`
	"CN-16388" `As you descend through the clouds to Viminal, you get the feeling someone is watching you, but your sensors show nothing more than a smattering of Gulls and a patrol squad in the distance. Looking down, you spot an extra battery of anti-air artillery next to the main entrance to the spaceport. You note the weapons tracking you and quickly tap your recognition code into the IFF system. Within seconds, the large guns are swinging back to cover the initial approach.`
	"CN-16389" `	Passing through a cavernous opening into the great spaceport dome, there is a shimmer in the air next to you as a Starling fades into view, settling onto the adjacent platform. The pilot signs a quick, "Greetings, anticipating talking with you," before heading back toward their lock. Behind them, the Starling continues its shutdown checks without any supervision at all.`
	"CN-16390" `	As you finish your own shutdown routine, your commlink informs you that your account has been updated with <payment>.`
	"CN-16391" `You exit the ship to find that the pilot is actually Aeolus, who has already marshaled some dock workers with a number of wagons and lifters to unload the cargo.`
	"CN-16392" `	"Ah, <first>, thank you for retrieving all these keystones." He sweeps some kind of a device over the crates, then opens one. He pokes at the contents, and pulls out a brochure with a picture of a quantum keystone and a pair of respectable looking Hai. "What's this?" He asks curiously. "Because I bought a keystone, they think I might need more? That seems like a decidedly inefficient way of promoting their product."`
	"CN-16393" `	"I'm not a fan of it either."`
	"CN-16394" `	"Those 'inefficient' capitalists did provide a keystone at one twentieth the cost you do."`
	"CN-16395" `	"You will probably do well here, then. Keep production and resources focused on the goal, that always made the most sense to me." Aeolus signs with confidence. "But economic theory aside, we have some science to do.`
	"CN-16396" `	"You've got a point there." Signs Aeolus. "Assuming they value a credit the same as we do and they aren't taking a loss, then it appears they do have a significant production and processing cost advantage." He takes on a defensive tone. "But for all we know, the supply of raw materials is much greater in Hai space, or most of these keystones could be simply recycled from older ships. And that is something we want to figure out." He brightens again. "That being said, we already have the first steps set out."`
	"CN-16397" `	"Our researchers have decided that we need to test how a ship performs with one of these keystones compared to a regular Key Stone. My ship has been outfitted with one built from the samples you brought us earlier. We request that you meet us in Peragenor, where you will scan us after going through the wormhole. Then we will return here and swap out the Hai keystone with one of our Key Stones. Then we will go back to Peragenor and perform another scan. By using the same ships for both tests, we should be able to get the best data."`
	"CN-16398" `	"Wait, you are a pilot?"`
	"CN-16399" `	"Oh, yes. It is actually quite common among the Remnant. I am not a particularly good pilot, but it is considered an important skill that is taught to almost everyone as a part of a general education. It is especially worthwhile for those of us who work directly with starships on a daily basis and may be called upon to move or fly one at a moment's notice." His gestures suggest both pride and humility as he talks about his piloting skills. "Anyway, let's go!"`
	"CN-16400" `The scanner chimes softly, informing you that it has completed scanning the Winds of Light and has successfully archived the data.`
	"CN-16401" `The scanner chimes softly once again, informing you that it has completed scanning the Winds of Light and has successfully archived the data from this second scanning.`
	"CN-16402" `When you and the <npc> settle back onto the landing pad, there is already a dockworker waiting with a Key Stone. Once the Starling is settled, the dockworker climbs up the outside of the ship, hooks the keystone to a lift and disconnects it from the ship. As the keystone is hauled up to the roof another lift lowers the replacement Key Stone. The dockworker quickly installs it and jumps down, landing gracefully from the several-meter drop.`
	"CN-16403" `	"Ready? Let's go!" Aeolus signs as he fires up his systems and gestures an acknowledgment to the dockworker. You check your cameras and see the worker nimbly step clear of the engine exhausts as the two ships head back out of the dome.`
	"CN-16404" `While in transit, you took the opportunity to examine the preliminary results of the scans: there are a few differences between the two stones, but both appear to have functioned similarly. Upon landing on Viminal, Aeolus comes over to collect a copy of the data for the researchers.`
	"CN-16405" `	"Thanks for your help, Captain <first>. This information may be valuable in understanding how the wormholes work." He pauses, then continues thoughtfully. "Perhaps more importantly, it may help us understand how the wormholes of the Ember Waste are different from the wormholes elsewhere that require no such aid."`
	"CN-16406" `	He looks down at the data crystal. "I have one more task to ask of you. Meet me in the cafeteria in an hour to discuss it. May the Embers burn bright for you, Captain." He gives a wave that seems vaguely like a salute and heads off.`
	"CN-16407" `	As he disappears from sight you hear a faint chime from your commlink, which displays a message indicating that two payments of <payment> have been allocated to your account. You recall that you didn't get a message after the last mission, so whichever Remnant person or agency is sending you these payments must have combined them. You do find it odd, however, that they always seem to know exactly when you finish a delivery.`
	"CN-16408" `You walk into the cafeteria and spot Aeolus halfway through an impressively large meal. He waves you over, and by the time you are seated a tray with a significantly smaller meal is waiting for you. While you have become accustomed to a few of the dishes, most of them are still very unappetizing.`
	"CN-16409" `	"The Remnant sure like to eat."`
	"CN-16410" `	"Why do the Remnant eat so much?"`
	"CN-16411" `	"Maybe I should import some spices."`
	"CN-16412" `	"What is our next step?"`
	"CN-16413" `	Aeolus chuckles and makes an amused gesture. "An army lives and dies by its food! A poorly fed soldier is but a short step away from being a deserter, or even a traitor. While we have had lean years in the past, these days we ensure everyone is well fed."`
	"CN-16414" `	He looks at you appraisingly. "There are some things you cannot learn yet. Ask us again when you have earned more of our trust."`
	"CN-16415" `	He leans forward and holds up his hands, poking at the leather fingerless gloves he is wearing, and you realize that they extend up under his sleeves. You note that the leather does not actually look like any leather you have seen - it has fine scales and rough ridges on it. What stands out the most, however, is that it appears to pulse faintly.`
	"CN-16416" `	"The truth is, when we eat, we are eating for two. You will have to ask someone else how they came to be or how it works, but suffice it to say that we have developed a symbiotic relationship with a variety of creatures we found here. These ones," He explains while holding up his hands, "have a knack for accuracy and durability. With them, I am more precise than I would otherwise be, and much tougher. In exchange, they feed through us and require regular care and attention. Normally, this causes us no hardship, but if we do not eat enough, we will consume our reserves far faster than we normally would."`
	"CN-16417" `	"That is quite the revelation."`
	"CN-16418" `	"Is that why some of the food tastes terrible?"`
	"CN-16419" `	"Sounds creepy."`
	"CN-16420" `	Aeolus nods. "From what I have heard, the ancestral worlds do not seem to have much in the way of exoskeletons or cybernetics. The living organisms we wear would certainly seem to be the realm of science-fiction." He contemplates his symbiont for a few seconds as he absent-mindedly eats more of his meal. "But education aside, there is work to do."`
	"CN-16421" `	He shakes his head. "I will not discourage you doing so - and I am sure some might appreciate them - but most of us like our food the way it is." He chuckles, then continues. "But there is still work to do."`
	"CN-16422" `	"I suppose it might. Our symbionts have different dietary requirements, and such unusual compounds in our food inevitably change the flavor. We are all long since used to it, but it would definitely be different for an outsider." He seems amused by this. "But enough of food - there is work to do!"`
	"CN-16423" `	"Creepy? I do not understand how something so useful and beneficial could be 'creepy,' but I suppose some might equate our symbionts with leeches. To each their own, I suppose." He shrugs, then continues. "But enough. We still have work to do."`
	"CN-16424" `	He pulls out a small metal briefcase and sets it on the table. "Another delivery mission for you, Captain. A short one, at that. We need you to take this case of data crystals with our preliminary data to some researchers on <destination>. This will allow them to combine the data we have collected with their most recent findings, and perhaps help us take a step forward towards understanding the nature of both these stones and the wormholes. Will you do it?"`
	"CN-16425" `A young researcher is waiting for you when you exit the <ship>. "Thank you for your assistance, Captain," she signs with one hand as she accepts the briefcase with the other. "There has been a lot of concentrated study on the wormholes over the past several centuries. While we know much about them..." she makes a convoluted gesture that you think translates to "knowing that you don't know."`
	"CN-16426" `	"Now, thanks to your acquisitions, we have the opportunity for new insights. We are looking forward to learning more about these anomalies. May the Embers burn bright for you, Captain." With that, she turns and heads off towards a lab.`
	"CN-16427" `	As you contemplate the implications of the Remnant studying the wormholes, your commlink chimes with a notification of another payment of <payment> being made to your account.`
	"CN-16428" `You glance into the starport cafeteria and see Dawn sitting at a table looking worried. She hasn't noticed you yet. Do you approach her?`
	"CN-16429" `	She smiles when she sees you, and waves you to the seat opposite her. "Back from gallivanting around the galaxy with more tales to share?" she signs.`
	"CN-16430" `	"Yes, as a matter of fact..."`
	"CN-16431" `	"No, just hunting Korath..."`
	"CN-16432" `	"No, just testing some stuff..."`
	"CN-16433" `	"You look worried. Is something happening?"`
	"CN-16434" `	She listens for a minute or two as you tell her about what you've been up to, but it's obvious that she has something else on her mind.`
	"CN-16435" `	"You look worried. Is everything alright?"`
	"CN-16436" `	"You look distracted. Do you want to talk about it?"`
	"CN-16437" `	She makes a gesture of appreciation. "Yes, I am worried, <first>. I keep feeling like there is something I am missing." She frowns, contemplating something unseen. "I should back up a step. Since we last talked, I was assigned to serve with an astrophysics team for a year. My current work is part of the quantum condensate fabric density project, and I have been tasked with reviewing our bulk astrophysical data. It is fairly routine, but I keep getting this prickly feeling that there is a problem that I am missing. Nothing obvious, of course. Our neural networks would pick up something explicit or repetitive very quickly. But the feeling just will not go away."`
	"CN-16438" `	"Have you asked someone with more experience for advice?"`
	"CN-16439" `	"Can I help with something?"`
	"CN-16440" `	"What is the quantum condensate fabric density project?"`
	"CN-16441" `	"I did. The senior researcher told me that most of the team feels something is not quite right here. They say there are some potential theories, but nothing definitive, so they want me to investigate on my own without contaminating my thoughts with their ideas for now."`
	"CN-16442" `	"It is basically a project examining the density of Bose-Einstein condensates as correlated to the revised relativity paradigm's conceptualization of the fabric of space-time. It has a lot of potential implications, particularly for ramscoop, scanner, and weapons technology. At least, that is the hope. For now, though, I am trying to figure out what is off about this data."`
	"CN-16443" `	"Thanks for the advice, but that is our purpose here - to worry about all the things that humanity either cannot handle or that it turns a blind eye to. No, if there is something in the data to cause worry, we need to find it."`
	"CN-16444" `	"If you would like to help, there is something you can do. I am currently putting together an expedition to Sagittarius A* to collect some fresh data I can use to check our records, and I could use a transport..." She looks at you hopefully.`
	"CN-16445" `	"I don't know where that is."`
	"CN-16446" `	"Isn't that the center of the galaxy?"`
	"CN-16447" `	"I have been there."`
	"CN-16448" `	"Really?" She looks surprised. "I have seen sensor logs and recordings from previous visits, but not many people have actually been there." She pauses to take a bite from her neglected meal. "Being able to take part in these fieldwork expeditions is something I have been looking forward to for ages, so of course Sagittarius A* is the first place on my list."`
	"CN-16449" `	"Yes, that is correct." She signs firmly.`
	"CN-16450" `	Her signs take on a rhythmic pace as if reciting something. "Sagittarius A* is a strong astronomical radio source and a supermassive black hole that is located at the center of the Milky Way. According to our best measurements, it has a mass of 3F6290 solar masses and is surrounded by a ring of gas and dust that can range from 63 to 24D2 degrees Kelvin."`
	"CN-16451" `	She returns to a conversational cadence. "Would you be interested in taking part in this expedition?"`
	"CN-16452" `	"Sure, what do you need?"`
	"CN-16453" `	"You want me to take you to a black hole?!"`
	"CN-16454" `	"Sorry, I'm not interested in visiting a black hole."`
	"CN-16455" `	She looks momentarily surprised by your reaction. "Yes, exactly that. Current gravitational repulsor engines can nullify most of the gravitational pull, and an extra Thermoelectric Cooler or two should be sufficient to manage the heat. As such, the risks are manageable so long as you do not try to approach the event horizon.`
	"CN-16456" `	"For this particular mission, we will need some additional scientific equipment that is actually hardwired into your ship, not just carried along with us. When we arrive on <planet>, they will have the equipment ready to install. Just be aware that it will require six tons of outfit space and a scientist to run it, so you will need a free bunk for them, too.`
	"CN-16457" `	"Once the laboratory module is installed, it will simply be a matter of traveling to Sagittarius A*. After our measurements, recordings, and observations are complete, we will return and report on our findings."`
	"CN-16458" `	She glances down at her half-finished meal. "I am already packed and ready to go. I will meet you onboard the <ship> as soon as I am done eating."`
	"CN-16459" `	"Okay, I will meet you onboard the ship."`
	"CN-16460" `	"Developed quite the appetite, haven't you?"`
	"CN-16461" `	She shrugs. "I burn a lot of calories, and healthy eating is important. Besides, I don't know how good food will be on your ship." She resumes eating with vigor and does not seem inclined to continue the conversation.`
	"CN-16462" `	"I am not yet used to the nutrient intake required to maintain my symbiont, so I have to consciously make sure that I eat enough to sustain it."`
	"CN-16463" `	"Symbiont? What is that?"`
	"CN-16464" `	"What? You're joking, right?"`
	"CN-16465" `	"Suit yourself. I will meet you onboard once I'm done." She shrugs, and returns to eating.`
	"CN-16466" `	"Oh, no one has told you about them? I thought once you'd demonstrated your trustworthiness and earned your capital ship license you would have found out." She pauses to take another bite, then continues.`
	"CN-16467" `	She nods. "Yes, I am not yet used to the nutrient intake required to maintain my symbiont, so I have to consciously make sure that I eat enough to sustain it."`
	"CN-16468" `	"Interesting. I will see you onboard the <ship>."`
	"CN-16469" `	"Could you tell me more about them?"`
	"CN-16470" `	"In short, we domesticated some of the creatures found here ages ago and discovered that they could be attached to us to form a symbiotic relationship." She pauses again to eat. "I only recently received mine, so I am not fully adjusted to it yet."`
	"CN-16471" `	"Okay, that's as much as I need to know."`
	"CN-16472" `	"What is it like to have a symbiont?"`
	"CN-16473" `	"Oh, it is wonderful. It is very hard to describe. At first it is just slimy, then a lot of tingling. The tingling lasted for several hours, and then it was just like waking up: rising up out of darkness to a brighter world with just so much to see and learn. Suddenly, it was as if everything was moving slower, and I could take a long, hard look at everything..." Dawn is visibly excited, signing so fast you have trouble following.`
	"CN-16474" `	"Thanks for the description. I should go prep the <ship> now."`
	"CN-16475" `	"Where is your symbiont? Yours does not seem to be obvious."`
	"CN-16476" `	"Could I see your symbiont?"`
	"CN-16477" `	Dawn looks at you with an amused expression. "We do not know each other nearly well enough for that. Better to focus on the expedition. I will catch up to you on the ship."`
	"CN-16478" `	She nods. "Well, I will finish my meal and meet you on the <ship> shortly." With that, she returns to her meal.`
	"CN-16479" `	Dawn looks at you with an amused expression. "Just as every human is a unique individual, so every symbiont is also unique. As such, they attach to different areas of the body. We do not know each other well enough for me to tell you more than that.`
	"CN-16480" `	"We should probably be focusing on the expedition, though. You go get the <ship> ready for launch, and I will be there shortly."`
	"CN-16481" `You follow the directions of the starport control and settle onto a pad next to the outfitter. You barely have a chance to finish your landing checks before a team of Remnant have a compact pod waiting on your loading ramp. Once you open the cargo bay doors, they pick it up and maneuver it inside. They start securing it to the ship while Dawn and one of the scientists approaches you.`
	"CN-16482" `	"We have loaded the Research Laboratory onboard. The team will install it if they can find the space, but if they do not, it will be secured in the cargo bay," The Remnant scientist explains. "Before you depart, please verify that the laboratory is installed in the correct location. You know your ship better than we do, after all." She turns back to Dawn and makes a gesture of respect. "Embers guide your path, Seeker." With that, she strides away into the hive of activity that is the outfitting bays.`
	"CN-16483" `	"So, what is our next step?"`
	"CN-16484" `	"Seeker?"`
	"CN-16485" `	Dawn looks a little embarrassed. "Seeker is a title of respect for deep space explorers. It is unofficial - just a token of respect - but it is a title that I both aspire to earn and do not feel I deserve yet."`
	"CN-16486" `	"I thought all Remnant were spacefarers?"`
	"CN-16487" `	"Okay. So what next?"`
	"CN-16488" `	"Oh, we are. Every Remnant has had some experience in space. But there is a big difference between a few weeks of duty in a spacefaring post and spending months or years drifting in the void surrounding distant systems."`
	"CN-16489" `	"Years drifting in the void?"`
	"CN-16490" `	"Okay, let's get on with this."`
	"CN-16491" `	"If you want good data, you need to spend time to get it. And especially when we are tracking stellar phenomena, you need periods of long observation. Snapshots of the sky are good - that is what we will be collecting on this trip. But for watching the galaxy at large, other civilizations, and things of that ilk... Nothing is better than long-term observation." She looks lost in thought for a moment. "That is neither here nor there, however.`
	"CN-16492" `	"Now that you have the Research Laboratory, you will need to locate a jump drive in order to reach Sagittarius A*." She pauses and checks her commlink. "If you do not already have one, you can salvage one from a Korath raider. Our early warning system indicates that there are several incoming Korath fleets that should be here within the next day or two. Any one of them should have a jump drive you can take. Meet me in the starport once you have a jump drive."`
	"CN-16493" `Dawn is just finishing her meal when you enter the spaceport cafeteria. She stands up as you approach and deposits the tray in a receptacle next to her table. "Well, ready to go?"`
	"CN-16494" `	"I should double check everything."`
	"CN-16495" `	She nods. "I am ready, so I will come with you and wait onboard the <ship> while you do your checks."`
	"CN-16496" `	She gestures towards the exit closest to your ship and heads off at a quick pace. Outside, she moves calmly through the hustle and bustle of the starport, stepping around quick-moving freight movers and camel wagons alike. Arriving at the <ship>, she turns and waits for you to catch up.`
	"CN-16497" `	Just as you arrive and reach for the console to open the airlock, you sense a change in your surroundings. Looking around, you see that a group of Remnant gathered around the two of you, focused on Dawn. A young Remnant - scarcely more than a child - steps forward. "Thank you for your patience," he says, then steps back. An elderly Remnant steps forward. "Thank you for your curiosity," she says, then steps back. A middle-aged Remnant steps forward. "Go with our blessing, Seeker, and know that wherever you go, the Remnant go with you." She says it simply, but you feel the weight of tradition behind them. She turns to you. "And you, stranger who walks the stars... May the Embers guide your steps as you walk among us." She nods respectfully, then steps back.`
	"CN-16498" `	As soon as the third steps back there is a flurry of movement as each of the Remnant present quickly step forward, give her a quick hug, and then scurry off into the starport. Before you process what is going on, all the Remnant gathered around you have vanished. You look at Dawn, and her expression is a mixture of awe and humility.`
	"CN-16499" `	"They know you are coming back, right?"`
	"CN-16500" `	"What was that about?"`
	"CN-16501" `	"Alright, let's get going."`
	"CN-16502" `	"Well, what we are doing is dangerous. We will be crossing Korath territory, a wide expanse of uninhabited space, and then scanning a black hole. I have confidence that we will return, but nonetheless there is still a chance that we will die in the process.`
	"CN-16503" `	"Long ago we, as a people, decided that we must face the fear of separation, unknown, and danger. One of the ways we do that is by holding these informal ceremonies. When one of us is going to depart on their first long-distance voyage into hostile territory, a group of Remnant gather to bid them farewell. It is a way to strengthen ourselves and remind each other of our connections."`
	"CN-16504" `	"Kind of like a funeral, with friends and family gathering to see you off?"`
	"CN-16505" `	"Oh, no. I said my farewells to my friends and relatives before we left. Those who gathered to see me off today were more of a representation of Remnant society. I only recognized a few of them, but they took the time to come down to the <ship> to meet me before I left. They came to see me and wish me well, so that no matter what challenges I face, I will know that the Remnant remember me and appreciate what I am doing." Her gestures fade into contemplative stillness for a moment, then resume motion.`
	"CN-16506" `	She gestures towards the airlock door. "Lead the way, Captain."`
	"CN-16507" `As the jump drive's energy ripples fade away, the spectacular void that is Sagittarius A* takes shape before you. Compared to the vast darkness of space that you are accustomed to, reality here feels almost like a color negative: even with the automatic filtering in your windows, space is incredibly bright with the densely packed stars that provide a backdrop for its inky mass. The moment of awe is shattered by alarms warning of your impending doom as the <ship> begins to fall inwards towards the black hole. You quickly activate your repulsor engines, which, although vastly under-powered for dealing with the immense pull of a black hole, does provide a degree of protection so long as you maintain a safe distance from it.`
	"CN-16508" `	After a few minutes of just absorbing the spectacle before you, Dawn pulls herself away from the cockpit windows and scurries down to the lab. Leaving you to your thoughts, she quickly has the lab set up and running a variety of recordings, tests, and observations. After a few hours of work, she reappears on the bridge.`
	"CN-16509" `	"Things are proceeding smoothly, Captain. All the sensors are working nominally, and we are creating extensive archives of astronomical data as well. Another few hours, and we should have all the data we need."`
	"CN-16510" `	"Good work. What kind of data are you recording?"`
	"CN-16511" `	"Sounds good. Just let me know when you are ready to leave."`
	"CN-16512" `	She smiles, and replies. "It might be easier to ask what we are leaving out. The data we are collecting broadly falls into three sets: data on Sagittarius A* itself, data on its environment, and observations of the surrounding galaxy from here. Obviously, we cannot go take samples of Sagittarius A* itself, nor can we take direct measurements of most of its properties, but we can get data from increasingly minute distances from the event horizon. We can then add this data to that gathered by previous expeditions, note the differences, and use it in our modeling."`
	"CN-16513" `	"So this is not the first expedition here?"`
	"CN-16514" `	"Anything unusual in the data?"`
	"CN-16515" `	"How much longer does the equipment need?"`
	"CN-16516" `	"No, this is the forty-third such expedition. Sagittarius A* was one of the first places our explorers sought to visit after we acquired jump drives, and we have been coming back regularly ever since. I know some of our reconnaissance pilots consider visiting here a pilgrimage of sorts. It is humbling to be here myself after reviewing so many data sets of past expeditions." She looks thoughtful, staring out the window at the hub of the galaxy, as if her thoughts are jumping from idea to idea.`
	"CN-16517" `	"There are many oddities about this place. Every visit helps revise our physics models a little closer. But they also reveal problems." She frowns, her gestures taking on a curious tone. "For instance, you will note that your ramscoops are not picking up anything. According to standard astronomical theory, this system should be a veritable river of suitable material, and yet there is nothing. Not even the normal background trace amounts we find in deep space. We have visited other black holes, and they conform to the standard models in this respect. But not Sagittarius A*." She pauses, thinking about it for a moment.`
	"CN-16518" `	"Is the equipment finished?"`
	"CN-16519" `	"The equipment will be finished shortly, Captain <first>. I just need to make a few observations, and then we will be able to depart. In the meantime, I would recommend against maintaining an active cloak or engaging any systems that consume fuel. For whatever reason, Sagittarius A* continues to be the one place that the stellar wind is utterly devoid of anything to collect as fuel."`
	"CN-16520" `	"I will be going outside for a few minutes," Dawn declares. "I shall just be on the hull."`
	"CN-16521" `	"Let me know when you are done."`
	"CN-16522" `	"Would you mind if I came too?"`
	"CN-16523" `	"Not at all, Captain. The view should be remarkable, and so long as we stay inside the shields, the radiation will not pose a problem." You quickly don your spacesuit and join Dawn outside on the hull. As promised, the view is indeed magnificent. Dawn signs occasionally, pointing out various features, and you appreciate that out here, sound would just be incongruous with the natural splendor.`
	"CN-16524" `	After what feels like hours, the equipment notifies you that it has finished taking its readings, and Dawn packs up the data in carefully shielded data crystals. Everything is ready to return to <destination>.`
	"CN-16525" `The journey back to <planet> was a lesson in galactic formation as the <ship> jumped through a steady stream of systems. Gradually, the brilliant density of stars that make up the inner core faded into the ominous and yet comfortingly familiar red glow of the Ember Waste. Finally, you slide into the approach patterns of <planet>, quickly tapping out your code into the IFF system and watching as the protective gaze of the anti-air emplacements sweep the skies around you for shadowing craft.`
	"CN-16526" `You settle onto your assigned pad, and within seconds Remnant technicians have resupply cables hooked up while a cheerful group greets Dawn before helping her unload her luggage and data crystals. "Well, <first>, it has been a good trip." She taps at her commlink. "I have transferred our expedition's logistics allotment of <payment> to you. And in case you're wondering what to do with your Research Laboratory, you can keep it. We always need fresh data, and if you are interested, you can check up on places designated in the job board. While I handled the science on this expedition, if you keep it installed your ship systems will automatically hire a scientist to run it." She nods her head in respect to you. "Thank you, and may the Embers watch over you." She turns and heads off into the flows of people.`
	"CN-16527" `As you cross the starport, you are suddenly ambushed by Dawn appearing out of a side hallway. "Captain <first>! I have been hoping to catch you. I need some help." She hurries up, waving a datapad full of charts. "I have some additional leads for my research project, and I need a pilot who can take me out to Aescolanus." She looks at you hopefully.`
	"CN-16528" `	"Sure, I am always willing to help."`
	"CN-16529" `	"Not today, sorry."`
	"CN-16530" `	"Excellent! You already have a Research Laboratory onboard, and it has all the equipment I need. Now, before we head out, you should know that the goal of this mission is to do some analysis on the leading edge of a storm that will be breaking on the system shortly. We do not need to weather the entire storm, but we will have to be there for at least the first part."`
	"CN-16531" `	"Are there any special adjustments needed?"`
	"CN-16532" `	"The <ship> is ready to go."`
	"CN-16533" `	"Well, I expect you are already set up to handle the normal Ember Waste heat, correct?" She continues without waiting for you to reply. "The Ember Waste storms are primarily a danger to electrical systems - typically by draining your power. So you can compensate by ensuring that you have some excess available for use. I know some captains carry extra generators to ensure they always have extra power, but others instead carry extra Crystal Capacitors so they can outlast the storm. In theory, you could just accept that your ship will be shut down during the height of the storm, and simply reboot everything afterwards. So long as no threats are present, it is safe but somewhat nerve-wracking. Which strategy fits the <ship> is up to you."`
	"CN-16534" `	"I will settle into a bunk to do some pre-calculations. Please let me know when we arrive in Aescolanus."`
	"CN-16535" `"Thank you for your help, <first>. Sometimes I have to wait a while before we have a ship available to do missions like these." She pauses, then taps her commlink. "Speaking of which, I have confirmed the transfer of the logistics fee of <payment> to your account."`
	"CN-16536" `	"I am always happy to help. What are you working on now, anyway?"`
	"CN-16537" `	"I am always happy to help. See you around!"`
	"CN-16538" `	"How familiar are you with the nature of space?"`
	"CN-16539" `	"Not very, to be honest."`
	"CN-16540" `	"I know space is a vacuum, and can be either extremely hot or extremely cold depending on circumstances..."`
	"CN-16541" `	She nods "Honesty is good. It is hard to learn when we are not willing to admit that we do not know something."`
	"CN-16542" `	She nods "Those are the basics, a good starting point."`
	"CN-16543" `	A hologram of the Ember Waste appears over her commlink. "As you have no doubt picked up on, the Ember Waste does not conform to humanity's commonly understood rules about space. For instance, the standard background temperature is 2.B1 degrees, and the average density of the interstellar medium is F4240 particles per cubic meter. Here in the Ember Waste, the average background temperature is an order of magnitude greater and has an average density of E8D4A51000 particles per cubic meter."`
	"CN-16544" `	The display changes as an overlay of haze appears, pulsing in intensity. "Most interestingly, though, is that this area is significantly more variable than the rest of the galaxy. The haze shown here represents the heat hazard schematic we produce for our captains. It combines the local density with the measured heat values to estimate how much heat ships will be exposed to in the area."`
	"CN-16545" `	"Interesting! Is that what causes the red glow?"`
	"CN-16546" `	"Wait a second. Why are there letters in your numbers?"`
	"CN-16547" `	"Thanks! I think that is all the details I can handle right now."`
	"CN-16548" `	"Not really, although it does contribute to it. Most of the red glow seems to be the result of clouds of hydrogen gases at approximately 2710 degrees, rather like the process documented by early Earth astronomers investigating nebulae. Except for most of these clouds, there is no obvious source of energy to keep the hydrogen excited. Obviously there is still energy being added to the system, but..." She trails off and gestures deprecatingly. "One more mystery to keep us alert and attentive."`
	"CN-16549" `	She smiles thoughtfully, and the display changes with the red haze vanishing and a silvery haze replacing it. "But that is where today's research comes in. We have been measuring these storms since we arrived in the Ember Waste. The human eye can only pick out a few of them on the display, but our algorithms have identified a significant number of ripples of energy." She appears thoughtful.`
	"CN-16550" `	"It is almost like watching the surface of a pond during a rainstorm: The surface appears to be chaotic, but with detailed enough instrumentation, one can pick out individual ripples and trace their paths backwards... except we have yet to find an actual source for any of them. We can trace every ripple on a pond in a storm and find its origin, but we have yet to learn the dance that we have lived in for half a millennia."`
	"CN-16551" `	"What do the storms have to do with the heat?"`
	"CN-16552" `	"What units do you use for temperature?"`
	"CN-16553" `	"I think that is all the technical detail I can take."`
	"CN-16554" `	She looks mischievous. "I cannot tell you where or how we got it, but look at this." Her display shifts again with the hazes vanishing, and shows the galaxy map with one key difference. "Yes, the Ember Wastes are violet. Actually, they are off the visual spectrum into the ultraviolets, but this downshifts it so we can see it. This is what the Ember Wastes looked like a very long time ago."`
	"CN-16555" `	She takes on a serious tone. "This data suggests there is enough energy in the area to maintain the hydrogen at somewhere in excess of 61A8 degrees. It does not tell us the source of that energy, but based on patterns and some other data we have collected, the two appear to be intertwined. At the very least, the ion storms are one of the means by which energy is being transferred into the clouds." Her display vanishes, and she slings her backpack over her shoulder.`
	"CN-16556" `	She looks confused for a moment before responding. "It is called hexadecimal. It is a base 16 numeric system." She pauses to look at you. "Based on your reaction, I assume that base 10 is still the standard in human space?"`
	"CN-16557" `	"How does that work?"`
	"CN-16558" `	"Quite simply: We have added some extra characters. When counting, instead of a single digit position restarting at 0 every 10, they cycle every 16. So when we count, we start at 1, but when we reach 9, the next number will be A. Then B, C, D, E and F. Then, it is at that point that we add an extra digit and restart at 0 with 10. So in hexadecimal F would be equal to 15 in base 10. One of the advantages of using a numeric system with a higher base is that we can handle larger numbers with fewer digits. For example, with two digits we can communicate any integer up to what would be 255 in base 10. Or with three digits we can reach 4095. Saving an extra digit here or there is fairly meaningless in written formats, nor is it much of a difference in oral communication. However, when one communicates by gestures, it is helpful to shorten the numbers where we can."`
	"CN-16559" `	"Now that you understand our numbers a bit better, you will be able to recognize that there is a lot of unexplained energy being transferred out there."`
	"CN-16560" `	"Right. Is that what causes the red glow?"`
	"CN-16561" `	She looks at you curiously. "Corrected degrees Kelvin, of course. Why?"`
	"CN-16562" `	"What are 'Corrected degrees Kelvin'?"`
	"CN-16563" `	"Just clarifying. I prefer to use degrees Centigrade."`
	"CN-16564" `	"Just clarifying. I prefer to use degrees Fahrenheit."`
	"CN-16565" `	"Corrected degrees Kelvin are basically the standard Kelvin scale developed millennia ago, but with a slight correction factor to account for the adjustments determined by the conjunction of 2730. It is a rather minuscule change to the scale that is mostly only applicable to experiments or industrial applications that require micro-degree temperature precision, but can be significant at the larger scales." The display and its field of stars vanishes as she slings her backpack over her shoulder.`
	"CN-16566" `	"People still use that? We learned about it in our studies, mostly in case we came across references to it our library. I have seen it a few times, but it is rarely used among us." The display and its field of stars vanishes as she slings her backpack over her shoulder.`
	"CN-16567" `	She looks at you quizzically for a moment, and then her display shifts to a mass of symbols. She skims briefly. "I have never even heard of such a unit. Apparently it is a very old one, though. Our records say that it had largely stopped being used by early in the 21st century. Well, I learned something new today." The display and its field of symbols vanishes as she slings her backpack over her shoulder.`
	"CN-16568" `	"Thanks for the ride, Captain. I have to get working on this data, but if you are interested in helping some more, I hope to have more research expeditions planned soon."`
	"CN-16569" `You step into the strange sight of the <origin> spaceport. The structures that surround the landing pads look as much grown as built, and they seem to merge into the landing pads themselves. As usual, the dock entrance is busy. When your commlink vibrates, you have to find a place where the traffic eddies so you can step aside. When you do, you learn you need to check in with the information desk.`
	"CN-16570" `	The woman working the desk seems startled to see you when you walk up. You can see the realization dawn on her as she looks you over with a practiced eye. "Ah," she sings, "you are the ancestral sojourner among us."`
	"CN-16571" `	It is typical for people to gawk at you, so you respond by singing, "I've been guided to friends I didn't know, and your message invited me to meet a new one."`
	"CN-16572" `	Her hands make a short series of shakes and a moment later she remembers to laugh for you. The delayed response makes her laugh again, spontaneously this time, and you both join in. When she recovers herself, she sings, "Logistics have requested that we find someone who can carry <tons> of cargo to <planet>. Is the <ship> available immediately?"`
	"CN-16573" `	"Certainly!"`
	"CN-16574" `	"Sorry, it is not."`
	"CN-16575" `	"Excellent," she responds in a full alto, "I will let the project manager know the cargo will arrive promptly." She signs what you think is a farewell and turns to address someone else who has stepped up.`
	"CN-16576" `	You manage to chant and point your way through the cafeteria line, and you are aware of the flurry of signs around you. There doesn't seem to be a way to pay, so you find a table and sit alone until your commlink chimes to let you know that the <ship> has been refueled and the mystery cargo loaded.`
	"CN-16577" `	"That is unfortunate," she sings as she makes a notation on her terminal. "But there will be others who are willing to help."`
	"CN-16578" `You step off the <ship> on <planet> to see a man wandering around your ship taking video with a datapad and softly dictating some running commentary. He dodges around the dock workers unloading and refueling, seemingly intent on recording every aspect of your ship.`
	"CN-16579" `	"Cousin!" he sings with excitement when you walk up to him. "It is good to meet you and to see your wonderful ship. It excites me to be able to examine something I have only seen in entertainments based on our scouting reports." He holds up the datapad facing you and says, "I am making a video for my companion. He will not believe me unless I have proof, and maybe not even then!" he laughs. You wave at the camera and he stops recording.`
	"CN-16580" `	"I hope I have not offended you. I get carried away looking at ships." He runs his hand along the landing strut but then seems to collect himself and turn back to you. "I am named Eon," he says. "Would you have time to talk about logistics support?"`
	"CN-16581" `	"Yes, I've been looking for more work with the Remnant."`
	"CN-16582" `	"Yes, there haven't been many opportunities so far."`
	"CN-16583" `Eon leads you to the bustling cafeteria, chattering about ship design since the Alpha Wars. He orders a couple of hot drinks and leads you to a quiet table overlooking the docks. You try your drink. It's strongly flavored but a bit odd, like someone's memory of what coffee should taste like, reconstituted from local foods.`
	"CN-16584" `	Eon leaves his untouched as he launches into conversation. "Those of us in logistics have noticed that you are spending time in our systems, and we wanted to see if you would be available to pick up work for us. It would be delivery work like the generator you brought for the housing project."`
	"CN-16585" `	"You put starship radiothermals in your houses?"`
	"CN-16586" `	"You do not?" he responds playfully. "Well, 'generators in each community' would be more accurate. We maintain a decentralized power grid so we have more resiliency in the event of an attack or natural disaster. It also makes use of the power plants we salvage from the Korath and ones we recover from our own damaged ships. Besides, widely deploying the technology ensures that we have expertise to maintain and repair it all across the Remnant. But," he signs a pushing motion, "civil engineering is another subject. I hope you are more interested in how we move our various cargoes."`
	"CN-16587" `	"That generator was originally scheduled for delivery 30 days from now, but it was ready earlier and the project can install it now. So, by bringing it over, you have enabled us to move the project forward and free up delivery capacity next month."`
	"CN-16588" `	"So, why did you offer this work to me?" you ask, trying to mimic the gestures you've seen that you think refer to one's self.`
	"CN-16589" `	He smiles and responds, "Very good! Very good! We schedule everything, but we maintain slack in the system to take advantage of opportunities like the power system being ready early, or to deal with emergencies. Sometimes, of course, we have to drop everything and sort the schedule out later. But, in normal times, we publish these jobs on the job board and captains that have capacity available can pick them up. The projects provide resource allocations to cover operating and crew costs, but there is no... what is the word? Margin, yes! Since your ship is not in our planned resources, you provide extra capacity, and we might be able to move some of our larger projects forward when you are in our space."`
	"CN-16590" `	"Thanks for the opportunity."`
	"CN-16591" `	"Will your pilots be upset at the competition?"`
	"CN-16592" `	Eon smiles at the question. "You should talk to the other pilots and see, but I think the ancestral approach is different. We work more like a military: the ships are owned by the Remnant, but each captain is responsible for the ship, the crew, and the transport work that needs to be done. I think they will be happy to see new homes being built, and freeing up more time for them and their crews to spend within the community."`
	"CN-16593" `	Before you can ask more about transport jobs, Eon takes out his commlink and taps on it for a few minutes. "You now have access to the logistics job board. You should be able to see our current job list for each system when you check."`
	"CN-16594" `	You continue to chat with Eon as you sip your drink. When you finish, his commlink chirps. As he stands, he signs what you think means "goodbye" as he says he has to leave for another meeting. He walks off quickly with his head down looking at the datapad. Your commlink notifies you that <payment> have been added to your account.`
	"CN-16595" `A familiar face is waiting for you as you step into the crowded spaceport on Aventine. "Captain <first>!" signs Plume. "I have been hoping you would stop by." He gestures for you to sit down on the bench next to him.`
	"CN-16596" `	"Now that most of the cocoons have been returned, I would like you to return to Nasqueron and Slylandro to observe the void sprites' behavior. It is my hope that we can gain far greater insight into their life cycle."`
	"CN-16597" `	"Sure, I could do that."`
	"CN-16598" `	"Not right now, but I could later."`
	"CN-16599" `	"How much will I get paid?"`
	"CN-16600" `	"Once the research is published, you will receive one million credits."`
	"CN-16601" `	"Excellent. As before, please visit both Nasqueron and Slylandro, record the void sprites there, and return here."`
	"CN-16602" `As you scan the system, the first thing you notice is that the void sprites' behavior seems different: there are fewer of them flying around, and the few that you see seem to be almost timid - floating quietly, and dropping down into the cloud deck whenever your ship moves towards them. You recall that Plume asked you to visit both planets.`
	"CN-16603" `The void sprites here prove to be elusive. You spend quite a while chasing radar signatures before you finally manage to get a small flock of them into visual range. You record them from a distance for several minutes, until they suddenly disperse into a storm and vanish.`
	"CN-16604" `Disappointed in the void sprites' behavior, you deliver the recordings to Plume's lab without fanfare. Plume quickly takes and reviews the footage before making a gesture that you think means "curious dejection." Then he seems to notice something, and resumes his usual intent bearing.`
	"CN-16605" `	"Here, look!" He rewinds the recording and gestures curtly at the projection in front of you. "There. That one is injured. Some kind of burn in a long, straight line." He zips through the footage further. "And here, a scattering of scorch marks." He looks up at you and snaps out a series of gestures: "This is outside my expertise; I will need to consult an expert. Meet me in the spaceport in an hour."`
	"CN-16606" `You arrive in the spaceport to find Plume pacing quickly along a walkway. He gestures a quick greeting and jumps straight to the point. "We have never seen marks like these naturally appear on void sprites, but they match the weapon scoring patterns we have seen delivered by Korath ships. As such, we believe the Korath have begun hunting void sprites."`
	"CN-16607" `	He looks at you with a surprising amount of vigor. "I will not have our work ruined by reptilian warmongers. Destroy the Korath hunters responsible, then we can continue the research."`
	"CN-16608" `	"Okay, I will destroy the Korath hunters' ship."`
	"CN-16609" `	"Do you have the authority to order that?"`
	"CN-16610" `	He nods curtly. "I do not have the authority to raise a fleet or order a captain to destroy the ship, but I can declare this Korath a threat to Remnant interests. It is up to you to decide how to respond to the identification of that threat."`
	"CN-16611" `	(Accept his explanation.)`
	"CN-16612" `	"Could you explain?"`
	"CN-16613" `	"While the Remnant have an all-encompassing hierarchy to ensure everyone answers to someone, we saw fit to keep all facets of our society merged to prevent fragmentation into 'civilian' or 'military' branches. Two aspects of this merging are the decision of when to invoke military force and what amount of force is worthwhile. According to my position as a researcher, I have the authority to designate something a threat to my projects or to the Remnant as a whole. I could even order someone to act on it. However, given that I am of low status in terms of military proficiency, I cannot dictate the magnitude of the military response, and I am subject to being overruled by those with higher military qualifications."`
	"CN-16614" `	"In our particular situation, I have higher xenobiology qualifications than you, so I can dictate to you, and most other xenobiologists, for that matter, that protecting the void sprites is a priority. However, you are more skilled at combat and military matters than I am. Therefore it is your decision as to how important it is relative to other military tasks. Likewise, it is your decision as to what amount of force is required, tactics used, or other such military considerations."`
	"CN-16615" `	"This is one of the aspects that set prefects apart: they are Remnant who have demonstrated excellence in their field, sound judgment across a variety of fields, and an affinity for balancing a multitude of demands on Remnant resources. Humility is also a requirement, as they must always recognize that while their particular combination of skills may be unique, there is always someone else who is better than them at any one thing. As such, prefects are the adjudicators in determining the priorities of our various tasks and the leaders who keep the Remnant unified."`
	"CN-16616" `	"Thanks for the explanation!"`
	"CN-16617" `	"I thought prefects were specialists."`
	"CN-16618" `	"Well, they are and are not. Most prefects are assigned particular tasks that they are expected to devote themselves to. Often, this task relates to their area of expertise, but it is not always the case. Generally speaking, a prefect is considered to be the ultimate authority on tasks that they have been assigned to, but they are expected to take into account the suggestions from other prefects and the specialists in the fields relevant to the task.`
	"CN-16619" `	"Given your own skills, I suspect that the prefects you are most likely to interact with would be Prefect Chilia, who coordinates the military defense of the Remnant, and Prefect Taely, who integrates our latest innovations into usable ships."`
	"CN-16620" `	"Thanks! That was more detail than I was expecting."`
	"CN-16621" `	"Okay, that satisfied my curiosity for now."`
	"CN-16622" `	"Excellent. You deal with the Korath, and I will file a report about this threat. Please inform me immediately once you have taken care of it." He pauses, then continues, "Oh, and remember to record the battle. It may be useful in understanding what they are doing there."`
	"CN-16623" `As you spot the Korath hunters, you recall Plume's request and tap the "Record" button as your ship prepares for combat.`
	"CN-16624" `When you return to <planet>, you find Plume waiting for you. He eagerly reviews the recording of the combat. "Thank you for eliminating this hunter-" he is interrupted by a flashing light on his commlink. He briefly reads something, and then looks back up to you. "Apparently, something about the Korath hunting the void sprites has concerned the defense prefect. Chilia has requested that you meet with him on Caelian immediately."`
	"CN-16625" `The <ship> has barely come to a rest on its designated pad when your panel begins blinking with a request for permission to come aboard. A glance at the viewscreen shows a fit young man with a military bearing standing at your airlock. You quickly check with the starport control and confirm that the prefect in charge of Remnant military activities is indeed waiting to board your ship. You hit the unlock button and watch as Prefect Chilia strides onboard.`
	"CN-16626" `	"Greetings, Captain <first>," he signs. "I am Prefect Chilia. I have the nominal responsibility for the overall defense of Remnant space and military operations." He smiles deprecatingly. "I say 'nominal' as virtually all our activities are military in some way, but usually fall under the purview of those who better understand them."`
	"CN-16627" `The <ship> has barely come to a rest on its designated pad when your panel begins blinking with a request for permission to come aboard. A quick glance at the viewscreen shows Prefect Chilia standing at your airlock. You quickly hit the unlock button and watch as he strides onboard.`
	"CN-16628" `	"Greetings, Captain <first>," he signs. "You seem to have a knack for finding things of importance to us. I am glad, however, that you and Plume discovered this."`
	"CN-16629" `	His gestures take on an abrupt cadence without many of the normal connecting movements that you are accustomed to. "Now, for the task at hand: it seems the Korath have discovered the void sprites and shot at enough of them that almost all have retreated into the depths of Nasqueron and Slylandro. There are military implications of the Korath harvesting void sprites, and we must take steps to prevent this from happening.`
	"CN-16630" `	His gestures take on an abrupt cadence without many of the normal connecting movements that you are accustomed to. "Now, for the task at hand: It seems the Korath have discovered the void sprites, and shot at enough of them that almost all have retreated into the depths of Nasqueron and Slylandro. You are aware of the potential military implications of the Korath harvesting void sprites and must realize the importance of stopping this.`
	"CN-16631" `	"It is imperative that all the Korath involved in this exploration be located immediately. According to our surveillance, that ship was part of a fleet that recently passed through Parca. Locate the fleet and report back."`
	"CN-16632" `You've destroyed the Korath fleet that was harassing the void sprites.`
	"CN-16633" `This time, as you complete your post-flight checks you spot Prefect Chilia exiting the Starling next to you and watch as he strides across the pad to your airlock. You hit the open button as he clambers up the ladder. Without a word you pull up the sensor logs from Aescolanus, highlighting the position of the various ships. His eyes flit over the display for a moment, then he nods.`
	"CN-16634" `	"I will notify a task force. Meet me in the spaceport, and make sure your ship is ready to fight."`
	"CN-16635" `	As he departs from your ship, your commlink beeps with a message that an organization by the name of "Remnant Logistics" has allocated you an additional <payment>.`
	"CN-16636" `	"You have demonstrated good initiative; however, I suspect that it was not the only hunter fleet out there. I will notify a task force. Meet me in the spaceport, and make sure your ship is ready to fight."`
	"CN-16637" `When you arrive in the spaceport, you find Prefect Chilia in the middle of briefing a group of Remnant. He waves you forward as soon as you approach and introduces you to the briefing. "Everyone, this is Captain <last>, who has located the Korath hunters twice now and will take the lead on tracking the rest for this mission." As you cross the room to join him, you take a good look at the group. One detail that stands out to you is that every one of the Remnant in this group is wearing a thick leather wrap around their necks, which extends up to their hairline. The leather has a scaly texture, and it appears to be pulsing faintly. Unfortunately, you do not have time to ask questions, as Chilia has not stopped issuing instructions.`
	"CN-16638" `When you arrive in the spaceport, you find Prefect Chilia in the middle of briefing a group of Remnant. He waves you forward as soon as you approach and introduces you to the briefing. "Everyone, this is Captain <last>, who has located the Korath hunters twice now and recently destroyed part of their fleet. The Captain will take the lead on tracking the rest for this mission." As you cross the room to join him, you take a good look at the group. One detail that stands out to you is that every one of the Remnant in this group is wearing a thick leather wrap around their necks, which extends up to their hairline. The leather has a scaly texture, and it appears to be pulsing faintly. Unfortunately, you do not have time to ask questions, as Chilia has not stopped issuing instructions.`
	"CN-16639" `	He turns to you. "These are the captains who will be following your lead. They are flying two Albatrosses, two Ibises with full complements, and six Starlings. One of the Albatrosses is outfitted to act as a shield; let it take the brunt of attacks." He pauses, looking around at the group. "This task force would be overkill for the intended target, but we are not taking any chances: make sure every Korath there is killed. Salvage is secondary: priority is making sure there are no escapees."`
	"CN-16640" `	He steps back and looks at the group. "May the Embers burn bright for you." With that, he gives the group a respectful nod and walks away. The captains all look around and make various signs you think are probably encouraging combat pilot slang and variations on Prefect Chilia's parting words. As they disperse to their ships, one gestures to you. "Lead on, Captain."`
	"CN-16641" `The task force streams back into <planet> without fanfare, its ships settling onto their landing pads with a sense of satisfaction. Within seconds, mechanics are climbing the hulls, and engineers drop from the ceiling on tethers to inspect the engines. Batteries are plugged in, fuel lines connected, and carts with replacement weaponry roll in. As always, the first responsibility of every captain is to ensure that their ship is ready to return to space for whenever it's needed. As the first footsteps echo on the hull of the <ship>, you switch the ship into maintenance mode before heading to the spaceport.`
	"CN-16642" `You find Prefect Chilia and the rest of the captains gathered in a small side room off the main cafeteria. Everyone is digging into their customarily enormous meals while the prefect works the room, talking with everyone. As you pull up a chair, Chilia appears next to you and slides a tray in front of you. "It might not be the sort of fare you are used to from the ancestral worlds," he says, "but it is what we have to offer." Chilia looks around at everyone eating in muted conversation. "It is something of a tradition to eat a meal together when returning from battle. Share memories of those who fall, talk about why they fell, and what we must do differently next time." He eats a few bites from his own plate.`
	"CN-16643" `	"So, what should we do differently next time?"`
	"CN-16644" `	"A few more Albatrosses would have been great."`
	"CN-16645" `	"The EMPs kept getting in the way."`
	"CN-16646" `	"I think that went fairly well, actually."`
	"CN-16647" `	He writes something on his notepad. "I appreciate the feedback." He pauses and sips from his glass. "Now, moving forward, we need to know what the Korath are doing. Beyond the obvious of killing void sprites and picking fights with the Archon, the Korath are a cunning foe, and they would not antagonize the Archon for no reason," he says.`
	"CN-16648" `	"I have to look into a few things here. In the meantime, please go pick up Plume from <stopovers> and bring him back. We need him to be here for a briefing before <day>."`
	"CN-16649" `Plume is waiting for you at the landing pad. Once you have given the all-clear and opened the doors, he boards with little fanfare. "Thanks for dealing with the Korath, Captain <last>. They had me worried." With that, he settles into a bunk and starts reviewing his notes.`
	"CN-16650" `As soon as you land, Plume scurries off to find Chilia. By the time you finish your shutdown checks and head to where the meeting is taking place, you find that Plume has almost finished the briefing already. You catch the last few minutes summarizing what materials might be concentrated within the void sprites and his speculation that the Korath may have decided that these semi-processed resources are useful to their survival, despite the hostility of the Archon.`
	"CN-16651" `	After a few minutes of questions and answers about void sprite physiology and speculation by the assembled Remnant pilots, Chilia calls for a recess. "We will reconvene shortly to discuss the implications of this, but there are tasks to be done in the meantime. Captain <first>, meet me in the spaceport."`
	"CN-16652" `	As everyone disperses towards the spaceport, your commlink notifies you that you have received what the message terms "a resource offset allotment of <payment> from Remnant Logistics."`
	"CN-16653" `In the starport, Prefect Chilia and Plume are gesturing at some details on a datapad when you approach. Chilia notices you first and waves you over. "Thank you for joining us. While I put together some more long-term plans, could you take Plume to <planet>?"`
	"CN-16654" `	"Why do we need to go back?"`
	"CN-16655" `	"Let's go."`
	"CN-16656" `	"Recordings and sensor readings are useful data, but they don't really compare to actually seeing what is going on and experiencing the data firsthand." says Plume. "There aren't too many opportunities to do it in my line of work - especially when my expertise is needed by others who would rather not spend their time watching wildlife. But I digress."`
	"CN-16657" `	With a respectful bow to Chilia (who returns it equally respectfully), Plume heads for your ship. "I will be waiting onboard for you, Captain."`
	"CN-16658" `Descending into the clouds of Nasqueron is becoming almost familiar to you. Wispy layers of gas give way to more voluminous formations and the occasional turbulent storm. Beside you, Plume is eagerly peering out the window, and you remind yourself that this may well be his first time actually seeing void sprites on their world.`
	"CN-16659" `	You reach the altitude where void sprites have previously been found in the greatest concentration before activating your ship's sensors. Plume looks around, peering out the windows. "Where are they? Aren't there usually some around? They always seemed plentiful in the recordings." You focus on the sensors, and after a few minutes pick up some distant contacts. You follow them down into the lower atmosphere and eventually begin to detect some void sprites.`
	"CN-16660" `	"That's close enough, Captain," says Plume. "I will go outside and watch them from the hull." You help him into a pressure suit and cycle the airlock behind him. You quickly suppress a brief feeling of disappointment. "This is, after all, Plume's job," you say to yourself as you settle back into your chair to wait for him to return.`
	"CN-16661" `Plume returns to the ship after several hours, spurred by alarms in his suit warning you both of low oxygen levels. As you help him out of the pressure suit, he looks like he is having trouble deciding if he should be thrilled or worried.`
	"CN-16662" `	"It is wonderful to be here, watching them from a distance. A few did venture close, too. But I'm worried about them. Some of the void sprites out there have scorch marks similar to the scoring left by Korath weapons. And we already noticed that they are hiding much deeper in the atmosphere than normal." He glances down at his datapad then back up at you. "Once we are back into the chaos of the Ember Waste, I will send Chilia a signal. It looks like I will need to double-check my records and samples back on Aventine. Please take me there."`
	"CN-16663" `As you approach Aventine, Plume gestures toward the pad closest to his lab. "You might as well set down there. If the samples in my lab check out, I will have another mission for you right away. You will need to keep your high-pressure ship active for this one. Stop by the lab in an hour or two and we will be ready to start loading."`
	"CN-16664" `You walk into Plume's lab and are greeted by a large stack of crates and equipment. Plume and another Remnant are gathered around the stack, checking items off a list. "Ah, <first>! Good timing. We were just finishing the inventory of supplies that need to go on this delivery." He gestures to the engineer. "This is Gavriil, one of our best technologists and a skilled astrobiologist in their own right. They will be going with you."`
	"CN-16665" `	"It will be a pleasure to work with you," signs Gavriil, making a short bow. "We will be traveling to a research station on <planet>. Yes, it is a gas giant." They smile at that. "I have to get some equipment set up and get the core systems online. There will be a few more loads of materials afterwards." They look askance at you. "Shall we get started?"`
	"CN-16666" `Gavriil gives you precise directions to a set of coordinates that your sensors tell you is an empty area, and when you reach the designated spot, you see a small station shimmering out of the clouds.`
	"CN-16667" `	"We never managed to actually cloak the station," the engineer explains, grinning. "But we managed to hide it very effectively against every form of scanning we knew of. We even managed to give it a cloak-like field that renders it mostly transparent."`
	"CN-16668" `	They nod approvingly. "It's rather impressive what my predecessors managed to do with what they had back then."`
	"CN-16669" `	"Let's get on with it."`
	"CN-16670" `	"Well, this place is fairly old. It was built shortly after we learned how to build Starlings - which is where we learned of the troubles of extending the cloaking field beyond small ships. I don't know the mechanics behind it, but it has taken close to two centuries of study and development for cloaks to be feasible on large ships. We had plenty of Puffins back then, and the techniques for building high-pressure systems were well understood. The Alphas hadn't shown any interest in gas giants or 'gaslined ships' as we call them, so having somewhere like this to hide in makes sense. Best place to hide is somewhere no one will look, right?" With that, they nod to themself, climb to their feet, and head towards the suit locker.`
	"CN-16671" `	"The station should be pressurized with a normal atmosphere, but it has been running on standby for ages with just yearly maintenance. It is time to get this place up and running again." With two of you operating your ship's loading equipment, everything is transferred in short order. You notice that the last crate includes a substantial amount of field rations and survival gear. It looks like Gavriil is planning on staying here for a while.`
	"CN-16672" `	As they head off deeper into the station, you receive a notification that "Remnant Logistics" has made a deposit of <payment> to your account.`
	"CN-16673" `As you look around this eerily silent station, you get a message on your commlink: Plume requests that you pick up another technician and <tons> of equipment from <stopovers> and bring them back to <origin>.`
	"CN-16674" `Flight control gives you directions to a landing pad that already has a large pile of crates stacked next to it. As you land, workers swarm out to help load the equipment. Once everything is stowed, a young technician climbs aboard, stows their gear, and lets you know that everything is ready for departure. You shake your head, impressed at how quickly the Remnant make things happen when projects start to move.`
	"CN-16675" `On the flight over, the technician joins you on the control deck to chat. She's a biotech specialist, adept at managing life-support systems in alien atmospheres, and a recent graduate from a Remnant educational program that seems to be similar to a university. Apparently she studied astrobiology and is part of a project aimed at supporting mutually exclusive environments in close proximity. She spends nearly an hour excitedly telling you the ins and outs of the station.`
	"CN-16676" `	As you approach <planet>, it occurs to you that the Remnant might appreciate you taking steps to maintain the secrecy of the station. Altering the <ship>'s path slightly, you swing down into <planet> in an oblique path then meander around the planet under the cloud layer until arriving at the station. Your passenger nods approvingly as she notices the flight path. "Secrecy is always good with projects like this. We appreciate the extra effort, and if anyone were to follow you, a path like that through the clouds would leave few signs to spot."`
	"CN-16677" `	The <ship> settles into the landing bay, and the technician quickly disembarks. Apparently there must have been other shipments while you were gone, as there are now a handful of people visible and quite a bit more equipment stacked everywhere. The station itself feels more alive, the air fresher. As before, you promptly receive notification of another payment of <payment> to your account.`
	"CN-16678" `As you finish unloading, you spot Gavriil approaching. They gesture in greeting as they approach. "Thanks for the delivery. We've got standard logistics routes set up now for the rest." They pause and fish a data crystal out of a pouch. "Could you take this to Prefect Taely on <planet>? She is overseeing some retrofits and will need this data."`
	"CN-16679" `On Viminal, you easily locate the maintenance yards. You ask around for Prefect Taely and are eventually directed towards a solidly built woman working on a Pelican. She spots you approaching and frees herself from the machinery. "Greetings, Captain <last>, I am Prefect Taely. I understand you have something for me." You hand her the data crystal. "This must contain the detailed chemical analysis and profiles," she says. She slots it into her console and taps a few commands. "Okay, I just need to incorporate these profiles into the system and make a few more adjustments. Meet me in the spaceport cafeteria in a couple hours."`
	"CN-16680" `On Viminal, you easily locate the maintenance yards and eventually find Taely buried in a Pelican. She spots you approaching and frees herself from the machinery. "Greetings, <first>. How is our station faring?" You reply that it is improving rapidly and hand her the data crystal. "Ah, good. This must contain the detailed chemical analysis and profiles," she says. She slots it into her console and taps a few commands. "Okay, I just need to incorporate these profiles into the system and make a few more adjustments. Meet me in the spaceport cafeteria in a couple hours."`
	"CN-16681" `In the cafeteria, you are met by Taely and several other captains. "Thank you for joining us," she signs. "The goal of this mission is to travel to Nasqueron together with equipment designed to harvest some atmosphere from the void sprites' worlds before bringing it back to Esquiline. The equipment on the Puffins will collect, compress, and store the gas, which you can offload to specially prepared tanks on the Pelican. Then proceed to <planet> and offload what you have collected to the station."`
	"CN-16682" `	She turns to face the group of captains and gestures with tones of respect. "May the Embers bring interest to your journey."`
	"CN-16683" `	She nods at you and continues. "The Penguin will be even better than the Puffin for this task, and you are welcome to use her, but we do not have any available to accompany you. Continuing to rely on Puffins is not ideal, but we will make do with what we have." She turns to face the group of captains and gestures with tones of respect. "May the Embers bring interest to your journey."`
	"CN-16684" `You cruise through the atmosphere at a relaxed pace, waiting while the equipment does its work. You see fewer void sprites than usual, and many have scars. Once the equipment indicates that it has reached capacity, you climb up to where the Pelican is waiting in the high atmosphere, hook up the connections to offload the gas, and then head back down into the depths of the planet. After several hours, the captain of the Pelican informs you that the tanks are full, and it is time to head to <planet>.`
	"CN-16685" `You arrive at the hidden station on <planet> where Gavriil is waiting to offload the atmospheric gases. Their team quickly hooks the Puffins up to ports on the bay walls, and hidden equipment starts pumping their contents into the system. After a few minutes, they disconnect the ships, and you and the Puffins head up to the Pelican to refill your reservoirs and ferry it down to the station.`
	"CN-16686" `	As the last load starts to empty into the station, another tech comes up to you. "Captain, we just received a message from Prefect Chilia. He would like you to meet him on Viminal as soon as possible." You nod and start to run checks on the <ship>, making ready to leave once the cargo is done unloading.`
	"CN-16687" `You land by the starport and are immediately accosted by a Remnant who informs you that Prefect Chilia is on his personal warship and escorts you to a nearby Starling. Inside you find Chilia and several other Remnant clustered around a holographic display and some display panels. "Ah, Captain. Join us, please." Chilia gestures for you to join them around the displays. As you approach, you note that the holographic display shows the Ember Waste, although there are a few details that do not match the star maps you're familiar with.`
	"CN-16688" `	Chilia notices you eyeing the deviations. "Perceptive, Captain. Our sensors have reported some unusual energy signatures coming from this location. Scouts in the area say they are picking up signs of a new system. There were no immediately apparent hyperlinks or wormholes that connect to it, but there are still unusual energy fluctuations in the area. Unusual even for the Ember Waste." He looks up at you. "We are hoping that you might be able to figure out a way in."`
	"CN-16689" `	"I could see if I can reach it with a jump drive."`
	"CN-16690" `	"I will see if I can find another way."`
	"CN-16691" `	"Thank you, Captain <first>. We have some ships that can follow, and there are other scouts already in the area that should be reporting soon. Given your experience with the wider galaxy, though, we would like you to lead the way."`
	"CN-16692" `As your ship's sensors re-establish their depiction of the system around you, an alien space station comes into view. It appears to be old and mostly inactive, but your sensors do pick up occasional bursts of energy - and, oddly, faint signs of life almost everywhere.`
	"CN-16693" `Surprisingly, the station is still operational, despite its apparent age. Ancient environmental systems maintain a breathable atmosphere, although it is thinner than you find comfortable. Likewise, the air is cool - but not dangerously so. Everywhere you look, you continually feel like you have stumbled upon a space station built by giants: doors are massive, controls are placed at head height, and displays seem to be angled for a being significantly taller than you. Most unusually, larger rooms often have what look to be benches and tables placed halfway up walls.`
	"CN-16694" `	The engineering of the station points to a dedicated construction program aimed at a single purpose. You trace some of the more obvious sets of cables and discover a large spherical chamber in the station's core filled with arcane machinery. It emits significant amounts of unknown energy - enough that your suit's medical systems emphatically warn you to turn back. While the devices appear to be central to this station's purpose, they will have to remain a mystery for now. Clearly, this is the sort of thing that the Remnant sent you out to find, and they will want to know about it as soon as possible.`
	"CN-16695" `As you arrive back at Viminal, you broadcast a warning to the port authorities that something is following you. You inform them that it is not hostile, but it is an unknown entity that originated in the new system.`
	"CN-16696" `Quite a number of Remnant have gathered around the spaceport watching the movements of the strange creature. It gestures wildly in various ways, then freezes in several different positions with the tips of certain tentacles glowing with energy. You note that several anti-air batteries around the area have their formidable-looking weapons trained on the creature in case it turns violent.`
	"CN-16697" `	After several hours of watching the creature, one captain pushes his way forward to where you, Chilia, and Plume are talking. "I think I have an idea about this thing, Prefect!" the man signs excitedly. "Look at the positions of the glowing tips when it freezes. That pattern there matches the star positions of the main Ember Waste systems when viewed from Peragenor, and that second matches Convector." He pulls out a datapad and pulls up a projection of the starmap. "It is hard to tell due to the imprecision, but it looks like the third freeze is probably Antevorta or Nenia."`
	"CN-16698" `	Plume chimes in, "If those freezes indicate star positions, then the flying and landing behavior in between them may be indicating that it wants you to travel there. Please give it a try. Make sure to take a 'gaslined' ship; if the third system is Nenia, it may want you to enter the gas giants."`
	"CN-16699" `You follow the creature down through the clouds of Nasqueron and emerge into what can only be described as an amphitheater in the clouds. Thousands of void sprites fill the area, and the creature you have been following floats near the center of it. Your external sensors pick up myriad pulses of energy and eerie whistling noises that seem to resonate in the clouds. As the <ship> moves forward, there is a sudden silence, and the flickers of energy synchronize.`
	"CN-16700" `	You feel a sudden pressure in your mind and a sense of presence as the world around you fades out somewhat.`
	"CN-16701" `	"Know you not, do I. Live creature inside not-quite creature, like ones who flew but not everywhere." You are momentarily disoriented as you look around and see hundreds of views of yourself peering out the cockpit window. "Your intention reverberates - Know and not know - Return with more echoes - Perhaps I shall hear."`
	"CN-16702" `	With that, the pressure vanishes, and you are left staring out the window at the rapidly dispersing flock of void sprites. You aren't entirely sure what the voice meant, but you are certain that the Remnant are going to want to hear about this.`
	"CN-16703" `It is almost starting to feel commonplace to have Remnant pouncing on your ship and using your bridge as a meeting room. This time, it is Prefect Chilia and Plume who seem to appear out of nowhere requesting permission to board. The two gather around your console to watch the recording of your trip. They nod at your narration of what transpired and focus intently when you describe the strange presence in your mind. When you finish recounting your experience, they lean back in thought.`
	"CN-16704" `	"Captain <first>, the exact meaning is unclear, but it seems to be the voice of something not accustomed to speaking to us or creatures like us," signs Prefect Chilia. "While interesting, I think we should move forward with our plan and continue investigating this later." Plume reluctantly signs his agreement as Chilia continues. "Best case scenario, we can deprive the Korath of easy access to the void sprites. Worst case scenario, we can move enough that should the Korath hunt them to extinction in Nenia, they will continue to exist in our territory."`
	"CN-16705" `	Plume signals his cautious agreement. "This message is intriguing, but I agree it should not be our first priority. That being said, I will plan for additional investigations after we have completed this initial operation."`
	"CN-16706" `	The two look at you, and Chilia authoritatively signs, "We are evacuating a large group of void sprites from Nenia to Esquiline. The atmospheres are largely a match, and we have reconfigured the station to provide the nutrients that aren't otherwise present. We have a fleet of Pelicans that have basically been hollowed out so we can lure as many void sprites into it as we can."`
	"CN-16707" `	"How are we supposed to lure them inside?"`
	"CN-16708" `	"Are we sure this is a good idea?"`
	"CN-16709" `	"Okay, let's go do this."`
	"CN-16710" `	Plume looks a bit embarrassed. "When we first studied the void sprites centuries ago, we learned how to harvest them. As part of that, we discovered that they were particularly interested in certain types of radiation. Likewise, if they discovered a certain kind of element common in some asteroids, they would ignore almost everything while they chewed on it. So, we have emitters inside the cargo holds along with asteroids to keep them busy for a short while."`
	"CN-16711" `	Chilia signs with a resolute tone. "Is it a good idea? Maybe, maybe not. Is it the best idea we have so far? Yes." He sighs. "I fully expect the Archon to interfere: they do have long memories. As best we can tell, they can pick out who is leading a fleet, so you should expect them to talk to you. That is, if they do not simply start shooting, anyway."`
	"CN-16712" `	Chilia continues. "You don't need to actually land anywhere in Nenia this time, Captain. Just make sure the Pelicans get there, load up, and return safely." The two stand up and get ready to leave. "May the Embers burn bright for you, Captain." With that, they disembark and quickly clear the blast area around the landing pad. Around you a large group of Pelicans are warming up, each one synchronizing to your IFF and confirming their status.`
	"CN-16713" `Moments later a ping comes in on the commlink, and Prefect Chilia appears on screen accompanied by Plume. Plume gestures first. "Thank you for your work, Captain. It is unclear what the results of this effort will be, but for now, we wait and see. Hopefully the void sprites settle in," he concludes.`
	"CN-16714" `	"In the meantime," continues Chilia, "We are allocating you a daily stipend from our resources to cover some of your ongoing crew, maintenance, and upgrading costs. A larger one-time allotment has already been credited to your account with the shipyard facilities to help cover costs incurred during this mission."`
	"CN-16715" `As you finish your landing checks, your commlink notifies you of an incoming message from Dawn:`
	"CN-16716" `	"Greetings, Captain <first>! We will be compiling updated navigational charts for the new systems and would like a fresh copy of the data your nav system recorded. We are hoping to retrieve some additional data that is not routinely downloaded by the automated starport systems. Stop by <planet>, and the starport systems will copy the data during the systems check. It's a pretty small data set, so there's no need to use data crystals. Thank you!"`
	"CN-16717" `	The end of the message is the location of a starport on <planet>, presumably where you are supposed to go.`
	"CN-16718" `The crowd inside the spaceport cafeteria is an excited flurry of movement. You squeeze through a gap in the crowd to discover that they are gathered around a holoprojector displaying footage of the strange creature that recently followed you to Viminal and then on to Nenia. From the snippets of conversation that you catch, it appears that they are discussing theories about it. Almost as soon as you arrive, however, the gestures still and one of the Remnant gestures to you. "Greetings, Seeker. You are the one who found this creature. Since you traveled with it, could you share more recordings of it?"`
	"CN-16719" `	"Definitely."`
	"CN-16720" `	A few commands on your commlink later, and recordings your ship automatically made from its sensors while in flight pop up on a second projector. Several others pull up their commlinks and start skimming over the attached sensor logs. Almost immediately, one waves to get everyone's attention.`
	"CN-16721" `	"Captain, was there anything unusual when you arrived there?"`
	"CN-16722" `	"Yes, sensors reported life signs."`
	"CN-16723" `	"I don't remember. Did you notice something?"`
	"CN-16724" `	One of the Remnant pulls up the relevant section and puts it up on the projector. "Right here, the logs show that there are ambient life-signs all over the system, but nothing of significance shows up on the physical scanners." He frowns at the projector. "All the equipment status signals in the records are nominal, and both the check digits and data hashes match."`
	"CN-16725" `	"So there are no problems with the data?"`
	"CN-16726" `	"Skip the technical jargon. What does it mean?"`
	"CN-16727" `	Another Remnant nods. "Exactly. There is no problem with the data or the equipment, so one way or another, this is what it recorded. As such, either there is something here which we have never seen before, or there is something causing problems with conventional sensors." He looks around at the gathered Remnant and pauses as if focusing on something you cannot see or hear, then turns to you. "We have reached a consensus.`
	"CN-16728" `	The Remnant pauses for a moment to adjust what they were about to say before continuing. "What it means is that there is no obvious explanation for why there would be life signs out there." They glance around at the rest of the gathered Remnant then back to you.`
	"CN-16729" `	"We would like you to take a team of five researchers and their equipment to Ssil Vida. Can you do that?"`
	"CN-16730" `	"That sounds reasonable."`
	"CN-16731" `	"You aren't a prefect. How can you make a decision like that?"`
	"CN-16732" `	Before he can respond, another Remnant answers. "The Prefects are not the sole source of decisions. One could say that they are the 'executive' authority that can make on-the-spot decisions, whereas the Remnant as a whole makes what one might term 'legislative' decision making. The scope of our decisions as a group are limited based on the size of the group making the decision."`
	"CN-16733" `	"That makes sense."`
	"CN-16734" `	"Why do you need multiple methods of decision making?"`
	"CN-16735" `	"Because we are in the midst of war, and located in an actively hazardous part of the galaxy. We, as a people, need to make countless thousands of on-the-spot decisions every day. If we had to reach a consensus for every troop movement, expedition, or resource allocation we would be overwhelmed within days." She stops speaking, and another Remnant picks up the explanation.`
	"CN-16736" `	"By the same token, prefects can be killed, or overloaded. Having as much decision making as possible handled by the Remnant as a group reduces our vulnerability to assassination strikes, and helps protect our prefects from burning out under the responsibility. On the flip side, it also protects our society from becoming an autocracy where one powerful person or small group makes all the decisions."`
	"CN-16737" `	The Remnant become still and look at you. "So, will you take this mission?"`
	"CN-16738" `	"Later."`
	"CN-16739" `	"Excellent. We will load our equipment racks on-board, and the equipment to go in them will be waiting for you on pad D43A on <stopovers>. Once it is loaded, return here to pick up the team of researchers who will be going with you. Remember, you will need 5 bunks free as well as an on-board Research Laboratory to complement our equipment."`
	"CN-16740" `	"Oh, that is unfortunate. Maybe some other time, then." The crowd makes various gestures of disappointment, and turn back to observing the projection and discussing their theories.`
	"CN-16741" `You land on pad D43A and sure enough, there is a team waiting to load a bunch of equipment into the racks. Within minutes they are done loading, and they cheerfully wave to you as they head off.`
	"CN-16742" `According to your log, you are where you need to be, but something is missing. The mission checklist blinks quietly at you on the side of your console, reminding you that you need to have a Research Laboratory installed, and that the requested equipment must be in-system. If you have more than one ship, it might not have arrived yet.`
	"CN-16743" `One of the Remnant is waiting for you. "Thanks for picking up the equipment. The team that you will be taking to Ssil Vida is waiting for you in the spaceport."`
	"CN-16744" `One of the Remnant is waiting for you. "Thanks for picking up the equipment. Dusk will lead the team that you will take to Ssil Vida, but we understand he is currently busy elsewhere with you. You should complete that work, then return to the spaceport here to begin the next expedition."`
	"CN-16745" `In the cafeteria the scene hasn't changed much: there is still a large group of Remnant gathered around a cluster of projectors, with a constant stream of gestures discussing various points of the data. You understand enough to figure out that most of the conversation is deep into technical discussions of how the lifesign sensors might give the readings they do without having anything visible. The principal difference from before is the presence of five pressure-suited Remnant with a neat stack of equipment topped with helmets. One of them notices you and waves you over. "Captain <first>! My name is Dusk, and I am one of the researchers that you volunteered to transport to Ssil Vida."`
	"CN-16746" `	"Pleased to meet you, Dusk."`
	"CN-16747" `	In the cafeteria the scene hasn't changed much: There is still a large group of Remnant gathered around a cluster of projectors, with a constant stream of gestures discussing various points of the data. You understand enough to figure out that most of the conversation is deep into technical discussions of how the lifesign sensors might give the readings they do without having anything visible. The principal difference from before is the presence of five pressure-suited Remnant with a neat stack of equipment topped with helmets. You recognize one of them as Dusk as he waves you over. "Captain <first>! The Embers crossed our paths once again. I am one of the researchers that you have volunteered to transport to Ssil Vida."`
	"CN-16748" `	"Good to see you again, Dusk."`
	"CN-16749" `	"I was meaning to ask: are names like that common?"`
	"CN-16750" `	"You mean names of the various phases of daylight?" He pauses for a few seconds. "I would not say they are common, but nor are they rare, either. Our ancestors devoted their lives, one way or another, to studying the stars and the ever-changing light of the universe. It should not be surprising that their vocabulary should be so entwined in our culture."`
	"CN-16751" `	"Who were your ancestors?"`
	"CN-16752" `	"Interesting. Well, what is our mission?"`
	"CN-16753" `	Dusk looks thoughtful for a moment. "Our ancestors came from a different era for humanity. They were the heirs of a golden age of human scientific development and progress, when governments and institutions poured vast wealth into science. The developments of that time period resulted in the completion of the hyperspace relay network, new terraforming techniques, and advanced genetic engineering capabilities." His face clouds at that. "This, of course, culminated in the Alphas." He pauses, then shakes his head. "But you asked who our ancestors were, not about human history.`
	"CN-16754" `	"In that era there were a number of burgeoning astronomy and exploration programs across human space. Despite also benefiting from the substantial budget increases that science in general was receiving, they were being pushed to the margins of the academic community: unlike many of the more practical sciences like biology and chemistry which were coming up with new wonders, astronomy and astrophysics was purely academic. There was no budget in explaining the whys of the universe, not when other scientists were creating homo superior and unleashing instantaneous interstellar communication.`
	"CN-16755" `	"So they banded together. It was not, I gather from the records, an unusual thing for academics of a particular field to meet with others of their field. If one faculty could not fund an expedition, perhaps two different faculties working together could. Eventually they formed a loose organization, a sort of 'standing conference' on astronomy and astrophysics, through which they met to discuss, debate, and organize."`
	"CN-16756" `	"Your ancestors were originally a scientific conference?"`
	"CN-16757" `	"Thanks for the background. So, what is our mission?"`
	"CN-16758" `	Several of the Remnant nod, and another signs, "They gathered together to talk of their science, and each brought with them the captains and crew who enabled them. Some of those captains brought with them resources, too. Who else would appreciate learning of the void as much as those who ply their trades across it?`
	"CN-16759" `	"The association grew over time, although as best we can tell from our records it made an effort to remain both politically and economically neutral. As such, it remained comparatively small and close-knit. Many of our ancestors have told stories about calling themselves the 'Exploration Vector,' alluding to the fact that they were the one subset of humanity on a course to head out into the furthest reaches of space. They even held contests about who could go the furthest from inhabited space, or who could spend the longest time between resupply stops.`
	"CN-16760" `	"When the war against the Alphas started, it was these people who had the most knowledge and experience with the farthest reaches of space. While many outfitters might sell a captain a map showing the hyperjumps a few systems into the uninhabited territories, it was our ancestors who had spent years living in those systems while they did their research. Thus they were the ones who got the jobs running supplies, or flying reconnaissance. They saw first-hand the way the war was going. They made the rendezvous and picked up the equipment drops, and they grew increasingly worried."`
	"CN-16761" `	"They were worried about the course the war was taking?"`
	"CN-16762" `	"That would be worrisome. We should focus on the mission."`
	"CN-16763" `	Dusk starts gesturing again. "Yes, but also by what they saw. Strange ships that slipped over the horizon, odd energy signatures in the distance, novel equipment that simply showed up on Deep ships without explanation... It seemed like someone out there was taking advantage of the chaos to influence humanity. Someone beyond the reach of the normal hyperspace network. It spurred our ancestors to revisit old theories and kindle new ones. Knowing that there was someone, something beyond what we knew made us bold. It was not long before the first ship traveled through the wormhole."`
	"CN-16764" `	"Which ship was that?"`
	"CN-16765" `	"I think I can see where this is going. Time to get to work."`
	"CN-16766" `	Dusk smiles. "The Shadow Step, an independent science vessel who did double-duty as a gas miner. She made a quiet fortune harvesting rarer gases from obscure gas planets off the charted paths. Never enough to attract the attention of the big corporate entities, but enough to be comfortable. Her captain was always making modifications. Not a genius by any means, but what they lacked in brilliance, they made up for in dedication and willingness to experiment. According to our records, making modifications to the Shadow Step was their main hobby, and the small crew they flew with had similar interests." Dusk pauses to take a drink.`
	"CN-16767" `	"Thanks to the bravery of the Shadow Step and her crew, the hard work of the researchers that worked with them, and the contributions of a vast number of other ships and teams, the way out was discovered." Dusk signs this last with a note of finality, and many of the Remnant who were listening make the sign for "respect" and "together."`
	"CN-16768" `	Dusk smiles and signs apologetically. "My apologies for being overly detailed. I found the study of our ancestors to be an intriguing one, so I have spent much time searching out my families' history. That, in turn, has led to a detailed interest in the early years of our society." Dusk gestures towards the holographic projection of Ssil Vida. "But enough of history, the present calls to us."`
	"CN-16769" `	Dusk leans over the holo, peering at the details. "The mission is a very standard arc: we go to the station, set up our equipment to get some detailed readings, and return here once we are done. For these initial readings we should need about a day onsite, and we will leave some of our equipment to take ongoing recordings for retrieval later. After that... well, we will see what the data says and decide from there."`
	"CN-16770" `Dusk and the team of scientists waste no time in getting to work: they have the preliminary sensors working almost from the moment you leave the spaceport, and by the time you dock with Ssil Vida they have all their equipment arranged to quickly offload and set up. With the space cleared, they expand the Research Laboratory and set to work analyzing the system. Before long they are clustered around displays and adjusting sensor readings, deep in discussion. Eventually, Dusk strides over to you. "Everything is set up and proceeding nominally, Captain. We will need a few hours to complete the measurements. You do not need to stand around watching, although you are welcome to if you like." Dusk heads back over to check on one of the devices.`
	"CN-16771" `	(Return to the <ship> and prepare for departure.)`
	"CN-16772" `	(Ask if I can help with their work.)`
	"CN-16773" `	(Explore Ssil Vida.)`
	"CN-16774" `	You pick up some instruments, recording equipment, and wayfinding labels, then check the map tracking the other Remnant researchers. Picking an unexplored direction, you set off.`
	"CN-16775" `	The first few corridors are marked with labels indicating the direction that other explorers traveled, and so you easily find your way into unexplored territory. As you explore the empty corridors, your early impressions of scale are reinforced by the massive doors and significant distances between them. Glancing inside, you find room after room containing large platforms. Each platform is lightly padded with several bars along each side, and what appears to be a storage locker set into it at the end. Based on your experience, you realize that these resemble storage platforms used to secure delicate cargo, but there is no indication of what that cargo might be.`
	"CN-16776" `	Further exploration reveals considerably more oversized rooms, including one with vast amounts of storage lockers and freezers. You note that the rooms you search appear to be fairly well organized, so you conclude that whatever happened to this station either did not cause a panic, or someone else cleaned up afterwards. After a few hours of exploring you head back to the main area.`
	"CN-16777" `	You follow Dusk over to the equipment, and ask if there is anything you can do to help. He looks surprised, but pleased. After thinking about it for a moment, he asks you if you can help monitor some diagnostics and do some preventative maintenance on some of the equipment. Over the following few hours, Dusk keeps you involved in the work, occasionally explaining what the various pieces of equipment do. The rest of the team quickly follows suit, and before long you feel like part of the team. By the time Dusk starts wrapping up the observations you have started to pick up some of the scientific vocabulary, along with a few of the basics behind how the equipment works.`
	"CN-16778" `	You help pack up the equipment, then head back to the main room where Dusk and several others are gathered.`
	"CN-16779" `	You head back to the <ship> and run through all the preliminary checks to get ready for the trip back to <destination>. You quickly finish the checks, along with some preventative maintenance, and end up spending a few hours relaxing while you wait for Dusk and his team to finish their studies.`
	"CN-16780" `	Eventually you get a message from Dusk indicating that they are all packed up and ready to begin loading.`
	"CN-16781" `	You find Dusk in the main hall that opens directly off of the bay where the <ship> is docked. Remnant scurry around stacking equipment in preparation for loading, and a team appears to be setting up a number of instruments around the periphery of the room. Dusk spots you, and waves you over to where he appears to be checking the readings on a console.`
	"CN-16782" `	"What are you doing now?"`
	"CN-16783" `	"Ready to load up?"`
	"CN-16784" `	Dusk smiles at you and gestures at the others setting up instruments around the edge of the room. "We are leaving these instruments here running automated data collection routines. We cannot run the main instruments without access to larger power sources such as your ship, but these smaller instruments will be able to record baseline data for us as well as documenting any sudden changes in some of the spectral emanations. They will provide useful data for us in the future." He smiles, then continues. "As the saying goes, the best time to start collecting data is a hundred years ago. The second best time to start collecting data is now."`
	"CN-16785" `	He gestures to the rest of the team, who immediately start loading the <ship>. "Well, it is time to head back." Dusk heads over to the equipment pile, and starts carrying equipment onboard.`
	"CN-16786" `The trip back to <destination> goes quickly but quietly, as all the Remnant seem to be focused on writing reports of their observations. From what you can tell, each member of the team writes up their own observations and experiences, and then Dusk assembles all the reports into an expedition report that includes each researcher's verbatim report as well as his own.`
	"CN-16787" `	The <ship> settles into the current landing pattern for the main spaceport on <destination> as you flip through the exterior camera feeds. In the distance, you notice that one of the research hangars has some activity going on around it, but otherwise, the spaceport seems to be humming along as usual. Dusk stops by the cockpit as you settle the <ship> into its berth. "Thank you for helping us, <first>. It will take us some time to analyze this data, but we will likely be mounting another expedition to Ssil Vida in the near future." He pauses, then adds, "I do not think we ever mentioned it, but, as is appropriate for your assistance, a logistics adjustment of <payment> has been applied to your account to cover your costs and provide resources to prepare for future endeavors." Dusk gives you a polite nod before heading off to help the other researchers unload the equipment.`
	"CN-16788" `You step out of the <ship> into the fresh air of <origin>. You recall seeing some unusual activity over at one of the research hangars. There must be something interesting going on to generate that much activity.`
	"CN-16789" `	(Not today.)`
	"CN-16790" `	(Go check out the activity.)`
	"CN-16791" `	You follow the stream of engineers and technicians to find Taely wedged into a cavity on what must be a ship. You cannot quite tell what it looks like, however, because it is still surrounded by scaffolding, tubes, and other systems. Whatever it is, it is quite small: without all the construction rigging, you suspect that it would probably be only slightly larger than a Puffin.`
	"CN-16792" `	As you peer around the supports a Remnant scurries up with a slimy cable in a bag and hands it to you. "Here, Taely will need this in a few seconds, could you hand it to her when she asks for it? I need to go find the next part. Thanks!" The Remnant vanishes into an adjacent storage room before you even have the chance to respond. Almost immediately, however, Taely twists around to look back at you. "Oh, <first>! I was expecting Cora to be there with the... Ah, they gave it to you. Excellent. If you could just hand it up to me, it would be much appreciated." You reach up to hand her the bag, and Taely inches farther into the craft until only her feet are visible. A few liquid sounds later, and Taely slides back out and drops to the ground.`
	"CN-16793" `	"So, you came to see what the excitement was about?"`
	"CN-16794" `	"I spotted it on final for landing and I was curious."`
	"CN-16795" `	"I saw it while inbound for landing and was worried."`
	"CN-16796" `	"Thanks for checking up on us then," she signs with a smile. "People being concerned for the welfare of those around them is the adhesive that makes society strong."`
	"CN-16797" `	She gestures to the ship next to her. "You have arrived in our space at an opportune time, <first>. While most of our developments over the years have been tweaking existing ships, tweaks can only go so far. Starting long before we established our first shipyard, we have been constantly innovating and trying out new ship designs. Every new development is put on the conceptual model to see if it can help us build a better ship." She grimaces slightly. "Well, that is a bit hyperbolic. Not every development applies to spacecraft, just the ones of most interest to me." She grins at that. "In any case, several of our development projects are nearing the point of production, and this prototype should be operational within a few days."`
	"CN-16798" `	She pats a piece of exposed hull, and you think you can almost feel some kind of vibration or hum in response. Taely takes on a distant expression, as if lost in thought. After a long enough pause to feel awkward, she blinks a few times and focuses on you again. "Sorry about that. A new ship waking up and all that." She smiles, thoughtfully. "Before I get absorbed in my work again, would you be able to make a delivery for me? It is a simple one, but important. I need someone to deliver a set of data files to <stopovers>. As my development project has reached its end, it is time to send a hard copy of the data to one of our archives for safe keeping. Could you deliver it for me?"`
	"CN-16799" `	"I am too busy for that."`
	"CN-16800" `	Taely looks disappointed, but shrugs. "No problem, I will get someone else to deliver it."`
	"CN-16801" `	Taely looks pleased. "Excellent. Just deliver this to the archive on <stopovers>." She hands you a very robust looking data crystal. "Looks a bit different from other data crystals, I am sure." She pauses. "These are archival crystals, and as such they have more robust data structures with many more layers of redundancy and error correction. Likewise, they have many additional layers of encryption and security to ensure that it does not fall into enemy hands. In other words, perfect for long-term storage." She smiles. "Once you have delivered this, please come back shortly to help with the initial launch of the new prototype."`
	"CN-16802" `Glancing around the spaceport, you quickly spot an information desk with several busy looking Remnant. As you approach, one of them signs a greetings to you and asks how they can be of service today. A few gestures later, and they pull out a device that they wave over the data crystal. The device makes a number of chirps before falling silent, at which the Remnant looks satisfied. "Everything looks in order, Captain <last>. Please come this way." He gestures towards an inconspicuous hallway tucked behind the information desk.`
	"CN-16803" `	The Remnant leads you through several sets of increasingly impressive doors before arriving at a room filled with tiny doors. He picks one, uses a key to open it, and pull out a small metal box that they unlock with a second key. "If you would place the data crystal here, we will record the surface metadata, and those who need it will be able to retrieve it when necessary." He waits until you have placed it in the box, then reverses the process to secure it in the vault wall again.`
	"CN-16804" `	The Remnant gestures, "If you are in a rush, you can drop it off in the surface vault for now, and I will move it to its proper storage location myself later. Or you can deliver it to the deep vault yourself."`
	"CN-16805" `	"The surface vault."`
	"CN-16806" `	"The deep vault."`
	"CN-16807" `	The Remnant leads you through several sets of increasingly impressive doors before finally taking you through an almost invisible door tucked in the back corner of a storage room. Inside, he pauses and gestures, "I would recommend you hold onto the rails, and either hook your feet onto the toeholds or activate the magnets in your boots, if you have them. The drop is quite sudden." Looking around, you note that there are what look like toeholds bolted to the floor around the edge of the room, and your guide has inserted his feet into one pair.`
	"CN-16808" `	As soon as you gesture that you are ready, the floor seems to drop out from below you. It seems as though you are in an elevator dropping down so fast that you are experiencing negative g-forces. After several minutes it begins to slow down, and instead of feeling lighter than usual, you feel heavier than usual as gravity catches up. Eventually, however, it eases off and the door opens once again.`
	"CN-16809" `	"Well, onwards we go."`
	"CN-16810" `	"How far down are we?"`
	"CN-16811" `	The Remnant smiles, and gestures, "I do not know the exact distance, but suffice to say that it is far enough that multiple direct strikes to the spaceport with nuclear ordnance would be insufficient to penetrate to this depth."`
	"CN-16812" `	Outside the elevator, the Remnant leads you down a short hallway with many doors, and eventually it opens onto a larger hall. At the opposite end of the hall is a massive door flanked with several large devices that look remarkably similar to Point Defense Turrets, but subtly different. Your guide takes a few steps into the room, and a short pedestal pops out of the floor near him. He pulls a license out of his pocket, places it in the slot, and presses firmly on it for a second, before removing it once again.`
	"CN-16813" `	He then walks briskly across the hall, gesturing for you to follow. Shields flare in and out of existence around the two of you, forming a series of openings that allow you to approach the vault door, which opens when you reach it. Inside is a disappointingly small room with a small tray on a pedestal.`
	"CN-16814" `	"If you would place the data crystal here, we will record the surface metadata, and those who need it will be able to retrieve it when necessary." He gestures to the tray, and once you place the data crystal on it, a shield springs into existence surrounding the tray, and the whole assembly sinks into the floor.`
	"CN-16815" `	"Well, that is done. Taely is waiting for me."`
	"CN-16816" `	"Those turrets looked different."`
	"CN-16817" `	The Remnant nods. "You are observant. Most of those turrets are, in fact, the originals that we discovered here. Each one is a veritable fortress in and of itself, which is why we built similar ones to use as point defense systems for our ships."`
	"CN-16818" `	"Originals?"`
	"CN-16819" `	"You did not build the vault?"`
	"CN-16820" `	"What do you mean by fortress?"`
	"CN-16821" `	"Yes, originals. As in, they were built by those who lived here before us, and survived countless eons protecting these hidden vaults. Even after so much time, they were still sufficiently functional to be formidable obstacles. We have since repaired them and learned much, including a lot that we have yet to be able to put into practice." He sighs, but makes a gesture of anticipation. "If we can master even half the science that made these, we will be able to achieve things that would seem like magic to those still on the ancestral worlds."`
	"CN-16822" `	"But you produce these turrets for use on ships..."`
	"CN-16823" `	"What about the Point Defense Turrets on your ships?"`
	"CN-16824" `	"There is a big difference between being able to make something that looks similar, and being able to recreate something perfectly. The elements that we have formed into the defense turrets are actually the simplest and least advanced pieces of these ancient protectors." He shakes his head. "Someday, though. We are making new breakthroughs all the time."`
	"CN-16825" `	The Remnant's gestures take on a tone of curiosity. "We are not sure what they are intended to hold, but their design includes a lot of passageways and chambers that resemble a hive or a miniature city. Some have speculated that the vault builders might have been minuscule beings, which would mean that these protective devices might well have housed thousands of individuals." He shakes his head. "It must have been quite the feat to survive and prosper in a world where wildlife could annihilate a village in a single footstep." After allowing you a moment to absorb the implications, he turns back to the door. "Time to go, Captain. The sentries grow twitchy when people dawdle here."`
	"CN-16826" `	"No, we did not build the vaults. They were built by ancient inhabitants of these worlds. We were lucky to find them, hidden away as they were. We have studied them, repaired them, and added additional layers of our own; but fundamentally these are still the structures left behind by those who came before." He nods appreciatively at the surrounding room. Taking a moment to look around, you note that the walls and floor join seamlessly, and are made of a dark metallic substance that seems to shimmer. After allowing you a moment to admire the design, he turns back to the door. "Time to go, Captain. We would not want the sentries to think you were dawdling here."`
	"CN-16827" `	The Remnant leads you back out of the vault the same way you entered, and back to the information desk. He thanks you for your assistance and waves farewell before being drawn into a conversation with another ship captain. You gesture a polite farewell and head back to the spaceport. Taely mentioned something about launching a new prototype, and that is likely to be interesting.`
	"CN-16828" `You have barely cleared the security perimeter when your commlink chimes twice with a notification of a logistics credit of <payment> being deposited to your account, closely following a message to land on pad 3E5 near the research hangar Taely has been working in.`
	"CN-16829" `You disembark from the <ship> just in time to watch a trio of small ships taxi out of the hangar where Taely has been working. They are strange little ships, only somewhat larger than the Terns and Petrels. What stands out the most, however, is the fact that the three ships seem to be walking of their own accord, moving forward on flexible landing legs.`
	"CN-16830" `	Taely follows them out, and when they reach the landing pad she whistles, causing the three ships to turn and cluster around her. You can see her smile even from where you're standing, and as you watch she reaches up to pat each of them on the nose. The trio sparkle with iridescent ripples as they move around, the skin flexing and twisting like some sort of organic creature.`
	"CN-16831" `	(Walk over to where she is standing.)`
	"CN-16832" `	(Wait until she notices me.)`
	"CN-16833" `	After several minutes of watching Taely commune with the trio of ships, she turns toward you and waves you over. "Enjoying the view?" she signs as you approach, but she continues without waiting for a response. "They are nice ships, and a major step forward in our ship development. Well worth watching." She nods to herself as she runs a hand along a fin, as if checking something.`
	"CN-16834" `	Taely waves to you as you approach. "Eager to meet the latest additions to our fleet?" She pats the nose of the nearest ship again. "They definitely are a beautiful addition to the Remnant patrols." She smiles to herself and runs a hand along one of the fins as if checking for something.`
	"CN-16835" `	"Captain <first>," she signs, "Please meet our first three Mergansers. I have been working on them for years now, and recent breakthroughs in our materials science have enabled significant progress in our ship designs." She pauses and gestures to one. "Would you like to touch them?"`
	"CN-16836" `	"Captain <first>," she signs, "Please meet our first three Mergansers. I have been working on them for years now. In fact, the Penguin that you helped me complete was an early prototype that was testing some of the techniques for these. With that and other recent breakthroughs in our materials science, significant progress in our ship designs has been made possible." She pauses and gestures to one. "Would you like to touch them?"`
	"CN-16837" `	Taely smiles. "Just hold out your hand, and let it sense you first. Once it bumps your hand, you can touch it safely." You follow her example, and a few moments later the nearest Merganser nudges your hand. You follow Taely's lead in running your hand along it, and you discover that - despite the slimy appearance - the ship's skin is dry and smooth. The surface is clearly metallic, but you can feel it stretch and twist under your hand as the ship shifts and moves. You can feel pulsing vibrations not entirely unlike the ones you are used to on the <ship>, but with subtle fluctuations.`
	"CN-16838" `	"So what do these ships do?"`
	"CN-16839" `	"Amazing what science can do these days."`
	"CN-16840" `	"They are beautiful."`
	"CN-16841" `	Taely nods in agreement. "I am glad you can appreciate some of the things we have achieved here. It makes me think that you will appreciate some of my other projects too.`
	"CN-16842" `	"Historically, we have relied on Starlings to fill multiple light combat roles here in the Ember Waste. Reconnaissance, sentry duty, escort, picket, patrol... they have filled so many roles." She pauses, glancing at a departing Starling. "Of course, we could just make more Starlings, but our pool of specialized crew is not infinite either. The solution I have is these Mergansers. They are sufficiently advanced that they only require a single person to operate and have significant range, enough to patrol large portions of the Ember Waste. This makes them ideal for escorting Gulls on resource gathering expeditions, patrolling for incursions, and other uses. Perhaps most importantly, though, is that they are fast enough to chase down anything we have encountered out here so far."`
	"CN-16843" `	She frowns a bit at that. "Unfortunately, the weapons program is not moving as quickly as I would like, so the Merganser does not have the tackling ability that I was originally envisioning for it. But at least it is an adept hunter we can use to pursue our enemies."`
	"CN-16844" `	"What 'tackling ability?'"`
	"CN-16845" `	"In space combat, 'tackling' refers to the tactic of pinning down an enemy to make them vulnerable to the rest of the fleet. It can also refer to hindering a target's ability to move, run, or escape. You are probably familiar with the idea of using missiles or weapons with an impact force to disrupt an opponent's hyperjump. This is a prime example of tackling." She pauses, thoughtfully. "Our inhibitors are tackling weapons, but they are not sufficiently effective as far as I am concerned."`
	"CN-16846" `	"What is the problem with them?"`
	"CN-16847" `	"Decisive strike capability, mostly." Her gestures take on a conciliatory tone. "They are excellent weapons for swarms of ships, or when mounted on a ship that can carry many of them. But when one only has the opportunity to land a few hits, they are insufficient to pin down their target. But that is an aside. For now, we should celebrate our new ships, and see what they can do." She pets the nearest Merganser lovingly.`
	"CN-16848" `	"But enough of that." She shakes her head and assumes a business-like expression. "We would like you to lead a pair of shakedown runs. The first is a hunt for a crippled Korath ship that got stuck in <waypoints>. We will provide you with this Merganser to fly." She pats its nose fondly. "Along with a flight of four to accompany you. Of course you are free to fly your own ship if you prefer; the important part is that you all make it back intact. So, are you up for a test flight?"`
	"CN-16849" `You disembark to the sight of Taely striding across the tarmac, but she veers away from you at the last minute to pat the nose of one of the Mergansers. She runs a finger gently along a weapon score for a moment, then turns to face you. "So, the Korath are still capable fighters, I see." She pauses, her eyes take on a distant look for a second before she continues. "But you have returned with the flock intact. Come, join us for a meal and tell me how they fared." She leads you into the hangar where a bunch of engineers and technicians are gathered in one corner with a rack full of food trays. They enthusiastically greet you and the Merganser pilots, and quickly pull you into discussions of how the Mergansers handled their first patrol.`
	"CN-16850" `	Before long the technicians and pilots are trading stories while the Mergansers overshadow the group. Sometimes they poke various engineers or technicians, and the technicians frequently share messages from their commlinks. Apparently they have them hooked up to the Mergansers, so the ships are sharing their own accounts of the patrol. After several hours of the festivities, Taely announces that everyone needs to get to sleep because tomorrow is a new day. As everyone bids their farewells, you note that they include the ships, with most people patting or stroking one or more of the ships on their way out.`
	"CN-16851" `	"Stop by the cafeteria tomorrow morning, <first>. Dusk and I will have more you can help with, if you are interested." With that, she gestures farewell and heads off at a brisk pace.`
	"CN-16852" `	"Stop by the cafeteria once your current work with Dusk is concluded; we will have more you can help with, if you are interested." With that, she gestures farewell and heads off at a brisk pace.`
	"CN-16853" `When you enter the cafeteria you are greeted by Dusk and Taely signing at you from across the room to join them. Collecting a tray from the dispenser, you slide into an empty seat at their table, watching as Taely signs: "We were just exchanging news and discovered we can combine our next assignment."`
	"CN-16854" `	Dusk continues. "Based on the initial data we collected while we were at Ssil Vida, there is sufficient novel data to deserve a permanent research team there. Conveniently, the station is already habitable, but we will need several shipments of equipment to set up a self-contained section."`
	"CN-16855" `	"Okay, clear enough."`
	"CN-16856" `	"Why do you need to do that?"`
	"CN-16857" `	"For safety. The station might appear to be enduring and constant, but if we lacked independent facilities, the slightest failure could kill everyone. Given that we do not even understand how the station is running, depending on it moving forward would be foolish." Taely nods in agreement with Dusk, and adds, "We will, of course, be looking to do a full evaluation of the station eventually, but it is rather massive. It will be quite some time before we can finish that."`
	"CN-16858" `	Dusk gestures and their commlink sprays a holographic list into the air between you. "Basically, we would like you to load this set of equipment, then stop by Esquiline to pick up a technician by the name of Gavriil, who will be leading the establishment of the life support systems on Ssil Vida."`
	"CN-16859" `	"I know Gavriil."`
	"CN-16860" `	"Who is that?"`
	"CN-16861" `	"Gavriil is a technician with a knack for balancing life support systems, especially in situations with multiple environments that need to be kept in harmony. As I recall, you worked with them to set up Esquiline station."`
	"CN-16862" `	"Excellent. They are looking forward to working with you again. Now that the multi-environment facet of Esquiline is on track, they are ready to move on to a new challenge."`
	"CN-16863" `	Dusk scans down the list of equipment. "This will be enough to get things started. We will have regular supply runs start after you deliver these, so there should be just the initial load that we would like you to take. Can you do it?"`
	"CN-16864" `As you slip into the dock on Esquiline it quickly becomes apparent that the station is rapidly returning to full functionality, or perhaps even expanding beyond its original design: people are everywhere, and most of them are moving with purpose or diligently working on something. Several technicians cling to the ceiling overhead as they install a new conduit. Despite the busy atmosphere, people frequently stop to glance out the windows, and a flutter of gestures break out whenever someone spots a void sprite. Seeing how busy it is, you understand the traffic controller's request that you refrain from taking up a berth for longer than necessary.`
	"CN-16865" `	You find Gavriil nearby, where they are going over a freshly installed hydroponics array with a pair of Remnant in tow. They quickly finish and gesture farewell to the other two before walking over to you. "Greetings, Captain <first>! Welcome back to Esquiline. It has changed a bit since you were here last." Their gestures have an overtone of pride. "Dusk told me that we have a new station to bring online again, so we should probably get moving."`
	"CN-16866" `The equipment is promptly unloaded as Gavriil scouts some of the nearby rooms. "I have picked a suitable area to start in. If you could help move these over to that room there" - they gesture toward one of the large rooms with the platforms in it - "it would be much appreciated."`
	"CN-16867" `	"Why the rush?"`
	"CN-16868" `	"Suit yourself, I have work to do." They quickly set to moving the equipment to the desired room.`
	"CN-16869" `	"Thanks, many hands make light work." You quickly have all the equipment moved into the desired room.`
	"CN-16870" `	"Here, help me carry this and we can talk while we shift this." They hand you a lift and the two of you start moving the equipment. "Basically, we had a visitor out here. Not sure who they were, but they flew a Palavret with a wide mix of alien technology. Our scans said there was one Korath in charge, with a crew composed of both aliens and humans. And they came with enough firepower to make life miserable for everyone. We only had a few scouts in the area, so we stayed hidden and bargained. In the end, they gave us some 'inconsequential' data, and they got an hour to explore the station and take a few loose items. Our scans indicated that they took some stuff without much obvious value from these big halls." They gesture to the room around you with all the platforms.`
	"CN-16871" `	"That is odd."`
	"CN-16872" `	"What did the Remnant get?"`
	"CN-16873" `	"What leverage did the Remnant use to bargain?"`
	"CN-16874" `	Gavriil smiles. "Well, it seems that the captain of that ship found it distressing that we could pinpoint and detail them and their crew with sufficient data that we could use their own appearance as fake video in our transmissions, not to mention that we successfully identified them among the rest of the crew on board the ship. And it was doubly distressing for them that, despite their impressive scanner arrays, they were not able to even catch the slightest emission that might hint at where or who we were." Gavriil pauses as they palm open a door to pull the loaded lift through, then continues. "They blustered initially, but when we started listing off precise defects and wear present on their various computer systems they decided it was better to make a deal."`
	"CN-16875" `	"Clever!"`
	"CN-16876" `	"What did you get from them?"`
	"CN-16877" `	You finish unloading the equipment into the room before Gavriil continues. "Well, the Korath have been around for a comparatively long time. So we asked for their astronomical dataset. The data we received was raw, uncorrected, and continuous data covering multiple tens of thousands of years of stellar observations. The set even includes data that likely corresponds to the destruction of some of their worlds during their civil war." They pause, then continue. "Of course, we need to verify the data first. So far, though, it is checking out successfully against already trusted records. If it can be validated, the set will massively expand the data our researchers can use to model and study the universe."`
	"CN-16878" `	Gavriil tucks the lifter away into a storage alcove. "Well, thank you for your help, <first>. That definitely sped up the process."`
	"CN-16879" `	They look around at the stacks of equipment, and turn to you. "This will keep me busy for a few days, but if you would be willing to do some patrols, it would be much appreciated. I will have details for you once I have a few things unpacked."`
	"CN-16880" `You have barely had a chance to finish your pre-flight checks on <ship> before Gavriil is tapping on your airlock. "Setting up a new environment is always an interesting challenge," Gavriil gestures. "But to the task at hand: Could you do a quick patrol through this collection of newly accessible systems? We have scouts en route with surveillance satellites to place in each of them, but I picked up the signature of a Palavret that was here recently, and I want to be sure that it left no surprises." They pause, then make a gesture you have come to recognize as meaning the accompanying message is intended as a summary. "So, visit each of the systems in this sector, and make sure that the Palavret did not leave anything behind." Their gestures switch to a tone of finality. "Can you help with this?"`
	"CN-16881" `Back on Ssil Vida, you check in with Gavriil and report the destruction of three 'olofezes that you located. "Three?" They sign quizzically. "That is an odd number. Palavrets only carry two at most. I will report this right away. But in the meantime, come take a look at what I have set up." They lead you off toward the spaceport.`
	"CN-16882" `Gavriil strides into the room with confidence. "Look at this!" they gesture at the smooth sheeting covering the walls while the new equipment quietly hums away off to the side. A large panel with a diagram of the station stands out in the middle of it.`
	"CN-16883" `	"Setting up the life support systems as a self-contained environment within the station was simple enough that I did some preliminary power tracing on the station itself. It seems that the station is currently being powered by an immense fusion reactor that is clearly reaching its end of life." They pause, then continue. "Not to mention it is basically running on the dregs of the dregs of the remains of its spent fuel. I do not know how much longer it will last, but likely no more than a few weeks. As best I can tell, it is still trying to power everything, but the main load" - they point to the glowing red sphere on the hologram - "seems to have simply shutdown once the power levels dropped below a certain threshold." They frown at the display.`
	"CN-16884" `	"I do not know what will happen to the station when the main reactor fails completely, and we are not interested in letting this station collapse before we have had the chance to thoroughly investigate it. As such, we need to take action now to give ourselves room to work." They turn toward you. "I have contacted Viminal, and they have an Aeon Cell ready for transport. Please go pick it up and transport it back here." They smile faintly. "Oh, and it does not matter whether you transport it installed on your ship or in your cargo, but make sure it is not your primary power source: I have the tools to uninstall it from your ship and set it up to connect to the station, but I do not have the equipment to install it back into your ship." They pause to check a readout on the display. "Remember: it is vital that I have the Aeon Cell by <date>."`
	"CN-16885" `Gavriil has you unload the Aeon Cell into a corner of a nearby bay. "Thank you, <first>! The station is running critically low on power, and this should help stabilize it. We will eventually need a full team out here as well as some fuel to get the main reactor running properly, but first we need to figure out exactly what it uses."`
	"CN-16886" `	They pull out their commlink and check a few things. "Go to Caelian and check in with Torza. He should have finished putting the team through their paces by the time you get there. See you soon, Captain!"`
	"CN-16887" `Your commlink springs to life as you enter final approach to Caelian, revealing Torza in a flurry of motion. He focuses momentarily on the camera. "Captain <first>, and flying a ship with a substantial lifting capacity, excellent! The Korath have discovered one of our forward operating bases, and we need help evacuating it now. It is located on Baianus in the Parca system. There are 20 people and 280 cubic meters of equipment to retrieve. The Korath have set up a blockade, so you will need something reasonably fast to get through it. You can fight them or not, as you wish, but the primary task is evacuating the outpost. Embers speed your flight, Captain."`
	"CN-16888" `Punching through the Korath blockade finds you racing across the aurora-filled skies of Baianus. You quickly slide into the designated approach track and start to enter your IFF code as a barrage of anti-air fire erupts from the ground to lance over your shoulder. As you drop into evasive maneuvers you spot the wreckage of an 'olofez tumbling to the ice behind you, and a firelance beam sears the air where the <ship> had just been. Moments later you get the confirmation signal that they have accepted your ID and are tracking your position.`
	"CN-16889" `Destroying the Korath ships blockading this system purchases some respite. However, it does not last long as some Korath ships were in the aurora-filled atmosphere and, having evaded your assault in space, now move to pursue you, intent on stopping you from reaching the Remnant base. As you transmit your IFF code, you are aided by an eruption of anti-air fire from below, which sends an 'olofez tumbling to the icy surface as its last breath of fire misses the <ship>. Along with confirmation of recognizing you, the Remnant at the base ahead inform you that their timetable has not changed despite the currently lessened Korath presence in the system; more ships are already on the way.`
	"CN-16890" `	As you approach the entrance to the hidden starport, directions appear on your comm panel guiding you to a spot where a large stack of equipment surrounds the landing pad. You ease inside and have barely touched down when a technician is dropping from the ceiling onto your hull with a refueling hose and repair equipment. Meanwhile, a swarm of Remnant are prepping and moving various equipment, many with lifts and loaders. You quickly open the cargo hold doors, and the Remnant rush to load and board the <ship>.`
	"CN-16891" `	The Remnant move fast, but you can hear the battle approaching. Even through the <ship>'s dampeners you can feel the heavy thud of anti-air artillery. The whine of generators being pushed to the limit fills the air as the shields crackle with incoming fire. Through the cacophony the Remnant move with purpose, gesturing instructions silently through the din. Finally the last load is packed onboard, and one of them comes up to the cockpit. "Thank you for your assistance, Captain <last>. As the explosive charges have been set, I recommend we leave promptly." They nod respectfully, then strap themselves into the nearest harness.`
	"CN-16892" `	The shield opens one final time to allow you to leave, and you practically leap into the teeth of a Korath attack. The anti-air artillery continues its rhythmic barrage against the incoming ships, but it is evident that both it and the shields around the base are failing under the assault. As you head for orbit, the last image you see is the artillery pieces sag and collapse as they melt into the ground. Your sensors record a sudden explosion from the cavern, to which the Remnant give a sad but satisfied nod. "Take us back to Caelian please, Captain."`
	"CN-16893" `The brutal sun of Caelian hits you like a hammer as you open the hatch to let the evacuees out. A few of the Remnant step into the sun as if relishing the heat, while others move quickly to the shade of a nearby structure to confer. Several, however, need to be carried out to waiting vehicles: it seems that they were hurt in one of the initial raids, and while adrenaline kept them going during the evacuation, their condition deteriorated during the flight back. The Remnant carry them with reverent haste, and then the vehicles they are loaded into vanish quickly into nearby structures.`
	"CN-16894" `	"The Embers saw you safely through," gestures Torza with a note of appreciation, appearing from a nearby hatch. "The loss of that outpost is unfortunate, but at least most of the Remnant there survived. Thank you for your assistance." He glances at his commlink. "Your logistics adjustment has been added to your account, of course, but I suspect that you are interested in pushing forward the progress in studying Ssil Vida. Meet me in the spaceport when you are ready."`
	"CN-16895" `You walk into the cafeteria to find a group of Remnant looking tired but pleased with themselves. Torza is striding among them with a tray filled with bottles, handing them out. "Good work, everyone. Excellent pacing on that run." He turns towards you. "And right on schedule, the captain who will be transporting you over to Ssil Vida." He gestures for you to take a seat and offers you a bottle as well.`
	"CN-16896" `	(Gesture that I am not thirsty.)`
	"CN-16897" `	(Take a bottle and gesture appreciation.)`
	"CN-16898" `	You sip from the bottle, and discover that it tastes like some kind of restorative sports drink. You can pick out hints of salt and a few other flavors, but most of it is an indeterminate taste you cannot quite identify. Torza nods in approval as you drink. "Especially in heat like this, hydration is important." He continues weaving around the group handing out the remaining bottles.`
	"CN-16899" `	(Drink in silence.)`
	"CN-16900" `	(Ask the Remnant next to me what just happened.)`
	"CN-16901" `	The Remnant smiles tiredly. "We did a ten kilometer run in just under thirty seven minutes, wearing our emergency environmental suits and carrying basic survival and maintenance gear. Torza set a hard pace, but we kept up." She takes a sip from her drink. "It is hard work, but endurance is rather important for survival, especially in an unknown environment like <planet>." She takes another sip. "It was an interesting change of pace. Normally I carry full engineering kit, so this was a 'fast scramble' in comparison. He" - she gestures at Torza - "likes to change things up. No two runs are the same when he sets the pace."`
	"CN-16902" `	Torza quickly continues his rounds, and soon everyone is sipping on a drink. Several have pulled up displays of Ssil Vida, while others are chatting as they go over inventory lists. Most of the conversation that you catch sounds like a group of technicians prepping for a mission.`
	"CN-16903" `	After a few minutes Torza gestures for everyone to pay attention. "Now, to review the parameters: <planet> appears to be a giant mechanism for doing something we do not yet know. The core systems have exhausted the capacity of the large fusion reactor to supply them. The installation of the Aeon Cell has reduced the strain on the system, but it cannot fully power the station. You need to focus on the power systems, and figure out how to fully stabilize the distribution. While you are doing that, <first> will be returning to Viminal for the next step in this operation. You will all be staying on <planet> for at least a few months, maybe longer, as the situation warrants. Agreed?" Around the room there are a variety of nods and gestures of affirmation.`
	"CN-16904" `	Torza makes a gesture of respect. "Embers sharpen your sight, friends."`
	"CN-16905" `Gavriil is waiting at the dock when the <ship>'s hatches finish cycling. "Welcome," they gesture. "It is good to have fresh minds to share <planet> with." The Remnant onboard stream out of the ship in a rush, each carrying a heavy pack of equipment. They gesture respect, and head off in different directions. Evidently they have studied the maps prior to arrival, as they all seem to know where they are going. Several stay behind with Gavriil and help unload the rest of the equipment, some of which appears to include the core equipment of an outfitters.`
	"CN-16906" `	"We have made good progress since you were here last. We have managed to take over control of life support systems in several wings of rooms, and now those are run entirely from our own systems. Aside from relieving a tiny amount of load from the station's power core, it also means that the station could fail completely and we would still have safe living quarters to serve as our base of operations."`
	"CN-16907" `	They pause, and their gestures take on a tone of disgust. "Of course, we are working to avoid such a failure. But having multiple backup systems is the key to survival in hostile conditions."`
	"CN-16908" `	They look around at the few Remnant who have yet to vanish into the rest of the station. "Thank you for bringing more explorers." They hand you a data crystal. "I have already transmitted this data to Viminal, but I would appreciate it if you could take this to them to ensure there are no errors or data corruption in the transmission."`
	"CN-16909" `Not knowing who to deliver the data crystal to, you take it to the information desk. The Remnant currently working there gestures that they have been expecting it and thanks you for delivering it. As you leave the information desk, your commlink chimes with a message from Prefect Chilia: he would like to speak with you, and is currently in the spaceport cafeteria.`
	"CN-16910" `Chilia and Taely look excited about something when you find them in the cafeteria, but they indicate that your other work with Dusk will need to be completed before you can continue your work here.`
	"CN-16911" `Chilia is just collecting his tray from the counter when you step into the cafeteria. Seeing you enter, he picks up a second and nods toward a pair of open seats at a table with Taely and Dusk. "We are glad you could make it, <first>." Taely looks happy, brimming with contained energy. "It is an exciting day, Captain, but Dusk should lead." She nods to Dusk, who sets down his fork to gesture.`
	"CN-16912" `	"While Gavriil has been making excellent progress setting up facilities on Ssil Vida, I have been working with a team of xenolinguists on deciphering the data we have collected so far. Based on Gavriil's recommendations, we have been focusing on the power distribution system."`
	"CN-16913" `	A hologram of Ssil Vida appears in the air over the table, then fades away to leave a large highlighted object with a network of lines reaching around the station. "As Gavriil has told you, the station's primary power source appears to be a massive fusion reactor. As best we can tell, it is quite a simple design, albeit one built for totally automated functioning and bigger than the largest reactors ever built by humanity. Unfortunately, it has consumed its entire fuel supply and is currently using up the last of the fuel it is capable of extracting by refining spent fuel. Our current estimates is that it is producing less than ten percent of its nominal power. This is sufficiently low that it has already ceased powering the majority of the station's systems." He gestures to Chilia.`
	"CN-16914" `	"Based on our analysis, the reactor appears to use a very specific isotope. Whether it is truly needed or others would suffice is unknown, but for now we are inclined to provide it with an exact match. While we will be able to produce it eventually, it will take time that we do not have." The diagram of Ssil Vida vanishes and is replaced by a map of the galaxy, which focuses in on <system>, near the juncture of the Rim and the South. "Our records indicate that the most easily accessible deposits are on <planet>." Chilia turns to you. "As you are from ancestral space and are most familiar with the people there, we would like you to travel there and bring back 58 cubic meters of processed fuel for the reactor. Can you do this?"`
	"CN-16915" `	A hologram of Ssil Vida appears in the air over the table, then fades away to leave a large highlighted object with a network of lines reaching around the station. "As Gavriil has told you, the station's primary power source appears to be a massive fusion reactor. Based on our initial scans, it appears to be a match to the Sheragi reactor you recently discovered, albeit on a vastly larger scale. Unfortunately, it has consumed its entire fuel supply and is currently using up the last of the fuel it is capable of extracting by refining spent fuel. Our current estimates is that it is producing less than ten percent of its nominal power. This is sufficiently low that it has already ceased powering the majority of the station's systems." He gestures to Chilia.`
	"CN-16916" `	"Based on our analysis, the reactor appears to use a very specific isotope, which appears to be one favored by the Sheragi. Whether it is truly needed or others would suffice is unknown, but for now we are inclined to provide it with an exact match. While we will be able to produce it eventually, it will take time that we do not have." The diagram of Ssil Vida vanishes and is replaced by a map of the galaxy, which focuses in on <system>, in the heart of the ancient Sheragi territory. "Our records indicate that the most easily accessible deposits are on <planet>." Chilia turns to you. "As you have worked extensively around that area, and are thus familiar with the people there, we would like you to travel there and bring back 58 cubic meters of processed fuel for the reactor. Can you do this?"`
	"CN-16917" `	All four of them look pleased, and exchange looks that seem to indicate they expected that response. Taely gestures with a thankful tone. "We appreciate your willingness to help us explore this mystery, <first>. Given that time is of the essence here, this seems like an opportune time to reveal a new ship that has just reached production." She stands up, and gestures for you to accompany her to the shipyard.`
	"CN-16918" `	There, crouched next to <ship>, is what you can only describe as a predator: it has long sleek lines with flared wings that resemble feathers, and a massive engine array that suggest incomparable mobility in a ship of its size. As you approach you can see several Remnant working around it. One gestures, and, as the ship extends a wing, the Remnant reaches out to make some minor adjustment then steps back. The ship then runs through a range of twisting motions, strongly resembling a raptor preening its feathers.`
	"CN-16919" `	Taely walks right up to its nose, and the ship crouches down so she can put her hand on it. "Captain <first>, I would like to introduce you to the Peregrine. It is the first new capital warship design we have built in over a century, and is the result of decades of work on my part as well as many others. Hopefully, it is the first of many new ships that are successful." She pauses before continuing. "Initially, they will be assigned directly to specific captains, but they will eventually be available for requisition normally."`
	"CN-16920" `	"Looks great. Let's fly!"`
	"CN-16921" `	"What sort of ship is it?"`
	"CN-16922" `	Taely gestures in reverence. "It is what we term a liveship." She scowls at you. "And before you start thinking about ships made of big piles of flesh and ooze, this is obviously not that." She runs her hand along the ship, obviously quite smooth and solid. "Liveships, as we are calling them, are spaceships that have a sufficient degree of self-awareness and self-control to be deemed alive. They are manufactured and have energy and fuel requirements just like any other ship. Likewise, they are largely made of materials similar to what you are familiar with. But they are conscious. They can move and flex in ways that would be impossible to precisely control with servos and traditional position reporting. They can feel where each tendril is as surely as most people can tell where their hand is, and each ripple of a wormhole vortex is as perceptible to them as the crest of a sand dune would be to you or I."`
	"CN-16923" `	She turns to you and pulls up a display, listing off various statistics. "From a technical standpoint, the Peregrine class starship is classified as a medium warship, built along the lines of the fast-attack cruisers from earlier eras. While it does not have the thickest armor or shields we could have installed, it makes up for it in unrivaled mobility and a neural system that has been hardened against some of the effects that could slow it down. It is also, so far, the largest production ship that has built-in cloaking."`
	"CN-16924" `As if on cue, the ship vanishes from sight. There is a brief rustle and a whoosh of air, and the ship reappears on the other side of you. Several of the Remnant working on it look amused, then relocate to continue their tasks. Taely gestures amusement as well and continues. "Given your recent work with Plume, it may also be relevant to you that the Peregrine is what we term a 'gaslined' starship; meaning it is built to not only fly in atmosphere but also handle both the pressure and conditions found in the depths of gas giants and other high-pressure worlds."`
	"CN-16925" `	Taely smiles, and continues. "You should be able to take off shortly, but Chilia does have some final comments on this mission."`
	"CN-16926" `	She gestures to him, and he steps to the front. "Given recent events in ancestral space, the authorities are understandably suspicious of large volumes of refined nuclear fuel being transported around. Likewise, it would be extremely problematic if someone managed to scan the Peregrine. As such, you will need to avoid being scanned."`
	"CN-16927" `	He taps on his commlink. "We have inserted an order for the material into the hyperspace communication system under the company name 'Solar Winds Logistics Ltd.' The miners on <planet> are to have the shipment ready to load at a mining site just outside of the spaceport, far enough away to avoid the standard arrival and departure scans."`
	"CN-16928" `	"Sounds good. Time to go."`
	"CN-16929" `	"What about people seeing the ship?"`
	"CN-16930" `	Chilia grins. "Fortunately for us, the diversity of human preference lends itself to our cause. While there may be only a handful of ships available for sale, spaceships are a surprisingly diverse and unregulated industry. As such, shipyards have carried on the tradition dating back to the earliest of vehicles: if someone has the wealth to pay for it, there is a shipwright willing to build it.`
	"CN-16931" `	"In our time observing Ancestral space, we have seen replicas in flight of every spaceship that has ever graced popular culture or a media production. While many are barely able to manage interplanetary travel, a surprising number are in use as fully functional starships plying the hyperlanes. Given the similarity between our ships and those of certain productions, we are not concerned with being seen - only with being scanned."`
	"CN-16932" `	A hatch opens on the Peregrine, and all the workers quickly finish their tasks and stow their equipment onboard. "Ready for departure when you are, Captain!" calls one from the hatch.`
	"CN-16933" `You have declined an essential Remnant mission, and this ends the Remnant campaign. If that was not what you intended, you may wish to reload.`
	"CN-16934" `Your reception is as friendly as <origin>'s reputation suggests: no one is there to meet you, and no one arrives to help load the cargo. All that greets you is a forlorn security console near the pile of crates and a posted statement directing ships to depart as soon as they finish loading. You use the code Chilia had sent to unlock the crates, load the <ship>, and get ready to head to <planet>.`
	"CN-16935" `	As you are completing your checks, your sensors alert you to the arrival of a small fleet that seems to be maintaining orbit over this area. It looks like you might have to take steps to avoid observers right away.`
	"CN-16936" `When you contact <planet> to confirm where to unload your cargo you are greeted by Dusk, who directs you to a docking bay closer to the main reactor. As you open the hatch, though, it is Gavriil and a group of Remnant with lifters waiting. They welcome you cheerfully, but they definitely seem in a rush to get the processed fuel unloaded and shuttled into the depths of the station. Once the last unit is off your ship, Gavriil slows down enough to thank you for the prompt delivery, but apologizes as they rush off as there is not much time left. Their parting gesture suggests you talk to Dusk up in the control room.`
	"CN-16937" `Up in the control station Dusk and a small team of Remnant are busily working at a bunch of consoles. Alarms blink and are quickly dealt with, only to have new ones appear elsewhere. There is so much motion that it seems like there are twice as many of them. From a glance at the readings, it appears you brought the shipment of fuel just in time: the Aeon Cell is overloaded trying to take over for the fusion reactor, and most of their efforts have been directed toward carefully orchestrating rolling brown outs across the systems to keep everything minimally functional.`
	"CN-16938" `	Gavriil suddenly appears on a viewscreen, gesturing that the fuel injection process has begun, and Dusk anxiously scans a number of readings. There is a moment of stillness, then readings suddenly start to climb. The Remnant quickly recalibrate their sensors to the larger volumes of power being handled, and the readings continue to push the top of the charts upwards. Section by section, whole banks of indicators flicker and fade out. A minute or two later, and the last display ceases to indicate any problems remaining in the power grid.`
	"CN-16939" `	Dusk turns towards you and the team with a satisfied gesture just beginning when there is a sudden shift as if everything had just went sideways. You almost feel like you can see a brief ripple, but it vanishes before you can focus on it. You are left with a feeling that something has changed. At the same time, the proximity sensors and systems monitoring the surrounding system light up. Someone looks up from a console. "The system is alive, Dusk! All those ghost life signs we were picking up just became much more solid!" Another gestures in clipped, fast tones. "And we have several large masses that have appeared as well. They look to be planetary in scale, but the readings seem to indicate something a bit more nebulous."`
	"CN-16940" `	Dusk looks around, and then gestures. "Captain <first>, please go investigate what is going on out there. Just take a good look around and then report back."`
	"CN-16941" `Just like the Remnant said, the system appears to be full of life. Where once there was just asteroids and a fairly empty system, there is now life signs everywhere. As you dodge among the asteroids, you note that most of them appear to have something growing on them: plants. Moss or fungus might be a better word, although you are fairly certain that nothing in the current classifications of life can adequately categorize what you can see outside. The sudden appearance of all this life is only compounded when your sensors light up to notify you that it is tracking several flocks of void sprites.`
	"CN-16942" `	As you move away from the station you continue to spot signs of life and activity everywhere: flitting among the rocks, soaring along the solar winds, and hunting amongst clouds. What is unclear, however, is where it came from. The only hint might be in the fact that your ship instruments report a sudden spike in the ambient energy in the surrounding area.`
	"CN-16943" `Back on the station Dusk, Gavriil, and many of the Remnant on the station meet you in the docking bay. Dusk and several of the others just came back from walking out on the hull of <origin>, and they report seeing void sprites passing close to the station. They quickly pull the data from your ship sensors and throw it up on a holographic display. Everyone gathers around, intently drinking in the data and footage. They stand, stare, and ponder with intense concentration as the data continues to stream in from the station.`
	"CN-16944" `	Without warning, something clicks in your mind. Suddenly there is a hum of hundreds of conversations crowding your thoughts and a momentary feeling of seeing the system through thousands of eyes. You feel a wave of curiosity, and a glimpse of <origin> as it might have been once - shiny and gleaming. The image ages like a fast-forward video of untold thousands of orbits as the station wears and the sky changes around it. Then the image freezes on what appears to be the present day. A feeling of appreciation replaces the sense of curiosity, followed by a blurry image of the <ship> leaving the station and heading in a dozen different directions simultaneously, as if watching it splinter into ghosts.`
	"CN-16945" `	The final image is of the creature the Remnant termed the "Ember Node," floating in space. The image splinters the same way as the image of your ship, and fragments into multiple ghosts of itself that vanish into a rift of energy. The sense of curiosity returns, and then there is another click, and suddenly your mind is your own once again.`
	"CN-16946" `The Remnant have a shocked expression, and a couple of them are looking dazed. Most, however, seem to be handling the incursion fairly well. Dusk gestures eagerly to you. "Good to see you recovered quickly, <first>. We will take care of everyone here - we need you out there. Go do a sweep through each of the surrounding systems, and see if you can get a signal to any of the Remnant worlds. Our communicators have all lost connection, as have the isolated backups. So we need to re-establish communication promptly." He shakes his head. "I love meeting new beings, but they always manage to surprise."`
	"CN-16947" `You have successfully visited all the nearby systems. Time to report back to <origin>.`
	"CN-16948" `Back in the control room the Remnant appear to have regained their composure. Remnant move quickly from station to station, and every sensor and tool is in use. It is as if the Remnant are afraid everything is going to vanish any moment. Which, you realize, might actually happen. You find Gavriil carefully tending a console, and they look up as you approach. "The Embers guided you back, I see. How does the outside world fare?"`
	"CN-16949" `	They listen intently as you described your flight through the surrounding systems, and nods when you mention that your navigation system is reporting no connections to the rest of the Ember Waste. Even predictions as to jump drive performance indicate no valid jumps.`
	"CN-16950" `	"No connections whatsoever?" Gavriil looks thoughtful. "That actually makes sense." They gesture at a display of the area. "As best our sensors can pick up, the universe beyond this pocket of the Ember Waste just does not exist."`
	"CN-16951" `	They quickly continue. "Of course, we can see it out there. But it is like looking through a very thin film." Gavriil looks thoughtful. "The current leading theory is that we are in some kind of dimensional bubble. A pocket dimension of sorts. But we have not yet reached a consensus."`
	"CN-16952" `	"What happened to us? Did we all see the same thing?"`
	"CN-16953" `	"Where did those feelings and images come from?"`
	"CN-16954" `	Gavriil frowns in thought. "Based on our initial survey, each person had a slightly different experience. We think that everyone had basically the same event, but as it was a series of impressions, images, and feelings, each person picked up on different aspects of it."`
	"CN-16955" `	Their gestures take on a confident tone. "Which makes sense, since our life experiences shape our perceptions. Still, as to what it was..." They pause, gathering their thoughts. "Our best guess is that this was first contact with some sort of entity." They grin at that. "I know, stating the obvious. But anyway, Dusk thinks that it might be some sort of solitary entity, as it did not use words or meanings, despite having access to our minds. As such, it uses internals to convey meaning instead of words." They glance at a map of the system. "There is, however, no indication as to where it came from."`
	"CN-16956" `	"What happened to the long range communication?"`
	"CN-16957" `	"Well, that is a good question. We have, and still are, running diagnostics on them, and so far they are passing all their checks. The system safeties, isolation mechanisms, security monitoring, tamper-proofing, self-destruct systems, backup hardening..." They shake their head, stymied.`
	"CN-16958" `	"Everything looks in perfect working order. The only problem is that the quantum pairs at the heart just do not seem to have a pair anymore. In terms of quantum mechanics, it seems that the rest of the universe quite simply does not exist."`
	"CN-16959" `	"That seems problematic. How do we get back?"`
	"CN-16960" `	"Did we destroy the universe by powering up this station?"`
	"CN-16961" `	Gavriil smiles with amusement. "It is certainly a possibility. However, the fact that it was, as best we can tell, powered up previously without destroying the universe suggests that it transported or isolated us rather than destroying everything else."`
	"CN-16962" `	They frown at the communication panel. "Although everything I know about quantum mechanics refuses to countenance something being able to leave the universe so absolutely like this." They smile again. "But that is the way of science! Finding new things in the universe that tells us that what we know is not so absolute."`
	"CN-16963" `	"I think we should focus on getting back."`
	"CN-16964" `	"Should we be worried?"`
	"CN-16965" `	Gavriil gestures neutrally. "Well, I am worried, of course. I would be devastated to find out I had destroyed humanity, and everything else in existence." They look somber, but then perk up again. "But if everything has been annihilated, there is nothing I can do about it. So I shall focus on learning what I can, doing what must be done, and enjoy the fact that the universe has inexplicably revealed once again that the sum of all our knowledge is merely the introductory metaphor to help us grasp how things work." Their gestures abruptly change tone. "Speaking of which, we need to report what we have learned to the rest, which means leaving this place."`
	"CN-16966" `	Gavriil gestures at the control panel in front of them. "I do not know for sure, but based on events, I suspect that if we manually induce a power failure we should be able to reverse the process that transported us to this realm." They smile eagerly. "I have everything all set up, and we have people waiting across the station." They look confident. "We think that we can safely spin down the reactor and cut power across a number of these arrays in a controlled fashion. This should replicate the original power failure, except with fewer risks and less damage to the system."`
	"CN-16967" `	They lead you over to a panel in the main loading dock. "I know, it says 'Job Board' on it. I reused the coding for our task list to improvise this mass-notification system." They smile in amusement. "When you are ready to go, just select the 'De-activate Array' option from the panel. That will notify everyone and begin the shutdown."`
	"CN-16968" `	They hand you a data crystal, and then a large case. "Here is an encrypted data crystal of all our data so far. The case has several sets, with the data stored in a variety of different mechanisms and encryptions. We do not know what happens when the station is activated or deactivated, so multiple formats for storing the data will give a better chance that at least some of it will remain intact to be delivered."`
	"CN-16969" `	They step back. "Well, I will return to the controls. Just give the signal when you are ready to leave. Embers light your path, Captain <first>."`
	"CN-16970" `With a shudder that is felt in every fiber of your being, you glimpse the ripple that makes reality look like the surface of a pond after a single rain drop. Almost before it begins, everything is still again. You look at your sensors, and it looks like Postverta has once again returned to its prior, barren, form.`
	"CN-16971" `With a shudder that is felt in every fiber of your being, you glimpse the ripple that makes reality look like the surface of a pond after a single rain drop. Almost before it begins, everything is still again. You look at your sensors, and it looks like Postverta is once again overflowing with life.`
	"CN-16972" `A crowd of Remnant cluster around your ship as you land, but it is just one who gestures quickly, asking if the rest of the team who went with you are safe. You nod, and a ripple of relief goes through the crowd. "So, what happened?" asks another.`
	"CN-16973" `	(Explain everything that happened.)`
	"CN-16974" `	"I think I should tell this to the prefects first."`
	"CN-16975" `	The Remnant around you look amused. "Do not be concerned, <first>. Everything you say will reach them. The sooner you tell us, the sooner we can start preparing for whatever is necessary."`
	"CN-16976" `	"I thought the prefects were your leaders?"`
	"CN-16977" `	"They bear our executive responsibilities, it is true. Times of critical threats require the capacity for decisions to be made in the instant. But do not confuse the authority to make high-value decisions with being in charge of everything. The less immediate a decision is, the more likely it is to be the product of significant discussion among us all. Likewise, decisions about what constitute the policy and values of our society are things decided upon by the unified whole, not any one individual." She pauses, and smiles. "Admittedly, given your involvement in smaller projects and unfolding events, our society probably does have a certain autocratic appearance."`
	"CN-16978" `	"Okay, I will explain everything."`
	"CN-16979" `	"How can you reach consensus so easily?"`
	"CN-16980" `	She looks around with an uncertain expression, then nods. "As I am sure has occurred to you, communication by gestures has some disadvantages. We still prefer it for some tasks, but it can be awkward to watch or gesture in the midst of some situations. While we have some vocabulary we can use without needing hands or arms, it is very limited.`
	"CN-16981" `	"Fortunately, one of the original abilities of our companions is related to the nervous system. I believe Dawn may have told you a little about it, but was scarce on details." She smiles wryly, then another Remnant takes up the conversation.`
	"CN-16982" `	"To put it simply, we can form ad-hoc neural networks between us, of varying levels of intensity. Without the necessity of speech or gestures, we can have entire conversations in the blink of an eye."`
	"CN-16983" `	He gestures confidently. "A team of Remnant, for instance, could all review incoming data from an experiment, form their own analyses, and then hold what amounts to a conference where each fully presents their thoughts and ideas with supporting data and reasoning within the span of a few minutes."`
	"CN-16984" `	His gestures take on a cautionary tone. "Of course, accelerating to that level takes effort, and it is a long process to learn to manage our thoughts in such a way as to have productive conversations. But the results speak for themselves." He gestures broadly at the group.`
	"CN-16985" `	"One such benefit is that in a policy debate, each person can be heard in depth, including checking the veracity of data and sources. This has significant benefits for minimizing the numbers of decisions made with incomplete or erroneous data, and maximizes the amount of information available to any one of us."`
	"CN-16986" `	A third Remnant steps up. "As to the matter at hand, this means that the sooner any of us hear your report, the sooner everyone will have heard it." They look at you expectantly.`
	"CN-16987" `	The Remnant smiles mysteriously. "A society has to have some secrets, does it not? Let us just say that our communication networks are very effective. At this point, just know that the sooner you give the report, the sooner that everyone will be able to work on this information." They pause, then continue. "And that does, of course, include the prefects."`
	"CN-16988" `	"Okay, I will explain what happened."`
	"CN-16989" `	"Alright, you convinced me."`
	"CN-16990" `	The Remnant watch you attentively as you explain everything that went on at Postverta and the surrounding area. Once you hand over the data crystals, one Remnant slots one of them into a console on the spot while another pair take the case with the rest and hustle off toward the information desk.`
	"CN-16991" `	As you reach the end of your report, one of the Remnant nods in approval. "We are starting to disseminate your report along with the data Dusk and Gavriil collected. Both copies of the data match, and have passed the initial verifications, so it appears they were not affected by your departing... shift."`
	"CN-16992" `	They look around at the surrounding Remnant, and you have the sudden feeling that there is an entire level of discussion happening around you. You spot Aeolus moving through the crowd to the front, and he gestures with tones of appreciation. "Thank you for all your work on this, <first>. We have a strong appreciation for the risks you have taken alongside us, and I hope we will continue to explore together. That being said, I suspect it will take much collective effort to determine our next course of action." He looks around, and then winks at you. "In the meantime, I have unlocked access to a few more bits of rarer Korath salvage, including access to captured 'olofezes. It is not much, but it may give you a little more ease of outfitting the <ship>."`
	"CN-16993" `	You are just settling down at a table in the cafeteria when Taely slides onto the bench opposite you. "Greetings, <first>. How is life as an adventurer?"`
	"CN-16994" `	"Exciting as always."`
	"CN-16995" `	"I am taking a break right now."`
	"CN-16996" `	She nods sympathetically. "Things have been a bit hectic lately, what with dimensional pockets and mysterious new aliens. I can understand wanting to slow down a bit. With the launch of two new ships in such a short time, I know I feel like I need to just relax a bit." She sighs. "It makes me feel guilty, honestly. I have accomplished so much, and there are so many things to be grateful for, but I even have more projects in development to focus on." She looks lost in thought for a moment.`
	"CN-16997" `	Taely looks up at you. "Could I ask you something about life back in ancestral space?"`
	"CN-16998" `	"Oh, maybe some other time, then." She looks disappointed, and settles in to eat.`
	"CN-16999" `	"I have been reading through the history archive you brought back, and I came across a mention of Vail." She shakes her head in amusement. "The idea of an entire planet devoted to hoverboarding and leisure activities seems so extravagant... Well, I am curious to visit it. Now, this is not a mission we are asking you to do, so I cannot offer any logistics compensation. I could, however, show you some of our history in exchange. Are you interested?"`
	"CN-17000" `	"Yes, that sounds fun."`
	"CN-17001" `	"Sure, I have done a bit of hoverboarding myself."`
	"CN-17002" `	"Really? The description sounded useful for exploration, and it looked challenging." Her commlink shifts to display a hologram of a hoverboarder executing a jump with an artistic poof of snow around them. "Anyway, I think this trip should be a good diversion for us both. I will meet you onboard the <ship> shortly."`
	"CN-17003" `	"Excellent. I will meet you onboard the <ship> shortly."`
	"CN-17004" `As you approach, your navigation system picks up the beacons designating the approach path, and before long you are automatically guided to a landing pad on the outskirts of the main spaceport.`
	"CN-17005" `As you approach Vail, the specialized sensors from your Remnant Research Laboratory detect parts of the weather control network tasked with increasing the amount of snowfall on the planet. Your navigation system picks up the beacons designating the approach path, and before too long you are automatically guided down to a landing pad on the outskirts of the main spaceport.`
	"CN-17006" `	Looking outside the ship, you can see a multitude of tourist-oriented facilities overwhelming the normal spaceport functions. You can pick out a small sign off to the side that indicates professional commodity and banking facilities, but otherwise the area is dominated by businesses offering mountain touring, sports classes, and vehicle rentals. Next to you, Taely alternates between peering out at the signs and reading brochures on a new commlink. "Here, <first>. This one sounds more interested in providing a challenge and less pampering. What do you think?"`
	"CN-17007" `	"Looks good to me."`
	"CN-17008" `	"Alright, should be good."`
	"CN-17009" `	The resort in question is a more exclusive facility, and is located away from the main train lines. You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where both you and Taely eventually develop sufficient skill to graduate from the easy runs up to the medium difficulty. You both fall repeatedly, but Taely's good humor is contagious as she takes the inevitable facefuls of snow in stride.`
	"CN-17010" `	The resort in question is a more exclusive facility, and is located away from the main train lines. You rent a hovercar from one of the rental companies and make the short trek out to the resort. The rest of the day is spent out on the slopes, where you teach Taely the basics of hoverboarding. By the end of the day Taely has impressed you with her quick learning and you finish off with a few runs down some of the more challenging slopes. Taely spills a few times, but she takes her failures in good humor, and never seems to make the same mistake twice.`
	"CN-17011" `	Heading back to the spaceport after a day of hoverboarding, Taely surprises you by pulling the hood open on the hovercar and spending almost an hour going over the internal systems before closing it up with a nod. "Well, that was interesting. The hovercar, I mean." She gestures at it with her commlink. "So many different manufacturers were involved in making this vehicle. Sometimes I wonder if humanity appreciates the luxury such diversity affords them." She looks thoughtful, then gestures toward the ship. "Well, <first>, I promised you a tour of a historic Remnant district. Caelian has perhaps the best example of one, so I would recommend we go there."`
	"CN-17012" `Taely directs you to a landing pad on the outskirts of the main spaceport, in an area that seems mostly filled with Gulls and Pelicans shifting larger quantities of products. Disembarking from the <ship>, she leads you down a large series of escalators that branch off in several directions, occasionally connecting with large ramps filled with steady streams of cargo traffic. After a few minutes they deposit you on a large platform.`
	"CN-17013" `	Approaching the edge of the platform, Taely puts out her arm to stop you from advancing any farther. "Watch out for the barrier," she says as she puts a hand out and touches something in mid-air in front of you. As she leans on it you can see faint ripples around her hand. "They are an essential safety feature, but they can still hurt if you run into them." She gestures to easily recognizable hazard markings on the floor. "With time you will learn to notice the faint shield ripples in the air, but meanwhile, just remember that anywhere that has the 'stand-back' lines on the floor likely has shields above it most of the time."`
	"CN-17014" `	Moments later, you see why the barriers are in place as a large train whooshes into the station at high speed before quickly coming to a stop. The barrier vanishes, and Taely leads you onto the train. Looking up and down the length of it, you can see hundreds, maybe even thousands of Remnant entering and exiting the train. Within moments the doors close, and the train starts moving again as you are pressed back into your seat. You see a few lights flicker past outside the window, but soon there is nothing outside but a monotonous dark blur.`
	"CN-17015" `	Taely notices your gaze. "Sorry, but there will not be much to see out there. The entire train line is quite far underground. Far enough to simply pass under terrain obstacles like rivers, valleys, or chasms." She nods to herself in satisfaction. "This will not be a long trip: we will only spend a few minutes at top speed before we start decelerating near our destination. I would recommend buckling into the harness."`
	"CN-17016" `	"I am looking forward to seeing where we are going."`
	"CN-17017" `	"How fast does this go?"`
	"CN-17018" `	"The C3-L0 Maglev has a maximum rated velocity of 11D.E78 meters per second, and can sustain that almost indefinitely so long as the track remains powered. In practice, it rarely maintains that velocity for more than a few minutes at a time, as it is a local transport train. We do have some that go faster, but the amount of acceleration required to make use of them on short tracks is not terribly practical." She looks wistful. "Many people are working on solving the inertia problem, but Embers only know when that will result in something practical."`
	"CN-17019" `	"Interesting. How long until we arrive?"`
	"CN-17020" `	"Why is that number so precise?"`
	"CN-17021" `	"That sounds like the speed of light."`
	"CN-17022" `	Taely smiles. "After all the safety factors, margins for error, and assorted other adjustments were taken into account, someone noticed that, when expressed in scientific notation, the coefficient of the rated value was calculated to be 1.1DE79, a fraction above the coefficient of the speed of light in a vacuum, so they adjusted the rated maximum velocity down only slightly so that they would match."`
	"CN-17023" `	"What is a coefficient?"`
	"CN-17024" `	"What is scientific notation?"`
	"CN-17025" `	"Here, I will switch to base 10 to make it easier for you to understand." She pulls up a hologram with 299,792,458 m/s on it. As she speaks, the number shifts to 2.99792458x10^8 m/s. "When we write out a number such as the speed of light, it is typical to break it into parts. This is generally referred to as scientific notation. This is done to facilitate comparing and working with large numbers. The first part, 2.99792458 in this case, would be called the coefficient. The second part, x10, is called the base; and the third part, ^8 is the exponent." The display shifts again to show 1.1DE784Ax10^7 m/s. "So this would be how we typically write the speed of light when we are using it in our research. So, 1.1DE78 is the coefficient of both the speed of light and the speed of the train, just with a different exponent." She pauses, then vanishes the display. "We will be arriving momentarily, so I should probably stop there."`
	"CN-17026" `	After several minutes, the lights in the train car suddenly pulse several times, and the train starts to decelerate heavily. You can feel yourself pushing into the harness as the train slows and comes to a stop. Unbuckling, Taely leads you out onto the platform, and then up a long escalator to the surface. Emerging into the sunlight, you find yourself looking around at a scene that seems almost anachronistic.`
	"CN-17027" `	Taely looks around with pride, and then watches your reaction with amusement.`
	"CN-17028" `	"I do not know what to make of this."`
	"CN-17029" `	"This is a spaceport?"`
	"CN-17030" `	She nods, and guides you amongst the stream of camel-drawn hovercarts heading for the gate. "This is one of our earliest spaceports, before we learned new techniques better suited to our new home. Our founding ships brought as much as they could, of course, but as it turns out, the earliest phases of expansion look much the same, whether one is looking at historic pre-flight eras or modern settlement efforts."`
	"CN-17031" `	"It still seems odd to see camels pulling levitating platforms."`
	"CN-17032" `	"Stone walls seem like an odd thing to build."`
	"CN-17033" `	"Are those wind turbines?"`
	"CN-17034" `	"All these wood products seem surprising."`
	"CN-17035" `	"I think I have seen enough."`
	"CN-17036" `	Taely picks up a board from a nearby pile. "We were fortunate that Caelian had some vegetation that could be used like this. The native vegetation is biologically quite different from the trees of Earth, but they have similar structural characteristics and grow plentifully in many areas." She offers you the board. "The decision was made early on that anything that could be made from locally sourced materials, should be sourced locally. We wanted to conserve our limited supplies of metals and other rare resources for things that required it." She taps on a barrel. "These are a prime example - a few metal straps enable the wood to hold a significant amount of liquid. It is much the same as how a comparatively small amount of bone in our bodies can provide the necessary structure for a large volume of soft tissues and organs to function."`
	"CN-17037" `	"Is that so? The engineering advantages are quite simple: with the mechanics of the cart focused entirely on supporting the load and the camel providing horizontal motion, the cart can support much larger masses than it could if it had to split the forces." She looks wistful. "In truth, I am somewhat envious of the industrial capacity the ancestral worlds contain - we have accomplished much, but we have had to make choices, and one of those was the decision as to where to spend our industrial capacity. We chose, obviously, to focus on spacecraft and heavy industrial applications. We have no cars, no personal vehicles at all, really. Even these hovercarts are basically the repulsor systems from our spacecraft that have been repurposed to carry massive loads."`
	"CN-17038" `	Taely gestures out through the gate at the distant landscape. "It is ironic that, in many respects, the distant stars are more accessible to us than the metaphorical far side of the mountain. Those of us who explore our worlds often resort to long expeditions with camel trains to carry all their scientific equipment. Spending months away from friends or family while on a project is commonplace, even for those who never leave the surface of our planets. Many of our explorers, in fact, live nomadic lifestyles - moving every couple of weeks to a new research location as they study, document, and analyze the world." Her gestures take on a reverent tone. "Many of our most important discoveries can be attributed to these explorers."`
	"CN-17039" `	Her tone shifts to one of amusement. "We were lucky, though. Our camels were able to sustain themselves on several categories of local vegetation right from the start. It took quite a bit of experimentation with bacterial cultures, however, before we were able to enable them to really forage properly. Now they thrive here. Some experts suspect that, if we were to ever leave, the camels would probably continue to survive here for millennia to come."`
	"CN-17040" `	Taely's expression becomes mournful as she leads you over to the walls. "We discovered soon after we arrived here that this planet was not as safe as it appeared. It had a variety of natural predators, including swarms of predatory creatures that were very aggressive in hunting us. They preferred darkness, and while they had excellent eyesight, their hearing was even sharper. A swarm could triangulate the position of a person from a single spoken word at great distances."`
	"CN-17041" `	She gestures up at the edge of the wall. "Fortunately, we discovered that while they were quite competent climbers, they could not navigate overhangs. So while such lips are generally considered a structural vulnerability when defending against modern weapons, they are indispensable for containing local wildlife. These walls served as well later on, too, when we had to deal with Korath ground attacks and other more complex threats."`
	"CN-17042" `	"They are indeed wind turbines." She steps through the gate to a spot with a better view. You can see that while the ones on the wall are only a couple of meters tall, the ones on top of the towers are significantly bigger. "Our ancestors rightly guessed that anywhere that had sufficient atmosphere to dispense with pressure suits would also have wind. The vertical style also has the advantage that it handles high wind speeds and rapid variation in direction much better than some of the shapes that were more traditional at the time of the exodus. It seems to be a good precaution, as it has enabled these to survive the harsh windstorms that can sweep across the continent. While they have been repaired and improved over the centuries, these wind turbines still provide sufficient power for much of the agricultural uses out here, so we let them continue. They are also useful to remind us from where we have come."`
	"CN-17043" `	Taely leads you around the area for a few more hours, pointing out historical features, places where they resurrected trades and skills from before the advent of flight, and other interesting things. Eventually she heads back to the train station, which deposits you back in the main spaceport.`
	"CN-17044" `	"I hope you enjoyed the tour, <first>. It was interesting to see our history through fresh eyes." She smiles mischievously. "And I enjoyed the hoverboarding, too. Maybe we can do it again sometime." She pauses for a moment, focusing on something you cannot see. "Looks like duty calls. Embers guide your way, Captain <last>." She waves, and heads off into the crowd.`
	"CN-17045" `You stop by the starport just in time to see a large group of Remnant departing. A few of the nearest notice your interest and begin gesturing recognition or various invitations to accompany them, but before you are able to respond, Taely appears from the stream of people and approaches you.`
	"CN-17046" `	"Well met, <first>. We were just going to the monthly Celebration of Remembrance. Would you like to accompany us?"`
	"CN-17047" `	"Yes, I would."`
	"CN-17048" `	She nods. "Well, may the Embers guide you, <first>." With that, she rejoins the stream of people as they vanish from sight.`
	"CN-17049" `	"The Celebration of Remembrance is a gathering; we take a moment to remember where we have come from, appreciate where we are, and express hope for where we will be in the future." Her gestures take on a critical tone. "That sounds very formal, but it is more artistic than defined." She glances at the slowing flow of people. "It will be starting shortly, and I want to attend this month, so I should get moving. Would you like to join us?"`
	"CN-17050" `	As the two of you join the flow of people, Taely gestures once again. "If you would like, I could provide you with some commentary and explanation, but it is more about feeling than doing anything specific. Together, we remember and celebrate through free-form dance mixed with singing and music. You are welcome to participate, but try not to disrupt or impede others in the way you join the dancing."`
	"CN-17051" `	"No, that is alright. I will just experience it."`
	"CN-17052" `	"Yes, that would be appreciated."`
	"CN-17053" `	The crowd you have joined merges with other flows of people as you all stream onward, eventually emerging from the typical hallways into a massive cave. On one side, a large opening, framed by rough stone and a handful of shield emitters, looks up towards the night sky. Stalagmites with matching stalactites above them ring the perimeter of the room, but there is no sound of drips or traces of lingering moisture here. While the walls are still rough, natural stone, the floor and all the stalagmites have been polished smooth. With a quick glance, you estimate that there are already over a hundred people in here, and more are still filtering in around you and through several other doors. Taely leads you through the crowd, frequently gesturing greetings to those she passes by.`
	"CN-17054" `	Taely gestures quietly to you. "We start with the ritual query and response asking if we are safe. Safe in this moment, at least."`
	"CN-17055" `	Without warning the room stills, and all the doors close. A flurry of gestures washes out from the center of the room, as if everyone is repeating what someone has said, but you cannot see anyone starting it. "Perimeter secure?" comes the gestured question, followed by an answering ripple from the edges of the room back toward the center: "All clear."`
	"CN-17056" `	Suddenly, you become aware of a drum beat building in the silence, and then realize that it had already started with the first ripple of gestures, so quiet that, until now, it was unnoticeable. The beat builds gradually: a slow, steady rhythm.`
	"CN-17057" `	"Thump."`
	"CN-17058" `	(Look around the room.)`
	"CN-17059" `	(Move in time with the beat.)`
	"CN-17060" `	At your side, Taely gestures again. "Existence starts with the patterns of the universe, and our story starts with life."`
	"CN-17061" `	The beat echoes in the cavern, but you quickly manage to locate the source: an elderly Remnant using her hands to drum against a polished stalagmite that, judging by the resonance, appears to be hollow. As you watch, a child steps up next to her and starts also hitting the rock with their palms, slightly off-beat, changing the pattern into a hauntingly familiar one:`
	"CN-17062" `	"Thump-thump."`
	"CN-17063" `	Looking around the room you can see people starting to move in time with the beat. Some are swaying, and some are nodding their heads or tapping their feet. Standing next to you, Taely has a hand on her heart, tapping softly. Soon you hear other drummers join in as the beat resonates throughout the room. Now people are not merely swaying to the beat, but dancing. Some spin in place, others rock back and forth between different stances, and a few have joined hands and begun moving in a circle. Everywhere you look there are people dancing in countless variations.`
	"CN-17064" `	Out of the chaos you hear a voice rise in song. You cannot make out what it is saying, but it carries the tones of anticipation. You can, however, clearly decipher a chant from many other voices, cutting through the solo voice in time with the drumming:`
	"CN-17065" `	Out of the chaos you hear a voice rise in song. You cannot make out what it is saying, but it carries the tones of anticipation. You can, however, clearly decipher a chant from many other voices, cutting through the solo voice in time with the drumming but not overwhelming either:`
	"CN-17066" `	"...6...5...4...Ignition...2...1...Liftoff!"`
	"CN-17067" `	(Look around with anticipation.)`
	"CN-17068" `	(Look around nervously.)`
	"CN-17069" `	Taely notices your anxiety and gestures reassuringly: "All is well."`
	"CN-17070" `	Taely notices your anxiety and gestures reassuringly. "They sing of the days of humanity's infancy; when we first ventured out of the cradle."`
	"CN-17071" `	On the final word the chant ends and dozens of deep voices join together in a roaring crescendo before fading away, replaced by many new voices expressing tones of wonder. At this point, it seems that almost every single person in the room is drumming, dancing, or singing - many seem to be doing several simultaneously.`
	"CN-17072" `	As the stars wheel through the night sky above the mouth of the cave, you note the flow of the ceremony seems to be telling a story of some kind. You understand very few snippets of words, but the emotion conveyed in the singing is clear. The early tone of anticipation shifts to the roar of excitement and then on to a peaceful tone of wonder.`
	"CN-17073" `	As the ceremony continues, this shifts again to a steady, almost mechanical feel, which is in turn abruptly penetrated by a piercing thread of excitement, leading to the entire tone of the song becoming one of curiosity over another driving beat. The melody then seems to wander more, caught in dual tones of regret and anticipation, mourning and rejoicing, terror and hope, disorder and structure, disappointment and awe, and countless other deeply emotional pairings before finally culminating in a return to the original, unified heartbeat as the singers' voices come together, reaching upwards in hope before finally everything trails off into silence.`
	"CN-17074" `	Through it all, Taely offers a running commentary on how each stretch of the ceremony represents a different piece of their collective history, ranging from the launch of the first human into space to its commercialization and then the new age of exploration opened by the advent of hyperdrives. It also includes numerous conflicts, disasters, and wars. Much of it is rather familiar to you from what you know of human history, but the later part is strange and unfamiliar. Filled with stories of first contact, strange ruins, alien invasions, desperate last stands, and brilliant discoveries, you are left with the impression that, despite the Remnant's current security, they have been on the precipice of extinction for much of their existence.`
	"CN-17075" `	(Stand still and absorb the moment.)`
	"CN-17076" `	(Look around to see what is happening next.)`
	"CN-17077" `	Around you, everyone has gone still. Most look exhausted, and some are sitting on the floor or leaning against the walls. A few people look like they have been crying, and those nearby are hugging them or simply touching their shoulder. Most of the people you can see have reverent and joyful expressions. After the silence lingers for what feels like several minutes, the doors open and people start to leave. In short order the cave is nearly empty.`
	"CN-17078" `	"I always find these Celebrations of Remembrance to be invigorating," Taely says. "What did you think of it, <first>?"`
	"CN-17079" `	"I think I will have to get back to you on that later."`
	"CN-17080" `	"That was awe-inspiring."`
	"CN-17081" `	"Why were some of the people crying?"`
	"CN-17082" `	"Who leads these ceremonies?"`
	"CN-17083" `	"That seemed both well-rehearsed and very disorganized."`
	"CN-17084" `	"You said 'virtually.' Who is omitted?"`
	"CN-17085" `	"What constitutes your most serious crimes?"`
	"CN-17086" `	Taely smiles at that. "Well, it is and it is not. We hold these several times a month, though most people take part in only one every few weeks. Most of us have attended hundreds of these. Although as far as that goes, every one of these celebrations is different. Each person's participation and style is entirely up to them, so the details and feel of the group celebration as a whole are unique every time." After explaining this, she makes a singular gesture you have come to realize encompasses the idea, "If you have more questions, ask them."`
	"CN-17087" `	Taely's gestures take on a tone of conviction. "For something like this, or anything of a social or spiritual nature for that matter, we determine who takes the lead for various parts at the moment, based on who is present. Whether we are talking about our connection with society, or our connection to the Universe, we must each forge our own understanding of it. As such, when we gather together for ceremonies such as this, virtually anyone could be chosen to take the lead for one of the segments.`
	"CN-17088" `	"As a result, each celebration takes on a different feel - after all, each of us has our own unique perspective, and bring our own experiences to contribute." She pauses, and adopts a respectful tone. "The ceremony is not just about major events, either. Everyone who takes part brings their own life experiences and memories to the story we tell. Memories of friends and family who are no longer with us are common as well."`
	"CN-17089" `	Taely scowls a bit at this. "Only those guilty of the most serious crimes cannot stand as a lead." She pauses, and continues with an amused tone. "Even children take the lead now and then, usually with a parent or sibling to guide them." She smiles at that, then gestures for you to continue asking your questions.`
	"CN-17090" `	Taely gestures harshly. "Crimes against society, of course. Acting against the best interest of our collective well-being is the single most destructive and senseless act someone can perpetrate."`
	"CN-17091" `	Taely gestures gently. "Many were friends of the crew of a ship that was recently destroyed while studying a black hole. They acquired ground-breaking data from it, but perished in the process. Their friends and families are proud of them, of course, but that does not change the fact that they are lost to us mortals. Sometimes the whole experience is simply overwhelming, and some of us still sorrow for other losses in our stories."`
	"CN-17092" `	Taely nods in agreement and simply gestures expansively at the cavern around you, giving you a few moments to contemplate it. Eventually she gestures asking if you have any further questions.`
	"CN-17093" `	Taely strides over to a console near the closest door and retrieves a crystal from a compartment within. She slips it into a case and turns back to you. "Our celebrations are something that bind us together, and we share in both the memory of the departed and the hope for the future. As such, we keep recordings of them so that those who are not present at a particular event may still experience it too. This recording is destined for those working in Postverta, as a friend of one of those being mourned today is stationed there. Could you deliver this to them please?"`
	"CN-17094" `	She looks disappointed, but merely shrugs and pockets the crystal. "I will find someone else to transport this, then."`
	"CN-17095" `When you arrive on Postverta there is a small group of Remnant waiting at the landing bay for you. As you hand the crystal to one, another gestures, "Thank you for bringing this to us, Captain <first>. Being able to join in the Remembrance will help me to celebrate those who have gone on before." The group heads off into the depths of the station, leaving you in the bay.`
	"CN-17096" `	Taely never mentioned anything about compensation, but as soon as the Remnant leave, your commlink notifies you that you have been assigned <payment>.`
	"CN-17097" `You note a disturbance in the shipyards before the <ship> even touches the ground. Every pad is filled with ships, camels pulling wagon trains loaded with canisters trundle out of the outfitter, and technicians clamber everywhere. As you step out of your ship, Taely slides down the side of a Merganser resting next to you.`
	"CN-17098" `	"Good timing, Captain! We just rolled out an upgrade to some of our oldest equipment, and our Mergansers finally have something to carry as first-strike weapons. Interested in taking a look?"`
	"CN-17099" `	"Sorry, but I'm a bit busy at the moment."`
	"CN-17100" `	She turns and heads towards a nearby lift where another crew of Remnant had just moved several EMP Torpedo canisters into place. "Well, you have probably seen us use EMP Torpedoes now and then, right? Well, as you probably noticed, they have a few tactical issues. They are slow, they often hit our ships almost as much as our targets, and they take up space we could otherwise be using for more important things like laboratories or scanners." She taps a few commands into the console, and the lift begins raising the canisters towards the waiting ship.`
	"CN-17101" `	"Over the past decades we have had a few teams working on improving them from different angles. Some focused on the torpedoes themselves, others focused on the launcher. The surprising development, however, was from a team working down in the Warren. They figured out a way to shave a few cubic meters off the systems that assemble the torpedoes, and compress the whole structure. Very impressive work, and the results should be in the outfitter for you in the next day or two."`
	"CN-17102" `	She looks at you and nods contemplatively. "One thing worth noting - you are making great strides in learning our language, so new items that appear in our outfitter will be listed under their proper name instead of substitutes from the ancestral tongue."`
	"CN-17103" `	"Whatever makes things easier for everyone."`
	"CN-17104" `	"Thanks. What names were changed?"`
	"CN-17105" `	She looks amused. "Mainly weapons. If something is named an adjective that describes what it does, then it was a name we made up on the spot to include in the linguistic overlay we put in place for the displays. We did that so that you would have an easier time understanding what something does. Thankfully, you no longer need such aides."`
	"CN-17106" `	"Thanks! Circling back to our earlier topic, what does 'Warren' mean?"`
	"CN-17107" `	"It is our term for the network of caves, tunnels, and spaces deep underground. All three of our main worlds have them in some form or another. We know a little about the original people who built them, but not nearly as much as we would like. They called themselves the Zitchal Maudrakoi, and one of the most distinguishing features we have been able to learn about them is that they do not seem to attach much importance to directionality. For example, in a control room we found, there were instruments and controls on every available surface, with just a scattering of handholds to support the operator." She shrugs. "Plume or Dusk would know more than I about them. I mostly focus on understanding their equipment."`
	"CN-17108" `	"Well, I should get back to work, then. Next time you are in space, take a look at how our ships fare in battle. Hopefully you will see an improvement." She grabs a couple components from a nearby lift, and scrambles back up the side of the Merganser to continue working on a new bay.`
	"CN-17109" `Now that the most recent Korath raiders have been defeated, you decide to check your sensor logs to see how the new EMP Torpedoes Taely talked about performed. You note that the EMP bursts no longer have an impact on friendly ships. This could make them much more versatile.`
	"CN-17110" `You recall Taely mentioning something about new weaponry, so you decide to check your logs to see what your sensors have recorded lately. Looking over the most recent combat details, you note that the EMP bursts no longer have an impact on friendly ships. This could make them much more versatile.`
	"CN-17111" `Looking around the Viminal spaceport, you spot Taely using something that slightly resembles a small catapult to launch a sizable rock across the cavern. A nearby Merganser leaps into the air and chases after it, pouncing on the rock and vanishing from sight before reappearing next to Taely, dropping it next to her. Without looking away from the Merganser she waves you over.`
	"CN-17112" `	"Well met, <first>, how goes your travels? Found anything interesting?"`
	"CN-17113" `	She listens to your description of the encounter with the ghostly ship whilst looking at the recording you pull up from your commlink. "This is very intriguing. I will need to consult a few people. If you are interested in investigating this, ensure your ship has a Research Laboratory installed, and meet me in the spaceport."`
	"CN-17114" `Your arrival in the spaceport finds Taely in deep conversation with an elderly Remnant, empty food trays cluttering the table before them. They both turn when you approach, breaking off their conversation.`
	"CN-17115" `	"Thank you for coming, Captain <last>. I would like to introduce you to Ruach. She was a shipyard engineering prefect for many decades, but now spends most of her time as a teacher."`
	"CN-17116" `	Ruach gives a polite bow. "Taely lays too many compliments on me," she gestures with amusement. "I fulfilled my duty doing the best with that which the Embers blessed me, nothing more, nothing less. But it has been rewarding watching someone take everything I taught them and fly with it to heights I could only dream of."`
	"CN-17117" `	Ruach's gestures take on a more precise cadence. "Taely tells me that you have spotted a strange 'ghost' in Caeculus that bears a resemblance to ancestral ships. Could you take me to do a scan of it please?"`
	"CN-17118" `Ruach pores over the scanning arrays before reporting that the subject is not present. She suggests searching nearby systems to locate it.`
	"CN-17119" `The <ship> hasn't even settled onto the landing pad when Ruach leaps down from the airlock and jogs a couple of spots down to stare up at the gills of an Albatross. A few moments later, Taely drops out of them, greeting Ruach warmly. By the time you join them, Ruach has a hologram of the spectral ship floating in the air. "It is lacking the confirmation codes or identification info, but I am confident that this is it," muses Ruach as you arrive.`
	"CN-17120" `	"Sorry for leaving you behind, <first>, but this is just such an exciting discovery. This ship you found matches the profile of the Shattered Light - a large city ship that was part of the Exodus but never arrived on this side of the wormhole. There are so many questions to be answered! Anyway, the data is being distributed right now. Meet me in the cafeteria in a few hours to see what ideas have come up. Oh, and before I forget, we have allotted you <payment> for your assistance."`
	"CN-17121" `A group of people huddled around a hologram catches your attention, drawing your eyes to Ruach who gestures for you to join them. She introduces you to each person, before thanking you. "I would just like to start by offering our thanks for your assistance, Captain <first>. You have sharp eyes to pick this up as early as you did." She gestures to the hologram of the ship floating in front of you. "Other scouts reported it shortly thereafter, but you spotted it first.`
	"CN-17122" `	"We have confirmed that this matches all available records of the Shattered Light, although it appears to have suffered considerable damage. One of the oldest mysteries here is what has happened to it, and what we should do about it."`
	"CN-17123" `	Another Remnant steps forward and the hologram changes to show a scene from a cave with a large object. Other Remnant appear to aim some equipment at it, and after a moment or two, the object expands to several times its original size. "These are recordings from our explorations of the ruins, demonstrating the decompression of a Maudrakoi artifact. While not identical, these artifacts generate similar readings to those recorded during your scan of the Shattered Light.`
	"CN-17124" `	"As such, our proposition is to use the same equipment we used for decompression to stabilize the Shattered Light's weft field, and, if possible, bring it fully into synchronicity once again." She nods firmly, clapping her hands together to make the hologram vanish.`
	"CN-17125" `	Ruach takes the lead again. "So, Captain, we will need you to bring us in close to the Shattered Light so we can give this a try. Our sentries have reported seeing it in the systems near Coluber, so it may take some searching."`
	"CN-17126" `	"Looks good. Start loading the <ship>!"`
	"CN-17127" `	"Wait, 'Maudrakoi'?"`
	"CN-17128" `	The Remnant who showed the video looks startled, and then embarrassed. "My apologies, I did not realize you had not been familiarized with them." She looks around the room, then gestures. The hologram returns, now showing a large room with many shelves around the edge and several large objects within it, including some that look like Point Defense Turrets.`
	"CN-17129" `	"We do not have time for an in-depth presentation, but the short version is this: the Maudrakoi are the primary civilization that lived on these worlds before we arrived. They are not the only civilization to have lived here, but they are the one we find most often in the archaeological record. Fortunately for our research, it seems that they lived extensively underground in complexes such as this one."`
	"CN-17130" `	Her gestures take on an appreciative tone. "The Maudrakoi made extensive use of the materials that make our ships and architecture so distinctive, and this has allowed their cities and technologies to survive the eons since they went extinct. One technology of note is they had an interesting ability to manipulate space. They used this to make large, highly complex objects, and then, for lack of a better term, partially embed them in pocket dimensions so as to not be entirely present. They used this frequently to allow equipment and materials to be much smaller than normal." She shrugs, and gestures with a frustrated tone. "We cannot replicate it, but we have figured out how to disrupt the compression, and thus recover the artifact."`
	"CN-17131" `	The hologram shifts back to showing the Shattered Light. "This ship does not show the same signatures as the Maudrakoi artifacts, but we think it is sufficiently similar that our equipment should work on it too. Hopefully. In any case, though, time is passing, so we should start loading." With that, the Remnant gather their equipment and head out.`
	"CN-17132" `As the scan results arrive the data is relayed down to the team in the cargo hold. Your video feed shows a large hologram of the system floating in midair above one of the pallets. Nearby, terminals flash rolling readouts and analyses. As the data on the spectral ship solidifies, cones of projected courses appear on the display. Line by line the cone tightens in as additional data flows from your telemetry, closing in on a path intersecting with the nearby world.`
	"CN-17133" `	While the system continues to refine the orbital paths, the team seemed disinclined to wait: Ruach activates her commlink, broadcasting quickly to you. "It is on a crash course for Far Monad!" she exclaims. "Quick, land there!" Behind her, you can see her team scrambling to move equipment around near your cargo door and seal their spacesuits.`
	"CN-17134" `With the Shattered Light careening towards the surface of Far Monad, you push the <ship> into a dive. As you focus on finding a safe place to land within close proximity of the approaching ship, you notice out the corner of your eye that the Remnant team have all suited up and are pushing their equipment to the cargo hatch. A message appears on your console.`
	"CN-17135" `	"Ready for drop, Captain. Just get us alongside the Shattered Light without too much forward velocity. We can handle the rest."`
	"CN-17136" `	Moments later you spot a gaping hole on the ship. Focusing on it, you fly the <ship> down and hold position just above it. A glance at your cargo hold display shows the Remnant vanishing out the back lock. Your exterior cameras show the equipment falling into it on repulsor pallets while the Remnant drop alongside it. A final message appears on your console.`
	"CN-17137" `	Moments later the <ship> pings a point on the Shattered Light indicating a gaping hole on the ship. Nodding your assent, your ship swoops to a hold position just above it. A glance at your cargo hold display shows the Remnant vanishing out the back lock. Your exterior cameras show the equipment falling into the hole on repulsor pallets while the Remnant drop alongside it. A final message appears on your console.`
	"CN-17138" `	"Drop success. Get clear of the arrival zone and pick us up after the dust settles."`
	"CN-17139" `	With their confirmation, you quickly pull away from the approaching wreck and retreat to a safe distance.`
	"CN-17140" `	The <ship> veers and accelerates away from the approaching wreck without waiting for your approval and retreats to a safe distance.`
	"CN-17141" `	Eventually, you find a good vantage point, several kilometers away, where you can watch the approaching ship. The Shattered Light falls through the sky with deceptive slowness, made all the worse by the fact that you can see clouds and sky passing through it. As it nears the surface you see a ripple in the air explode out from it, followed by a concussive shockwave as the Shattered Light suddenly becomes very solid. Its engines flare to life with a roar that rattles your bones and the ship lurches to a stop in mid-air, before crunching down into the forest.`
	"CN-17142" `	The dust and debris settle within a few minutes, and soon you and the <ship> are skimming over the vegetation. The approach gives you ample time to appreciate just how massive the Shattered Light is; everything that one could need to lay the foundations for a new colony is packed into a single ship. You note large gashes in the hull, massive sensor arrays, and a shattered dome on top. Based on the mismatch of parts, this ship has been substantially modified from its original hull, and survived untold damage.`
	"CN-17143" `	As you slow to a hover alongside the ship, Ruach appears on your viewscreen. "Well met, Captain! Our theory worked! We managed to snap the Shattered Light back into the Primary Weft, and are now onboard. The systems are dubious, though, so we dare not shut anything down lest we cannot restart it. We would appreciate your assistance in escorting us back to Viminal."`
	"CN-17144" `The Shattered Light is so massive that traffic control directs you to a large valley next to the spaceport, where you discover that a section of the chasm has been covered to create a semi-enclosed area. Judging from the equipment and stacks of cargo, this area looks like it is predominantly used by bulk freight shipments and little else. Now, however, as the Shattered Light slowly moves in, a flock of Pelicans scatter in front of it looking like nothing more than a flock of plovers in front of an approaching camel.`
	"CN-17145" `	Down on the ground, you see Ruach and her team exit an airlock on the side of the Shattered Light and jump down to the ground. They gather around, giving hugs. "<first>!" exclaims Ruach. "We have recovered a lost piece of Remnant history. Thank you for helping. I do not know what this will mean for us in the long term, but there will be a lot of careful examination for the next few weeks."`
	"CN-17146" `	"I have things to do, so just let me know if I can help."`
	"CN-17147" `	"So, what happened?"`
	"CN-17148" `	The team of Remnant are almost too excited for you to understand their gestures, but one calms down enough that their signing is comprehensible. "To be honest, we were expecting this to be the first of several trips doing detailed scans and trying out different sorts of synchronization fields. But when we saw that it was heading to the planet..." She trails off, and another one continues. "We already had the sensors running as we approached, so we jumped and triggered the fields as soon as we got a reasonable match."`
	"CN-17149" `	He frowns a bit. "It worked, although not perfectly. There are chunks missing, some of which seriously impair its functionality. But it is back in the Primary Weft, so now we have time to work on it and figure out what happened to it."`
	"CN-17150" `	"I think I get the picture. Let me know if I can help."`
	"CN-17151" `	"What is this 'Primary Weft' you have mentioned?"`
	"CN-17152" `	Another Remnant steps forward. "The Weft is what we term the mesh of dimensions, energy, and time that form a subset of the universe. A layer, of sorts." He looks thoughtful. "What you probably know as 'Hyperspace' is what we technically call the Secondary Weft. There are a few others we are fairly confident exist, and several that we have hypothesized might exist but we have no means of confirming. Practically, each of these overlaps with the Primary Weft to some extent." His gestures take on an amused tone. "Of course, what we call the Primary Weft is only primary to those of us who live here. For all we know, there may be people living elsewhere that consider their own weft to be the primary one. Nothing says ours is special or the best or anything of the sort. Actually, it has been proposed that we call the Primary Weft the Warp. It is an old weaving term that serves as a reasonable analogy to how the warp and weft interact, and might better reflect its status instead of being labeled 'Primary.'`
	"CN-17153" `	"In terms of help, could you go to Caelian? We have sent word ahead, and our engineers are retrieving some of our remaining equipment from the time of the Exodus. We are hoping that it might be of use to help us repair the Shattered Light, or at least understand what happened to it.`
	"CN-17154" `	"Before you leave, though, there was some stuff that survived intact we would like to share with you." Behind her five androids emerge from one of the cargo holds, each one carrying a large trunk of equipment.`
	"CN-17155" `	"These are known as NDR-114 Androids, and were cutting edge innovations back when the Exodus occurred. Don't expect too much of them. They are not self-aware, sentient, or even particularly advanced artificial intelligences. They are, however, excellent extensions of a ship's self-maintenance systems. As it turns out, a large number of these androids were instrumental in keeping the Shattered Light flying all these years. We have plenty to study, so we thought you might appreciate having a few." She makes a dismissive gesture. "If they end up not being helpful for you, our outfitters will be able to re-assign them to another ship.`
	"CN-17156" `	"Embers light your path, Captain <first>." With that, the crowd disperses.`
	"CN-17157" `On <origin>, the spaceport is awash in conversation, and you spot snippets here and there of people talking about the recovery of the Shattered Light. Many are speculating as to what happened to it in the first place, while others are discussing the technical merits of what the research team did to recover it. Details travel quickly, it seems.`
	"CN-17158" `	The team you are sent to pick up are waiting next to the information desk. They have a collection of pallets nearby, and a small crowd is gathered around them in animated conversation. They spot you and the crowd start waving their goodbyes as the group pick up their bags and head towards you.`
	"CN-17159" `	"Ah, <first>! Thank you for transporting us. We are excited to see the Shattered Light and start studying this mystery you have found." They briskly head to your ship.`
	"CN-17160" `The Remnant spend the trip busily discussing what is known so far and exchanging theories, eagerly asking you questions about what you saw and reviewing your sensor records. By the time you reach Viminal, they have a whole collection of theories and have a preliminary plan of what studies they hope to do. When pressed, however, they all acknowledge that their top priority will be documenting the ship. Every scratch, every oddly charged component, every minor modification. "After all," they say, "knowing how it is now is the first step to determining how it arrived here."`
	"CN-17161" `	The entire complement of Remnant crowd the windows when you settle into the final approach for the covered valley that houses the Shattered Light. You can see that the Remnant have been busy setting up large equipment towers around it, including several small encampments of tents. As you settle in for a landing, you see a camel team maneuver a sled with a large anti-aircraft battery into position, where it is promptly shrouded in a tent that blends into the rest of the camp.`
	"CN-17162" `	Traffic control directs you to a pad near a large door of the Shattered Light. Ruach and a small group of Remnant are gathered around a hologram of the ship, and seem to be co-ordinating teams exploring it. Large mounds of equipment appear to have expanded from the sides of the ship, some of which appears to be functional. As you go through your landing checks, the team thank you for the transportation and begin offloading their equipment.`
	"CN-17163" `	"Welcome back, <first>!" signs Ruach from across the pad. "We have made considerable progress already." She appears set to explain what they have discovered.`
	"CN-17164" `	"Great, but please spare me the details."`
	"CN-17165" `	"You figured out what happened? Great!"`
	"CN-17166" `	She looks crestfallen. "Well, we know what the ship thinks happened, anyway. It is likely that what actually happened differs significantly." Her posture takes on a more positive stance. "We have had the opportunity to start querying the onboard systems and piece together a little of the Shattered Light's history. Particularly the logs.`
	"CN-17167" `	"As we all know, it was part of the Exodus fleet that entered the Terminus wormhole. Unlike most of the other ships, however, it never emerged from the other side. Fortunately, it had a significantly larger array of instruments than was normal for ships of its type, and it looks like at least some of the databanks survived."`
	"CN-17168" `	At this point another Remnant takes up the narrative. "Based on the initial incident logs, it appears that something in the stabilization fields failed during transit. The data is not clear whether the systems failed, or if something in the wormhole fluctuations exceeded the parameters that the systems could handle. In any case, the ship appears to have been shunted laterally from the wormhole in mid-transit.`
	"CN-17169" `	"It is unclear what happened after that, but the ship was subject to significant forces including unidentified impacts that caused multiple system failures. The data loses some coherence at this point, but it basically seems to have been semi-permanently stuck out-of-phase with the prime weft until an energy surge destabilized it and it wobbled back into prime coherence. At that point, it started being visible again, and shortly after, you spotted it."`
	"CN-17170" `	"Interesting. Well, let me know if I can help."`
	"CN-17171" `	"I am curious as to what you will do now."`
	"CN-17172" `	"The first step will be to unpack the Shattered Light and set up all its equipment. Taking detailed scans of each piece as we do so, of course." She gestures around at the equipment expanding out of the side of the ship. "As you can see, we have already started the process and found that much of it is operational."`
	"CN-17173" `	One of the other Remnant continues. "The Shattered Light carried what amounts to an entire heavy industrial factory. Everything from smelters to welding equipment and everything in between." They smile and their gestures take on a tone of irony. "In fact, the ships we have now are in no small part due to the Shattered Light's absence. Without these capabilities, the choice about whether or not to commit to learning the techniques of those who lived here before us was much easier. If the Shattered Light had arrived on schedule we may well still be building ships out of the traditional materials prevalent at the time."`
	"CN-17174" `	"Thank you, Captain. Of course we do not want to keep you waiting, so rest assured that we will contact you if your assistance is needed in the future."`
	"CN-17175" `	Ruach's gestures take on a tone of curiosity. "One thing that you could help us with, if you wish, is resources. Right now we do not have any real need to put all this machinery to work, and as such we do not have the resources to spare to get it fully operational. That being said, if ever you would like a replica of the Shattered Light, we could use this equipment to build one."`
	"CN-17176" `	Her gestures take on an apologetic tone. "It will not be a perfect replica as we will have to use our own systems for most of the internals, and the resource allotment cost will be significantly higher than it would have been back at the Tycho Crater shipyard on Luna... but if you have the resources and interest, the opportunity is there. The shipyard will have more information for you in a day or two." Her gestures trail off with a sign that indicates vast possibilities.`
	"CN-17177" `	"Someday, Captain <first>, much may come from this. But for now, it will be months before we have analyzed everything. Thank you for helping recover a piece of our history, Captain."`
	"CN-17178" `You step out of your airlock to see Prefect Chilia striding towards you. "Captain <first>! I read a report mentioning that you dealt with a trio of 'olofezes out in the Postverta region. Would you be interested in doing some reconnaissance for us? We would like to track down where those came from."`
	"CN-17179" `You step out of your airlock to see Prefect Chilia striding towards you. "Captain <first>! I read a report mentioning that you dealt with a trio of 'olofezes patrolling alone near here. Would you be interested in doing some reconnaissance for us? We would like to track down where those came from."`
	"CN-17180" `	"Yes, I could do that."`
	"CN-17181" `	He signs appreciatively. "We admire your willingness to help." He pulls up a hologram of the Ember Waste, and it shifts to display the systems towards the core. "We are concerned that the Korath may have a new ship that can carry three fighters. Based on the Korath's typical movement patterns, we suspect that - if such a ship exists - it should be somewhere in the nearer Korath systems. We will upload an algorithm to your targeting system to look for ship profiles that have no matches in our database. Please do an outfit scan of whatever ship you find, and report back to me on <destination>."`
	"CN-17182" `	He nods respectfully. "Well, thank you for all that you have done for us. I will see who else is available." With that, he heads off into the starport.`
	"CN-17183" `The algorithm quickly parses the ship signatures present here, and notifies you that one in particular does not match its database: the one identified as the "Ra'puk At 333." This must be the ship that Chilia would like a scan of.`
	"CN-17184" `Chilia is waiting for you when you land. Judging by the hologram floating before him, he appears to already be reviewing the data from your scan. As you approach, he pushes it to the side to focus on you. "This is interesting data," he comments. "What are your thoughts, having seen it first hand?"`
	"CN-17185" `	"You were right in suspecting that this new ship carries an additional fighter. One more fighter might not change much in combat, but if the Korath are building new warships, they may also be building stronger fighters."`
	"CN-17186" `	"An extra fighter bay isn't the only thing this new ship has. It also comes with an extra gun, bigger engines, superior shields and hull, and likely other unseen improvements. Overall it's much more formidable than its predecessor."`
	"CN-17187" `	He listens attentively to your account of visiting Kor Zena'i, nodding thoughtfully at various insights.`
	"CN-17188" `	"Thank you for investigating this, <first>. I will ensure that our engineers get your data immediately, and brief our patrols to be aware of this increased capacity." His gestures have a tone of anticipation and regret.`
	"CN-17189" `	"You are welcome."`
	"CN-17190" `	"Are you expecting something?"`
	"CN-17191" `	Chilia smiles wistfully. "Do you know that feeling, when the whole world is still and the skies are clear, and yet you know in your bones that a storm is coming?" He continues without waiting for a response. "Well, I have had that feeling for decades, growing ever stronger. And now..." He pauses, drawing a deep breath. "Now, it feels like this is the first scent of rain. The first thing I can actually identify as a solid indicator that a storm is brewing."`
	"CN-17192" `	He shakes his head. "But no matter. Planning for the storm is my duty, not yours, and the front is yet to appear.`
	"CN-17193" `	"We have allocated you <payment> for the risks undertaken. Please use it wisely. While it is my duty to anticipate threats to us all, it is your duty to ensure you are prepared to face the winds they may bring." He turns and strides away, quickly vanishing into the tunnels beneath the spaceport.`
	"CN-17194" `You step out of your airlock to find Prefect Chilia waiting for you with a worried look on his face. "Captain <first>, I have a sensitive request for you.`
	"CN-17195" `	"Our scouts are reporting a stranded Korath ship in Vaticanus, a Dathnak A'awoj to be precise. If it were a typical warship obstructing our operations, we would request you track it down and eliminate it, but because ships of this type tend to be home to a large civilian population, destroying or capturing it outright may instigate a reprisal, especially in that sector.`
	"CN-17196" `	"Would you be up for disabling it, so the threat is eliminated while preserving the lives of the innocents on board?" His signs shift from a questioning tone to a confident one. "After you are done we can disarm the ship and fix their jump drive. If they adhere to their typical doctrine they should decide to head back home."`
	"CN-17197" `	"Happy to help those in need, even the Korath."`
	"CN-17198" `	"I have no intentions of risking my neck for some Korath."`
	"CN-17199" `	"I am grateful for your understanding and willingness to help here. Together we can ensure everyone gets home safely."`
	"CN-17200" `	He nods in acknowledgment and his gestures take on a staccato phrasing. "I feared my ask was too much. I understand the sentiment. Perhaps I was naive to think such an outcome was possible."`
	"CN-17201" `You find Chilia with a relieved look on his face when you land.`
	"CN-17202" `	"These assignments are typically handled by our most trusted teams, as taking on the larger Korath vessels is a sensitive matter. Most of their larger ships are home to large groups of Korath civilians, including children. I must admit there were concerns you might not be those children's best chance, but our fleet was occupied elsewhere at the time. I am glad I was not wrong in my assessment of you," he signs with a content smile on his face.`
	"CN-17203" `	"We must be careful not to let ignorance of Korath society result in the unnecessary destruction of similar ships. Now that you have shown you can handle these tasks with the proper finesse, you can expect these to turn up in the task board in the future." Chilia then walks away with a confident pace.`
	"CN-17204" `Your communicator notifies you of a resource allocation of <payment>.`
	"CN-17205" `You have returned, yet the <npc> is still missing.`
	"CN-17206" `As you enter the system, your sensors pick up a lot of debris. Further analysis confirms your worst fears. The <npc> has been destroyed. You frantically spend the next few hours searching for survivors, your hope sinking with every passing minute.`
	"CN-17207" `You land, and with a heavy heart, report that the <npc> was lost with all hands. The Remnant are saddened at the news, but thank you regardless and hand off your resource allocation of <payment>.`
	"CN-17208" `Your communicator notifies you of a resource allocation of <payment>, along with a brief note of thanks.`
	"CN-17209" `Your communicator notifies you of a resource allocation of <payment>, and also a thank you from the captain of the <npc>.`
	"CN-17210" `Upon landing, the captain of the <npc> meets you at your ship to thank you personally for rescuing them from the Graveyard, leaving you with a heartfelt sentence: "May the Embers burn bright for you."`
	"CN-17211" `	Soon after, your communicator notifies you of a resource allocation of <payment>.`
	"CN-17212" `You have returned, yet the <npc> has not.`
	"CN-17213" `Worried that they would never see the Embers again, the captain of the <npc> personally thanks you for bringing them home, even before your communicator notifies you of a resource allocation of <payment>.`
	"CN-17214" `You have returned, but there is still no word from the missing ship.`
	"CN-17215" `Moments after entering the system, you are overwhelmed by an intense sense of emptiness. As you attempt to comprehend this feeling, you begin hearing whispers from behind.`
	"CN-17216" `	(Pull out my sidearm and turn quickly.)`
	"CN-17217" `	You turn around, but nothing is there besides the familiar internals of your ship. The whispers remain behind your head, like an itch that can't be reached. The whispers are in a completely foreign language that you can't even begin to understand. As you keep looking around, you begin hearing more and more murmuring. There feels to be hundreds of distinct voices tugging your mind in every direction at once now, overloading your senses. Just as you think you can't take anymore, everything falls completely silent.`
	"CN-17218" `	"Is there someone there?"`
	"CN-17219" `	"Show yourself!"`
	"CN-17220" `	"Human."`
	"CN-17221" `	An image suddenly flashes in your head as you feel millions of eyes staring at you from beyond the boundaries of space. Looking around again, you see a strange-looking spacecraft a bit off into the distance in front of you facing your direction. The voices continue to surround your mind with only slightly reduced intensity.`
	"CN-17222" `	Numerous voices start up, but rather than becoming louder, they go back and forth in your head, as though they are having a discussion. After a few seconds, they fall silent, then speak a single word in a cacophonous unison.`
	"CN-17223" `	"Precursors."`
	"CN-17224" `	"Precursors of what?"`
	"CN-17225" `	The whispers start to pick up with renewed strength. The swirl of endless vocals assaults your head, each moment more agonizing than the last. Finally, they cease, and you are left in silence.`
	"CN-17226" `	"An End."`
	"CN-17227" `	"An end to what?"`
	"CN-17228" `	"What do you mean by that?"`
	"CN-17229" `	The voices resume, but you sense a newfound dreariness in their tone. You try once again to communicate with the ship, but despite constant whispering in the background, it no longer answers.`
	"CN-17230" `	Taking another look at the vessel, it seems to have some sort of advanced origin. Eerie star-like patterns flow on its surface, and it doesn't visibly have any standard means of propulsion. At the rear end is some type of floating ring of objects that rotate in a peculiar manner.`
	"CN-17231" `	The planets in this system seem to have an abnormal appearance similar to that of the starship, but for some reason even looking at them gives you a headache. Something unusual must have happened here a long time ago.`
	"CN-17232" `It feels as though there is a tremendous weight on your mind while you visit this world. The same sort of purple starlit hues of the alien ship from above can also be found in various strange formations across the land. Unlike the whispers from before, the voices here are painfully unbearable, especially the closer you get to the surface.`
	"CN-17233" `	You can barely hear yourself think.`
	"CN-17234" `											It's enough to drive any living thing mad.`
	"CN-17235" `	The most ominous sensation here is a persistent feeling of your consciousness being pulled at from beneath you.`
	"CN-17236" `	Like something is attempting to drag`
	"CN-17237" `																					your`
	"CN-17238" `																							mind into the planet below.`
	"CN-17239" `	It's best you don't remain here for too long.`
	"CN-17240" `Upon arriving into this system, you notice a strange murkiness curtaining the stars beyond, and your scanners are having trouble making sense of it. The few stellar objects present are eerily blotted out by a vast, nebulous shade. Aside from them, it's as if there is nothing here. Even the shade itself is nothing more than the emptiness of space, and throughout it, no one. Nothing.`
	"CN-17241" `As you continue through this empty space, you come across nothing but diminished stars and planets of silence. However, upon entering this system, you are met with what appears to be a creature of some kind. Strangely, your scanners don't read it as any sort of lifeform, categorizing it only as a mere "collection" of matter. It blends with space itself, as if it were simply a reflection of the darkness beyond.`
	"CN-17242" `Out of nowhere, the mysterious whispers of the Rulei seep into your mind once more. They murmur slowly at first, but grow faster and louder from the direction of the ancient vessel, eventually coalescing into one spoken phrase.`
	"CN-17243" `	"Beware..."`
	"CN-17244" `	"...Umbral Reach..."`
	"CN-17245" `	You feel tremendous weight behind the expression, as if it shook your mind itself. It's as though every emotion has flooded into your head at once - sadness, anger, joy, disgust, even some you can't seem to understand. Before you can respond to them, the voices quickly dissipate, and you're left alone in an uncomfortable silence.`
	"CN-17246" `	The only thing you can think of is the nearby void of desolate systems. Considering your previous experience with the Rulei, they could have somehow psionically connected to the memories of your visit. However, much like those systems, they continue with their unabated silence.`
	"CN-17247" `As you are walking through the spaceport, a man in an expensive suit approaches you. "Pardon me, Captain," he says. "I wonder if you would be willing to talk privately about a very lucrative job opportunity."`
	"CN-17248" `	"Is this something illegal?"`
	"CN-17249" `	"Sure, let's return to my ship and talk there."`
	"CN-17250" `	"Not illegal," he says, "but it could help to uncover a secret with enormous ramifications. A secret that certain people do not want known."`
	"CN-17251" `	"Okay," you say, "let's return to my ship, and I'll hear you out."`
	"CN-17252" `	You lead him back to your ship. "I'm an archaeologist," he explains, "studying the early history of the space era. And in particular, a set of persistent folk tales about contact with alien species. Many of these tales have to do with the region of the galaxy we call the Deep. I need someone to travel to Midgard and retrieve some samples from an ancient site there."`
	"CN-17253" `	"Why can't you travel there yourself?"`
	"CN-17254" `	"What sort of samples? Will this get me in trouble?"`
	"CN-17255" `	"Well, let's just say I've made myself somewhat unpopular in the Deep," he says. "Asking too many questions. If I were seen walking around on Midgard, they would probably ask me to leave immediately."`
	"CN-17256" `	You say, "And, is the work you're asking me to do going to make me equally unpopular?"`
	"CN-17257" `	"Not if you are circumspect," he says. "I need two samples from a certain village. One is simple: wood from a living or recently deceased tree. Any tree will do."`
	"CN-17258" `	He pauses for a minute, then continues. "The other is more... sensitive. There is a historical site on Midgard, an ancient church. Not something they publish in the official tourist guides, mind you. I need a small sample of the wood that the church is built with. A small splinter would suffice."`
	"CN-17259" `	"Sure, if it's in the interest of science, I can do that."`
	"CN-17260" `	"You're asking me to vandalize a historical site?"`
	"CN-17261" `	"I need only the tiniest of samples," he says, "maybe a splinter of wood that is already peeling off, or from a place where the wood is worn and cracked. And what we discover from that sample could be of immense importance."`
	"CN-17262" `	"Sorry, that sounds a bit too shady to me."`
	"CN-17263" `	"Okay, I'm willing to do that."`
	"CN-17264" `	"Thank you," he says. "Trust me, this could give us some very important information. I'll need you to drop me off on Vinci first, to meet with some scientists. We can then meet up back on Vinci once you have the samples."`
	"CN-17265" `You drop off the archaeologist (who still has not told you his name) on <origin>. "Remember," he says, "I only need a tiny splinter. Just make sure it really is from the building and not anything more recent."`
	"CN-17266" `Following the map that the archaeologist gave you, you make your way to a small village in the mountains on <origin>, with two envelopes in your pocket for samples. As you approach the church, you break a dead twig off one of the trees along the path, put it into the first envelope, and pocket it. One sample collected, one more to go.`
	"CN-17267" `	The church itself is unlike any building you have seen before, clearly very ancient, built of roughly hewn wood, old and weathered. Surprisingly, the front doors are open, and you hear music coming from inside.`
	"CN-17268" `	(Walk into the church.)`
	"CN-17269" `	(Take a sample from the outside.)`
	"CN-17270" `	(Give up on this mission and leave, before I get into trouble.)`
	"CN-17271" `	You walk around the outside of the building until you find one corner where the wood has been recently scuffed, and a few hairs of it are hanging loose. You carefully pick the splinters off and put them in the second envelope. Then, you return to your ship. Although you see no one following you, you can't shake the feeling that you are being watched.`
	"CN-17272" `	This church must still be used for services: candles are lit up front, and a man in a white surplice is playing the organ. A few people sit in the pews with their heads bowed. Trying to be as unobtrusive as possible, you join them, and look around at the ornately carved pillars and wood panels. The air in here smells of incense and musty wood.`
	"CN-17273" `	(Take a sample.)`
	"CN-17274" `	(Give up on this mission, and leave.)`
	"CN-17275" `	Pretending to pray, you kneel on the ground, take your pocket knife, and shave the tiniest sliver off the bottom corner of the pew in front of you. It leaves a small white scar in the dark weathered wood of the pew. You pocket the sample, wait a few more minutes, and then leave and walk back to the spaceport. Although you see no one following you, you cannot shake the feeling that you are being watched.`
	"CN-17276" `You return to the lab where you dropped off the anonymous archaeologist. Soon after you arrive, he appears and eagerly collects the two samples, giving you a payment of <payment> for your troubles. "But please," he says, "stick around long enough to learn the results." He hands the two envelopes to a lab technologist, and says, "Here you go, John, take a look and let us know what you find."`
	"CN-17277" `	After the lab tech leaves, he explains, "You see, the ratio of Carbon 12 to Carbon 14 varies from world to world, so accurate dating can only be done if you have a control sample to compare against. Only a handful of archaeological studies have been done in the Deep, and those were sloppy - they used the standard tables of Earth's carbon ratios instead of determining the local concentrations."`
	"CN-17278" `	(Wait and see what the results are.)`
	"CN-17279" `	About thirty minutes later, John reappears, looking somewhat shaken. "Where did you get those samples?" he asks.`
	"CN-17280" `	"Never mind that," says the archaeologist. "What are your results?"`
	"CN-17281" `	"The second sample is infused with some sort of oil or tar," he says. "A varnish. And therefore it is from furniture or a building. A man-made artifact. The control sample has an isotopic ratio different from Earth, so unless you're playing games with me, these samples are not from Earth."`
	"CN-17282" `	"Go on," says the archaeologist.`
	"CN-17283" `	"However," says the lab tech, "again assuming the two samples are from the same planet, the second sample is between fifteen hundred and twenty-five hundred years old. Which means it predates the discovery of the hyperdrive by, at minimum, five centuries. So again I ask you, where did you get these samples?" His voice is raised.`
	"CN-17284" `	"Intriguing, isn't it?" says the archaeologist. "Captain <last>, if you'd like to help us get to the bottom of this, make sure you've got space for us and some equipment, and meet us in the spaceport."`
	"CN-17285" `You find John the lab tech in one of the spaceport bars, along with the archaeologist, who says, "I suppose I should introduce myself. Albert Foster. You may have heard of me." Indeed, you have: he made headlines about a decade ago by being driven out of Quarg space after trying unsuccessfully to collect an alloy sample from their ringworld.`
	"CN-17286" `	"We've purchased some equipment for gravitational field mapping," he says, "in addition to a very sensitive radar array. We're hoping to map the area around the church, see if there are signs of any ancient settlements. Are you willing to help us?"`
	"CN-17287" `	"Sure, I'd love to help solve this mystery."`
	"CN-17288" `	"Sorry, I can't. I'm worried we're going to make people in the Deep angry."`
	"CN-17289" `	"Excellent," says Albert. "We just need to do a flyover of <planet>, and see what our radar turns up."`
	"CN-17290" `You cruise high above the surface of <origin> as John calibrates his instruments. "Sorry it's taking so long," he says, "there's some sort of glitch in the gravitational sensors, messing up my measurements."`
	"CN-17291" `	"What sort of glitch?" asks Albert.`
	"CN-17292" `	"Just a sensor artifact," he says, "some sort of echo. No, wait..." He trails off and starts turning dials on the instrument, then turns very pale.`
	"CN-17293" `	Albert looks over his shoulder at the monitor, but clearly doesn't understand what he's looking at. "What is it?" he asks.`
	"CN-17294" `	"It's not a sensor glitch," says John. "It's an artificial singularity."`
	"CN-17295" `	"Some sort of illegal research?"`
	"CN-17296" `	"A what?"`
	"CN-17297" `	"No, not illegal," says Albert. "No need to make laws against them, for the simple reason that no one knows how to make them. That's alien technology, very advanced."`
	"CN-17298" `	"A miniature black hole," says John. "An alien power source. Far more sophisticated than anything human beings have ever created. That is, unless someone in the Deep has found a way to reverse engineer alien technology."`
	"CN-17299" `	Suddenly, a warning light flashes on your ship's radar. Three ships have taken off from the planet's surface and are headed straight towards you. "Let's get out of here," says Albert. "Head back to <planet>!"`
	"CN-17300" `You breathe a sigh of relief as you land safely in the spaceport on <planet>. "Okay, what was that all about?" you ask.`
	"CN-17301" `	"I honestly don't know," says Albert. "I can tell you what I suspect, though. The history books don't actually say when the Deep was first settled. The first documented expedition to the Deep was in the 24th century, and they found several human colonies already established in the region, claiming to date back to the very dawn of space flight. But I think the first settlers were brought there long before that. Brought there on alien ships."`
	"CN-17302" `	"What aliens? The Quarg?"`
	"CN-17303" `	"Do you think it was the Pug?"`
	"CN-17304" `	"I'm not sure," he says. "But I first became interested in the Deep while researching the Alpha Wars. I'm sure you know the history, how humanity was nearly enslaved by psychopathic 'super' humans that we ourselves had created by dabbling in genetic engineering. At that time, the Deep made a sudden, improbable technological leap that allowed them to construct weapons and ships far more powerful than what the Alphas had, and the war against them was won."`
	"CN-17305" `	"There are popular folk tales in the Deep about 'elves,'" says Albert. "Thin, pale, graceful creatures, with blue blood."`
	"CN-17306" `	John frowns. "Hemocyanic blood. Not the Quarg, then. Their lungs are odd, but their blood uses hemoglobin for oxygen transport, just like ours."`
	"CN-17307" `	Albert and John give confused looks at each other for a second before Albert says, "The aliens that invaded human space?"`
	"CN-17308" `	John appears to think hard on the subject before saying, "That's certainly an interesting connection. I don't know how we didn't think of it. From the descriptions that I've heard about them, they almost exactly match the folk tales in the Deep about 'elves.'"`
	"CN-17309" `	"Thin, pale, and blue blooded, yes? Well, I think you may have figured something out, Captain <last>," replies Albert.`
	"CN-17310" `	"That's great, but what does it mean for us?"`
	"CN-17311" `	"From what I understand, they've been around for a while, and have mentioned past interference in the Deep."`
	"CN-17312" `	"Well then, if the Pug have admitted to 'interfering' with the Deep in the past then we have good reason to believe they fit into our current knowledge of the timeline here," Albert replies. "Unfortunately we can't just ask the Pug exactly what they've done or when they did it, but simply knowing of their presence here aids in our research."`
	"CN-17313" `	"Nothing immediately," says John, "but nevertheless, it is at least useful to know the timeline of events here."`
	"CN-17314" `	"Indeed," replies Albert, "simply knowing of their presence here aids in our research."`
	"CN-17315" `	Albert continues, "What I think is that an unknown alien species has been involved in events in the Deep since the beginning, and is perhaps still involved there today. I think this is known to at least some of the Deep's inhabitants."`
	"CN-17316" `	"How can we find out more information?"`
	"CN-17317" `	"Well," he says, "unfortunately, Captain, they're going to be watching you. I'll have to seek out someone else for the next stages of my research. But I will keep you notified if I discover anything further."`
	"CN-17318" `	It is an unsatisfactory conclusion to your work, with so many questions unanswered. But to make up for that, Albert gives you <payment> as payment for your services. "You will hear from me again," he promises.`
	"CN-17319" `As your ship drifts through the cloud of dust that surrounds Ildaria, it occurs to you that this must be the "cloudy star out along the Rim" that Ulrich from There Might Be Riots told you about. Remembering his story, you shut your eyes and attempt to meditate. But instead, you just fall asleep.`
	"CN-17320" `You dream that you leave this star system and return to Zug, but when you land there everything is different: the cities you remember are gone, and in their place are other cities with strange architecture, populated by gargantuan dragon-like creatures.`
	"CN-17321" `	Time speeds up, and you watch as the dragon cities grow and spread out. You see one city buried under a massive lava flow, starships buzzing around it like a cloud of flies to carry people and goods to safety. Other cities are destroyed by war, and then abruptly the dragon-people are all gone and their cities lie vacant. Buildings crumble, and the forests reclaim the land.`
	"CN-17322" `	Then you wake up and find yourself back in your ship, in the Ildaria system. Weird.`
	"CN-17323" `On a whim, as you're landing on Zug you pull up a geological map of the planet and find that the geography you dreamt of while drifting in the Ildaria system was surprisingly close to the real thing. There's even a massive basalt outcropping right where you saw a lava flow burying a city. There's no way your ship's sensors can tell what's underneath it, though.`
	"CN-17324" `As your ship settles down on <origin>, you recall the visions of an alien civilization you experienced while in Ildaria, and how the terrain you saw resembled the landscape of Zug. Perhaps Albert Foster can help you investigate further.`
	"CN-17325" `This planet is where the archaeologist Albert Foster has his lab, the one who sent you on a mission to collect samples from a planet in the Deep. Would you like to try to convince him to look for signs of an ancient alien civilization in the Rim systems?`
	"CN-17326" `	Foster seems glad to see you. "It's been a while, <first>. Something catch your eye recently?"`
	"CN-17327" `	Foster is slightly surprised by your arrival. "My apologies, but I haven't made any progress in the Deep since we last talked. Unless you have something else for me?"`
	"CN-17328" `	You do your best to pique his interest without saying anything that will make him think you're crazy, but he's clearly not buying it. "I'm sorry," he says, "but I'm not mounting an expedition just because you have a 'hunch.' So unless you're willing to tell me the source of your information, I'm not interested." He turns his attention back to the data pad that he was reading before you walked into his office.`
	"CN-17329" `	"I had this dream about dragon-people on Zug."`
	"CN-17330" `	"I think a telepathic space alien spoke to me."`
	"CN-17331" `	"Then I'd rather not help you," he says, without looking up from the data pad.`
	"CN-17332" `	"You had a dream," he says. "Sorry, no. Oneirological archaeology is notoriously unreliable." From his tone of voice, you think he's being sarcastic.`
	"CN-17333" `	You expect him to laugh at you, but instead he's so shocked that he drops the data pad he's holding. "An Archon?" he says. "How the hell did you get tangled up with one of those?" You tell him the story, and he listens intently.`
	"CN-17334" `	"It's feasible," he says. "We've heard rumors from the Quarg that an alien civilization used to exist in the Rim, a hundred thousand years ago. No signs of it, of course - any artifacts they left behind have been destroyed by the elements, or perhaps intentionally removed. But if a city were encased in lava, that could preserve signs of it even over such a long time frame."`
	"CN-17335" `	Foster makes a few phone calls to cancel his upcoming plans, and then shows up at your ship with a large collection of geological surveying tools. "Let's go check it out," he says.`
	"CN-17336" `You land your ship on the lava flow, and Albert Foster fires up his surveying equipment. "This will show me a density profile of different layers of rock beneath us," he says. As he gradually dials the instrument down to deeper and deeper layers, a few irregular white spots appear on the screen.`
	"CN-17337" `	"What are those?"`
	"CN-17338" `	(Be quiet and let him focus.)`
	"CN-17339" `	"Air pockets," he says, "some of them filled in with ground water. Nothing out of the ordinary."`
	"CN-17340" `	When the scan reaches about thirty meters below the surface, suddenly the view changes...`
	"CN-17341" `	"Great burning suns!" says Foster. "There is something down there! Roads in a triangular grid. That ain't no human city." You both stare at the monitor for a minute, then Foster says, "I'm going to need to pull some permits. Meet me in the spaceport in an hour if you're willing to help pick up some of the other stuff we'll need."`
	"CN-17342" `When you meet up with Foster, he tells you, "This is going to be tricky. We're going to have to dig through a twenty meter thick slab of solid basalt to get at those ruins. We have to work fast, or my competitors will catch wind of what we're doing and beat us to the punch. But we have to work delicately, too, or we'll damage what's underneath. Blasting won't work. I think some of the Syndicate's strip mining equipment could do the job, though. Would you be able to pick up maybe twenty or thirty tons of heavy machinery from <planet>?"`
	"CN-17343" `	"Sorry, I don't have time to help out anymore."`
	"CN-17344" `	He seems incredulous. "No time to participate in what could be one of the biggest discoveries of the last hundred years? You'll be well paid for your services too, if that's what's holding you back."`
	"CN-17345" `	"Okay, I'll pick up your equipment from <planet>."`
	"CN-17346" `When you arrive on <origin>, the excavation machines requested by Albert Foster are already waiting for you at the spaceport. They are some of the largest terrestrial vehicles you have ever seen: a truck with enormous toothed grinding wheels for cutting through stone, and a front-end loader for carrying the loose stone away. You are barely able to fit them through the entrance of your cargo bay.`
	"CN-17347" `You drop off the excavation machines at the dig site on Zug, and receive your payment of three hundred thousand credits. Foster has already marked out lines of where he wants to dig and has completed a much more detailed geological scan. "We'll be starting with a narrow trench," he tells you, "and expanding out from there. It'll need to be wide enough to include a ramp for the vehicles, of course, so we'll still need to move a lot of rock. And when we get within the last five meters or so, I'm worried that the vibration from the grinders may be too destructive. So, I need some laser excavation equipment from <planet>, next."`
	"CN-17348" `	You agree to fetch the equipment, and he begins directing the work crews to get the digging started.`
	"CN-17349" `Once again, the equipment that Foster needs is waiting for you when you land. It's a truck carrying a power generator and an articulated arm with a laser cannon mounted on the end. You can't help imagining what would happen if it malfunctioned and began firing while inside your cargo bay, but the engineer who delivers it assures you that it has many redundant safeties in place.`
	"CN-17350" `	Also waiting for you is an encrypted message from Foster: "Hi there, <first>. I've been told that one of my competitors, Sibyl Greythatch, has been asking around trying to figure out where my dig site is. She's an antiquities thief - robs archaeological sites and sells the artifacts on the black market. I think my equipment purchase on <origin> may have caught her attention. If so, her ship, the Oxyrhynchus, will be following you. Don't return to the dig site until you're certain you've shaken her."`
	"CN-17351" `As you are approaching Zug, you notice on your radar that the ship Foster warned you about has been following you: the Oxyrhynchus. You land in the main spaceport to avoid leading her to the dig site. You will need to shake her pursuit before delivering the equipment.`
	"CN-17352" `When you return to the dig, Foster's trench is already almost ten meters deep. You tell him that you saw the Oxyrhynchus on your scanners, but you were able to evade it. "Good job," he says. "Now, we need a xenobiologist who can help us make sense of what we find. A friend of mine, Amelia Lee, has been living on the Quarg ringworld for the last decade or so, and she agreed to come visit the dig, and also to see what the Quarg can tell us about this old alien civilization. Also, here's your pay for transporting the laser cutter." He hands you another three hundred thousand credits.`
	"CN-17353" `	You agree to pick her up, and he returns to supervising the excavation.`
	"CN-17354" `Amelia Lee meets you at the spaceport, along with a Quarg who is a bit shorter than normal, but still tall enough to tower over you. "Captain <last>?" she says. "Let me introduce my friend Yarthis Amorthee Dek-Farsook Nai," she says. "Yarthis will be accompanying us to the site."`
	"CN-17355" `	"No problem. Welcome aboard!"`
	"CN-17356" `	"Do we really need to get the Quarg involved directly in this?"`
	"CN-17357" `	To your human eyes, unused to reading their expressions, the Quarg almost always seem grim and serious. But Yarthis seems particularly grave as it says, "You are digging in a graveyard, Captain. Someone must be present to see that the dead are given their due respect."`
	"CN-17358" `	As both of them board your ship, Amelia chats enthusiastically with you. "One ringworld can sustain a population in excess of a trillion," she says, "so the Quarg need long names in order to unambiguously identify themselves." She goes on to ask questions about the progress of the dig, using so much technical jargon that at times it almost sounds like she is speaking the Quarg language rather than your own. Clearly she is very knowledgeable about the study of alien societies, and you are surprised to learn that she was actually born in Hai space, as the granddaughter of some of the first humans who settled there.`
	"CN-17359" `Foster greets Amelia enthusiastically when you land, but seems less enthusiastic about having Yarthis here as well. The dig has nearly reached the target depth, and at the deepest part of the trench they are now slicing out blocks of stone with the laser and hoisting them out of the pit rather than just grinding through the rock. "Thanks again, Captain," he says, as he hands you a chip worth two hundred thousand credits.`
	"CN-17360" `	As Foster is showing the three of you around the dig, one of the workers runs up. "Mister Foster," he says, "there's a ton of traffic on the emergency militia channel. I think the planet is under attack."`
	"CN-17361" `	Foster swears and looks up at the sky as if expecting pirates to swoop down and steal his precious artifacts at any moment. "Captain <last>," he says, "We have to keep those pirates away from the dig at all costs, or they could destroy priceless information. Can you assist in defending the planet?"`
	"CN-17362" `	"My ship is not a warship."`
	"CN-17363" `	"Then just get up there and lead them around in circles until reinforcements arrive," he says. "I don't care how you do it, just keep whoever is up there occupied."`
	"CN-17364" `	As you run for your ship, you see Yarthis pull out some sort of communication device and speak into it. Perhaps the Quarg will be joining in this fight as well...`
	"CN-17365" `You try to land near the dig, but pirate ships are still circling nearby. Better deal with them before returning to check in on Foster.`
	"CN-17366" `A plume of smoke is rising from the dig site. Fearing the worst, you land and find out that a missile fired by one of the pirates destroyed one of the huts where the workers were living, but fortunately no one was inside it at the time. Foster is shaken but still committed to finishing the work. "It will be months before we've excavated enough to be able to publish any findings," he says, "but Yarthis has told me that the Quarg will be stationing a Wardragon here for the remainder of the project, to prevent any further foul play." Foster gives you one last payment: four hundred thousand credits for your help driving off the pirates. "And I'll be sure to give you credit for your help when the news goes public," he says.`
	"CN-17367" `When you give your name to the spaceport traffic controller, he says, "Wait, you're Captain <first> <last>? You're all over the news right now!"`
	"CN-17368" `	You land and find that Albert Foster has published an initial report on the dig on Zug. The ruins under the lava flow did indeed turn out to be an alien city. The houses are built on a gargantuan scale, with most of the doorways at least ten meters tall. What's more, some of the buildings have no exterior doors on the street level, just doors facing balconies or inner courtyards, which supports the theory that the inhabitants were capable of flight. Most of the artifacts left behind are just everyday items, and in fact the technology seems less advanced than present human society, but scientists are studying the artifacts eagerly to glean hints about how these aliens lived.`
	"CN-17369" `	The Quarg, who at other times seem quite willing to share their knowledge with human beings, are being surprisingly reticent with information about this lost civilization. Aside from telling Foster that the aliens were known as the Sheragi, their only comments have been vague warnings that if human beings persist in developing weapons of war, they will end up like the Sheragi. From this, Foster has surmised that the alien civilization was most likely destroyed by a civil war, not by natural disaster or an attack by another species.`
	"CN-17370" `	It may not yield any great advances in human technology, but the dig will be providing clues to the history of the galaxy for years to come, and you can be proud to have played a part in that.`
	"CN-17371" `You receive an encoded message from Albert Foster, the archaeologist who you helped to uncover the mysterious Sheragi ruins on Zug. He seems to be very excited.`
	"CN-17372" `	"<first>! Been a while, hasn't it? Remember the Sheragi dig site? We've just found something incredible here. Please, come visit me on Zug. I don't think I can trust anyone else with this."`
	"CN-17373" `You land at the dig site and notice that Albert was already waiting for you, watching your descent. He greets you as soon as the ship doors open.`
	"CN-17374" `	"Hello, <first>! Would you like to go on a little tour of the museum?"`
	"CN-17375" `	"Museum? What museum?"`
	"CN-17376" `	"Sure, I'm eager to see what you discovered."`
	"CN-17377" `	"Just tell me what's so important."`
	"CN-17378" `	"Didn't you know? There is a museum open within the dig site now, full of interesting artifacts. We turned it into quite the tourist trap. Here, follow me and I'll show you."`
	"CN-17379" `	You take the chance to catch up as he leads you into the ancient city's ruins, talking about the "minor" discoveries he has made so far, though he insists on keeping the reason he brought you here a surprise. He leads you to one of the Sheragi buildings that have been uncovered, skipping a long queue lined before the entrance to find that the room has been filled with various artifacts in display cases.`
	"CN-17380" `	It's strange to see so many technological devices as old as some of the prehistoric tools from ancient Earth, most of them so deteriorated you wouldn't even be able to imagine what they were used for if it wasn't for the descriptions next to their display cases. One of the most intact relics is a small metal statue of an individual Sheragi in flight like the dragons of Skymoot, possibly a trophy for some event, or perhaps a mere sculpture of a popular character of their time. It's impossible to know now, but one thing is certain: it's the most faithful representation available of what they looked like. The figure matches almost perfectly the ones you saw in your dream, back in Ildaria. As you turn your head to look at how tall the doors of this house are, then back at the statue again, you realize how big they must have been. It's hard to imagine the size their spaceships must have been to even hope to fit a creature this large.`
	"CN-17381" `	"This is an impressive collection."`
	"CN-17382" `	"It is! But it's not even the main attraction for you today. Follow me."`
	"CN-17383" `	After the tour is over, he leads you to another building in an area that is off-limits to the general public.`
	"CN-17384" `	"Straight to the point? Fair enough, I'm eager as well, but do come visit the museum some time in the future. There are so many interesting objects."`
	"CN-17385" `	You take the chance to catch up as he leads you into the ancient city's ruins, talking about the "minor" discoveries he made so far, such as statues of Sheragi that depict what they once looked like. "We would perhaps never know their appearance had we not found something like it. But these small discoveries are not the main attraction for you today," Albert says with a wide smile. He leads you into one of the uncovered Sheragi buildings, in an area that is off-limits to the public.`
	"CN-17386" `	"Here it is!"`
	"CN-17387" `	There is a tunnel going deep underground inside the room, but Albert sets his attention on a large safe instead. As he opens it up, he begins to explain the situation.`
	"CN-17388" `	"So, from what we know, the Sheragi died off in a war of catastrophic proportions. One of our interns suggested we survey deeper underground, to check for military facilities or bunkers, even though our previous scans didn't show anything interesting, so we allowed her to play around with the ground-penetrating radar. And wouldn't you believe it, there were some angled pieces of metal under the dirt. Clearly man-made. Well... Sheragi-made, in this case. So we dug deeper, and found what we can only assume to have been a bunker, showing signs of having been hit by a powerful kinetic weapon. Despite the damage, we could still salvage some artifacts from the debris. Particularly, this thing."`
	"CN-17389" `	Albert opens the safe and shows you a weathered, red metal cube, around a quarter of a meter on each side. He struggles with the weight, but manages to set it down on the floor.`
	"CN-17390" `	"This appears to be a data storage device of some sort. It was connected to what we think were once computers, but nothing else was salvageable after spending thousands of years under the wet soil. Based on how sturdy this thing is, it's plausible that some of the data could have survived, like a time capsule.`
	"CN-17391" `	"I have a contact back on Vinci who could probably figure this out, and this is where you come in. You remember John, right? I can't leave the dig site, but I also don't have anyone else I could trust to carry such a valuable artifact. Will you take it there for me?"`
	"CN-17392" `	"Sure, I'll take the cube to him."`
	"CN-17393" `	"Who's John again?"`
	"CN-17394" `	"I'm sorry, but that sounds sketchier than all the other jobs I did for you. The Quarg were very clear in saying that some things are not meant to be found."`
	"CN-17395" `	"Oh, you don't remember him? He's the scientist who worked with us when we were investigating the church on Midgard. He has all the fancy equipment needed to look into this cube."`
	"CN-17396" `	"What?" He seems incredulous. "After going this far, you're abandoning me? Knowledge by itself isn't dangerous. This cube could be the key to lost eons of history, to secrets of the Sheragi we couldn't even dream of!"`
	"CN-17397" `	"All right, I'll take it to him."`
	"CN-17398" `	"Sorry, but I'm not crossing that line."`
	"CN-17399" `	"Splendid!"`
	"CN-17400" `	You put the cube in an inconspicuous backpack and carry it back to your ship. Albert gives you an address where you'll deliver the cube, mentions that you will be paid after transporting it, and wishes you good luck on your travel.`
	"CN-17401" `You arrive on Vinci and carry the cube to the address Foster gave you. You find that John has been waiting for you. "So, Foster is up to no good again, huh?" He laughs as he lets you into his lab.`
	"CN-17402" `	"It doesn't seem likely that we'll get in trouble this time."`
	"CN-17403" `	"I'm slightly concerned myself, but I'm sure he knows what he's doing."`
	"CN-17404" `	You set the backpack with the cube down on a table and open it up.`
	"CN-17405" `	"Well, he's paying me to help with this, so no problem with me. It's not like everyone gets to see the exotic things he finds first hand. I mean, an artificial singularity..." he trails off, reminiscing about the adventure the three of you had in the Deep.`
	"CN-17406" `	John proceeds to examine the cube. He's strong enough to pick it up with no problems and look at it from different angles, trying to find some port to connect to. He finds one, but it's so deteriorated that any attempts to use it would be fruitless. He places the cube inside a machine to take a deeper scan of the object, and watches it silently working, staring patiently at the screen.`
	"CN-17407" `	"Yes, this seems to be a data storage device of some sort... it's made to be sturdy, like a black box, so it's plausible that we could recover some data from it. This is going to take a very long time, though."`
	"CN-17408" `	"How long?" you ask.`
	"CN-17409" `	"A couple months, probably. It depends on how alien this thing is, and if it's encrypted or not, but I should at least figure out if there is any recoverable data in here by then."`
	"CN-17410" `	John says he'll drop you a message once his results come out, and you part ways and return to your ship.`
	"CN-17411" `You receive an urgent call from John, who has been working on the mysterious Sheragi black box for about a month now.`
	"CN-17412" `	"Captain <last>! I have some bad news and some worse news. Which one do you want to hear first?"`
	"CN-17413" `	"The bad news."`
	"CN-17414" `	"The worse news."`
	"CN-17415" `	"The bad news is that this is a lot more complicated than I thought. I found out that the data in the box has survived, and can still be recovered after all this time, but it will need some specialized hardware and knowledge that we don't have yet."`
	"CN-17416" `	"And the worse news?" you ask.`
	"CN-17417" `	"Well... some people invaded my lab during the night and stole a lot of the things I was working on. Thankfully my insurance covers most of it, and I still have most of my heavy expensive equipment, but the box... it's gone."`
	"CN-17418" `	"Well... some people invaded my lab during the night, and stole a lot of the things I was working on. Thankfully my insurance covers most of it, and I still have most of my heavy expensive equipment, but the box... it's gone."`
	"CN-17419" `	"And the bad news?" you ask.`
	"CN-17420" `	"The less bad news is that this is a lot more complicated than I thought. I found out that the data in the box has survived, and can still be recovered after all this time, but it will need some specialized hardware and knowledge that we don't have yet."`
	"CN-17421" `	Your heart sinks. "What do we do now? Do you have any idea where to find the box? Did you contact law enforcement?"`
	"CN-17422" `	"I did what I could, but if this was mandated as I suspect, the police aren't going to help, and the box is probably off-world by now. However... if you have some cash on hand, and you're willing to go the extra mile to recover the box, there might be a way."`
	"CN-17423" `	"What? No, of course not! Do you think I would steal my own work? Let me explain.`
	"CN-17424" `	"Albert's methods are... nonstandard, to say the least, and we've dealt with a certain individual once. An information dealer who lives on Stormhold. Sketchy person, seems to have informants nearly everywhere and knows about everything. The individual in question is known as Mammon. If you want to find the box, dealing with Mammon is probably your best bet."`
	"CN-17425" `	"Thank you, I'll see if I can find this Mammon person."`
	"CN-17426" `	"I'm sorry, but I think nothing good can come out of this. Better to forget about the cube."`
	"CN-17427" `	"Knowing their methods, they'll likely find you first. But don't be alarmed, they're not... evil, per se. Just be careful, alright?"`
	"CN-17428" `Despite the obvious hostility the locals display towards you, you've safely entered Stormhold's atmosphere. You're still halfway through the descent when a robotic, modulated voice hails you.`
	"CN-17429" `	"I heard you were looking for me, <first> <last>," the person on the other end says.`
	"CN-17430" `	"Who are you? How do you know my name?"`
	"CN-17431" `	"You did? How?"`
	"CN-17432" `	"In my line of business, I have to know everything. That includes the identities of any potential clients, such as yourself. How else would you hope to find me?`
	"CN-17433" `	The mysterious person laughs.`
	"CN-17434" `	"It looks like I know you more than you know yourself. I am who you're looking for, of course.`
	"CN-17435" `	"Mammon, information vendor. At your service," the voice states ominously. "Come meet me in person to discuss the specifics of what you're looking for." The connection cuts and you receive coordinates to land in a seemingly random location that appears to be in the middle of the sea.`
	"CN-17436" `	You arrive at the coordinates in the middle of nowhere under stormy conditions. You begin to question whether you received the correct coordinates until a massive submarine emerges from the waves. It is a gargantuan vessel, and as lights guide you to land on its deck, you notice that despite the size of your ship, it comfortably fits on the deck, where it is automatically secured in place by magnetic locks. Armed men in business suits surround your ship, and once you disembark, two of them guide you inside. You're led into a dimly lit room with a holographic map of the galaxy on the ceiling and a desk, behind which a hooded figure sits.`
	"CN-17437" `	"There we are, away from prying eyes. Please, take a seat," they say. Their voice has a strange tone with no distinguishable gender, with a sibilating, guttural accent, and it's not until you sit down that you notice a reptilian snout poking out of the hood. You don't know whether this is natural or an extreme body modification.`
	"CN-17438" `	"Are you a..."`
	"CN-17439" `	They cut you off, grinning. "Forget it. You'd need to steal whole planets for that information."`
	"CN-17440" `	"Let's get to what matters. You want to find that alien artifact, yes?" You nod in response. "I have the information you need. Finding lost objects is the most trivial of my services, but as with everything, it has a price.`
	"CN-17441" `	"Ten million credits," they say. "Non-negotiable. And don't try anything funny."`
	"CN-17442" `	"What? I don't have that much money!"`
	"CN-17443" `	"That's expensive. If it's such a trivial service, can't I have a discount?"`
	"CN-17444" `You come back to Stormhold and receive new coordinates to meet with Mammon. Would you like to visit them?`
	"CN-17445" `	You follow the new coordinates, arriving again in a random place in the sea, again under stormy conditions, which seems to be the norm on this planet. The submarine emerges, you land, and follow the men to Mammon's room once again.`
	"CN-17446" `	"Welcome back," they say.`
	"CN-17447" `	"I hope you are ready to make your payment."`
	"CN-17448" `	"You should know that I don't have that much money to spare."`
	"CN-17449" `	"Are you ready to give me a discount?"`
	"CN-17450" `	"How about you tell me what I want and I don't blow up your ship and your pirate friends?"`
	"CN-17451" `	"I need to think about this. Give me some time."`
	"CN-17452" `	"That's a lot of money just for information. Can you make it cheaper?"`
	"CN-17453" `	"Here's the money."`
	"CN-17454" `	"I know you don't. I can arrange for the payment to be made in different ways. Organ donation, prostitution, volunteering as a test subject... We'll need an appraisal first, though."`
	"CN-17455" `	You politely decline.`
	"CN-17456" `	"Come back to me when you have it, then, and I shall provide you with the information. We have all the time in the universe. Until you die, or someone decides to destroy the cube, that is."`
	"CN-17457" `	"Come back when you're ready, then. We have all the time in the universe. Until you die, or someone decides to destroy the cube, that is. It's all up to you."`
	"CN-17458" `	They gesture, and the men promptly and diligently escort you back out to your ship.`
	"CN-17459" `	Mammon doesn't look pleased.`
	"CN-17460" `	"What part of non-negotiable did you not understand? You're pushing your luck, Captain <last>. I didn't expect you to be such a petty money pincher."`
	"CN-17461" `	Mammon just smiles, displaying sharp teeth and licking them with a forked tongue, more entertained than intimidated.`
	"CN-17462" `	"Really? You think you can intimidate me? It's your funeral, human. If you were smart, you would know that my power far exceeds yours, especially in my own home. You know I can't let you leave here alive now. It would set a bad precedent for me. Safety is my top priority."`
	"CN-17463" `	You look around, and the men in suits are pointing guns at you. Alien guns. Before you can react, Mammon shoots you from under the table, fatally injuring your abdomen. Your half conscious body is dragged out of the submarine, and your ship being shredded to pieces by alien weapons is the last thing you see.`
	"CN-17464" `	You slide the credit chips to Mammon, but they decline it, grinning with their sharp teeth.`
	"CN-17465" `	"Don't worry about paying right now. I only needed you to agree to the deal. I will withdraw the credits in the future, when I desire.`
	"CN-17466" `	"Now that we're done with that, the artifact you're looking for has been taken by some mercenaries. It seems to me that your friend messed with the wrong people, but I digress. That is not the information you paid for."`
	"CN-17467" `	Mammon lifts their hands to the holographic map of the galaxy in the ceiling. It zooms in, filling up the entire room with stars. In front of you, you recognize the border between the Deep and the Dirt Belt.`
	"CN-17468" `	"They have kept the artifact for themselves to sell on the black market, and their base of operations is right... here. Algieba."`
	"CN-17469" `	The hologram zooms further in on Watcher, one of the system's moons, and continues until it finally stops over a large forest.`
	"CN-17470" `	"You will find them on this uninhabited moon. They are hiding out in this forest, and the artifact is with them. The exact coordinates will be forwarded to your ship. Expect hostilities."`
	"CN-17471" `	You thank Mammon for the service and get up to leave.`
	"CN-17472" `	"See you, Captain <last>. Remember I always do."`
	"CN-17473" `You receive a message informing you of a very large transaction: 10 million credits. With it, a message containing only the image of a reptilian eye logo. It seems Mammon's crew have withdrawn the money you agreed to pay for the information about the Sheragi black box.`
	"CN-17474" `You arrive at the uninhabited moon of Watcher and scout the area around the coordinates Mammon sent you. It's relatively easy to find some smoke rising from a campfire in a clearing, but as you approach to investigate, you're surprised by several large ships taking off to greet you, ditching the green tarps used to hide among the trees. It looks like they really don't want you here.`
	"CN-17475" `You attempt to evade the mercenary ships and make a quick assault on their encampment, but the ships follow you through the atmosphere, and ground personnel start shooting at you. Bombing it on a pass means you risk destroying the cube. You have no choice but to go back to space and eliminate the mercenary fleet.`
	"CN-17476" `You come in for a landing, and the few mercenaries that stayed on the ground march towards your ship carrying a makeshift white flag. Dozens of tough-looking men and women approach in uniform but unarmed. They remain calm and organized. These aren't ordinary criminals, it seems.`
	"CN-17477" `	"We know when we've lost," one of them yells to your ship on a megaphone. "What is it that you want?"`
	"CN-17478" `	You land and cautiously open the hatch to talk with them.`
	"CN-17479" `	"Who do you work for? Where is the cube you stole?" you ask.`
	"CN-17480" `	"So that old thing was yours?" one woman up front says. "I knew that mission was sketchy... We're mercenaries. We were employed by fancy-looking people who paid us really well to steal it, but when we returned with it, they just scanned it and told us to dispose of it. Said that a digital copy is fine, and the trouble should be enough retribution. We don't know who they were, we don't ask questions. That might be about to change now.`
	"CN-17481" `	"If you want the cube, you can have it if you spare us. It's not worth our lives."`
	"CN-17482" `	(Spare them.)`
	"CN-17483" `	(Open fire.)`
	"CN-17484" `	Feeling distrustful, you immediately close the hatch and get back into your ship while they scatter.`
	"CN-17485" `	Disregarding their surrender, you turn your ship towards them and open fire on the small army. Using your ship-mounted guns against ground personnel is honestly excessive, and they didn't stand a chance. There is now a smoldering clearing around the place where they once stood, and a forest fire is beginning to spread.`
	"CN-17486" `	You enter the camp, shooting any mercenaries that remained hidden, and pillage their tents. You find hundreds of thousands of credits, in chips and valuables, and eventually, you find the cube as well. With that in hand, you go back to your ship, ready to take it back to John.`
	"CN-17487" `	"Deal. Bring it to me," you say.`
	"CN-17488" `	While one of them goes to fetch it, you wait in an uncomfortable silence, watching their every move while they watch yours. Eventually the young man who left to get the cube comes back and gives it to you. You examine it, confirming it is the artifact you were looking for.`
	"CN-17489" `	"You have it, now go away. We won't get in your way again," the woman who spoke before says, and the other mercenaries begin to disband, going back to their tents.`
	"CN-17490" `	With the cube in your arms, you have no more reason to stay here. You go back to your ship, ready to take it back to John.`
	"CN-17491" `Carrying the mysterious box again, you make your way to John's lab. He lets you in, and you tell him about what you just went through.`
	"CN-17492" `	"So, retribution, huh? You think it was the officials from the Deep that got angry at us last time? Or maybe Foster's competitors for that dig site? I should have seen that coming."`
	"CN-17493" `	"Possibly," you say. "I can't imagine any other reason."`
	"CN-17494" `	"At least you got it back. But I don't know if it would be wise to continue to work on it here, and I can't just leave the planet for a couple months with no consequences. I don't even have a clue on how to read that data yet."`
	"CN-17495" `	"And what, do you happen to have another shady contact who can help?" you ask.`
	"CN-17496" `	"Unfortunately not. And now we seem to be running against time. If only the Quarg would be willing to work with us and give us the information we need to crack this box..."`
	"CN-17497" `	As soon as you hear that phrase, it suddenly hits you. You've met the Hai up north, and you heard from the Unfettered that they've met the Sheragi many millennia ago. Perhaps the Hai could be able to help.`
	"CN-17498" `	"I think I know what to do. You're not the only person with contacts in strange places."`
	"CN-17499" `	You pick up your things, placing the cube back inside the backpack.`
	"CN-17500" `	"Well, I wish I could study it longer, but if you have a lead, it's worth pursuing. I trust you'll return the cube to either myself or Albert once you're done with it. Good luck, Captain. Don't get in too much trouble."`
	"CN-17501" `You ask around the spaceport until you manage to find a Hai tourist guide. You ask him if there's any place where you could find more information about the Sheragi.`
	"CN-17502" `	"A human knows about them? I'm surprised. This is ancient history. If there's any place where you can find out more about them, it's the Museum of Galactic History on <planet>."`
	"CN-17503" `	You thank the guide and return to your ship, plotting a course to the <system> system.`
	"CN-17504" `Arriving on Mirrorlake, you ask around for a while, and eventually, someone directs you to the Museum of Galactic History: a huge, and very important place, but surprisingly not a very popular tourist spot. Most Hai aren't very fond of looking at the past, and most humans have no idea this place exists. The museum staff is surprised to see a human face, and as you wander you feel like you're drawing more attention from the locals than the exhibits themselves.`
	"CN-17505" `	The place has a very unusual architecture vaguely resembling Earth's Ancient Greece, but clearly not based on any human design. Touches of metal, concrete, glass, and plastic add a modern aspect to its design. Exhibit rooms branch off a long corridor that makes up the majority of the building. The rooms are arranged such that history proceeds backwards as you walk through the museum, with recent events at the front and the earliest at the back.`
	"CN-17506" `	One room you enter is dominated by a mural depicting the Hai's history of contact with humanity. What jumps out to you is that the first humans in the mural are shown with green skin. The only green skinned humans you know of are the Alphas. The mural seems to show the Alphas stealing something from the Hai, followed by a series of battles, at the end of which the Alphas are shown retreating into the wormhole. Ships then come back through the wormhole, only this time carrying normal humans. The Hai in the mural appear apprehensive at first, but it is clear that a friendship was quickly established.`
	"CN-17507" `	It is surprising and unfortunate to learn that the first contact the Hai ever had with humanity was with the Alphas.`
	"CN-17508" `	One room you enter is dominated by a mural depicting the Hai's history of contact with humanity. It begins with the Alphas, just as Ambassador Hiyamaharu told you about. The mural seems to show the Alphas stealing something from the Hai, followed by a series of battles, at the end of which the Alphas are shown retreating into the wormhole. Ships then come back through the wormhole, only this time carrying normal humans. The Hai in the mural appear apprehensive at first, but it is clear that a friendship was quickly established.`
	"CN-17509" `	As you continue to wander further down the aisle, you find rooms dedicated to the Korath raids, their civil war, and the first contact with them, along with a very poetic recounting of the origins of the Unfettered. Going deeper, you find even more sections: a long one detailing Hai culture on several different worlds and how they shifted with time, another on the fall of the Hai government that once inhabited part of what is now human space and the decision to pull back into a small territory, one on the completion of the Quarg ringworld, one for Hai trade and military culture during their imperial phase, and a very grim-looking room on the Hai Civil Wars. Finally, after a very long walk, you arrive at a room nearly at the end of the aisle, recounting the history of the Sheragi.`
	"CN-17510" `	(Continue into the Sheragi room.)`
	"CN-17511" `	What you see here is much richer than what Albert Foster's little museum could ever hope to display. There are pictures of Sheragi military officials of the time, as well as their names and roles. Details on their culture, their biology, and their apparent conflicts with the Hai are provided as well. There is a huge statue of a bipedal dragon at the center of the room, around 8 meters tall, so large that the ceiling had to be raised. The inscription on the plaque at its feet indicates it is a reproduction of a life-sized Sheragi. A smaller interactive holographic display of one shows details on their biology and behavior. Samples of culture are scarce, but it indicates that they lived under a military meritocracy that valued strength and leadership above all else.`
	"CN-17512" `	You see pictures and rough blueprints of their ships, some depicting fearsome fleets of massive warships. They had angular, multi-layered armor that rivaled the strength of modern Hai vessels by sheer mass. If your measurement conversions are correct, their ships were bigger than anything else in human space, dwarfing even the Navy Carrier. A few of them display equally impressive spinal cannons of unknown capability, with grim descriptions suggesting that they were responsible for the extinction of the Sheragi - weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a warlike and immature species that used them carelessly.`
	"CN-17513" `	While you are looking around the room, one of the curators approaches you, speaking your own language, albeit with a heavy accent.`
	"CN-17514" `	"Sad, isn't it? I don't think they ever had a peaceful time in their spacefaring history."`
	"CN-17515" `	"It's a pity they had to focus so much on conflict. They seemed very capable."`
	"CN-17516" `	"They lived fast, died young, and left good-looking corpses."`
	"CN-17517" `	"Well, it's not like we are ones to talk. At the time, we Hai were a troubled species too. We even tried invading Sheragi territory. Perhaps if we had been successful, they might have united against a common enemy and might have even survived their rebellious phase, at our own expense.`
	"CN-17518" `	The curator laughs in the distinctive Hai way.`
	"CN-17519" `	"That's one way to put it. I can't deny the scale of their engineering was a marvel even for the Hai of that time, and our civilization was already old. Some things scale well with size, and they had no choice but to build big. But it's still a shame. Imagine such capability being used for peace.`
	"CN-17520" `	"Anyway, it's rare to see a human face here, and even more intriguing for them to be staring at Sheragi artifacts. What brings you here?"`
	"CN-17521" `	You explain about the ruins recently discovered on Zug.`
	"CN-17522" `	"Ohhh, right. They used to inhabit the part of human space that is now called the Rim. Are you looking for anything in particular?"`
	"CN-17523" `	"I would like to know more about Sheragi computers," you respond.`
	"CN-17524" `	"Hmmm, computers. The Sheragi built their hardware to last. Very sturdy electronics with redundancies, designed to be able to take a shot and survive. But still, I doubt they would have survived so many thousand years. If you want to identify how their hardware used to work, there are a few documents and manuals the ancient Hai stole from them."`
	"CN-17525" `	"Are they for sale?" you inquire.`
	"CN-17526" `	"You want to buy a copy of the documents? Right now? I'm intrigued. Did you actually find something that still works?"`
	"CN-17527" `	"We found a kind of storage device that seems to still be functioning. A black box."`
	"CN-17528" `	"I'm just curious. Studying their technology might allow us to improve ours."`
	"CN-17529" `	"I see. I'll have to warn you though, following the footsteps of a doomed species can only get you so far.`
	"CN-17530" `	You produce an image of the cube that you found on your holopad. The curator stares at it, and then slowly turns to you with pity in his eyes.`
	"CN-17531" `	"This box is red," he says gently. "I read a thesis once on the prevalence of color blindness in humans, but-"`
	"CN-17532" `	In the interest of time, you interrupt the curator and explain that "black box," in human terminology, refers to a device used to collect and preserve flight data in the event of a catastrophic failure.`
	"CN-17533" `	Recognition seems to dawn on him. "A Sheragi 'black box,' you say? That's an incredible find! Be careful about the information it contains, though. They are a doomed species. Don't you humans have a legend about a cursed box? What was it... Pandora's Box?`
	"CN-17534" `	"In any case... I am not authorized to sell you documents, I just take care of artifacts here. Giving Sheragi technology to humans will likely be a very bureaucratic process. I suggest you contact the Ministry of Culture on Hai-home."`
	"CN-17535" `	You thank him for his help, and make your way back to the spaceport, mentally preparing yourself for what is likely to be a long meeting.`
	"CN-17536" `Arriving on Hai-home, you manage to contact the Ministry of Culture, expressing your interests in obtaining Sheragi documents and manuals. After some time on hold, you're scheduled to meet them in person.`
	"CN-17537" `	You get ready and make your way to the city hall, where the Ministry is, to meet with the Hai officials, who are accompanied by a few diplomats. You all sit down at a round table. You describe the discovery of the Sheragi ruins to them and they begin inquiring more about it, curious about the state of preservation of the ruins and what artifacts were found. They seem very excited.`
	"CN-17538" `	"This is a unique opportunity! Even when our species were in... active contact, millennia ago, we Hai never had the opportunity to study Sheragi cities up close. Brief skirmishes and diplomatic meetings were as close as our ancestors got.`
	"CN-17539" `	"You'll understand, however, that we can't simply sell you the documents you're requesting. Instead, we have a proposition for you: cooperation between our species, so both Hai and human can mutually benefit in ways more significant than the financial one."`
	"CN-17540" `	Given this opportunity, you tell them about the Sheragi black box found in the dig site, and the possibility of decrypting it and uncovering its secrets.`
	"CN-17541" `	"With the proper tools, we could decode it. But in return, we'd like to have a copy of the contents as well, and to learn more about your findings."`
	"CN-17542" `	"Wait, can't I just pay for some help?"`
	"CN-17543" `	"Sounds fair to me."`
	"CN-17544" `	"This is an excellent opportunity for us to learn as well, Captain <last>. We're not going to take anything from you, but rather, it's a mutual benefit."`
	"CN-17545" `	You ponder your choices for a moment. There is no way you could solve this puzzle without their help. You've gone this far, so you agree.`
	"CN-17546" `	"Excellent!" the Hai exclaims.`
	"CN-17547" `	They chat with you a bit more, and the diplomatic leader excuses himself for a moment to make a call. A moment later he returns.`
	"CN-17548" `	"We have arranged for a very capable team of archaeologists to meet you in the spaceport in a few hours. They specialize in Sheragi artifacts. I would advise you to make room for three passengers and some cargo for their equipment."`
	"CN-17549" `	You thank them for their help and leave the building, ready to meet your new team in the spaceport.`
	"CN-17550" `You meet up with the Hai archaeologists that will accompany you to human space, an all female team. They introduce themselves to you as Eyama, Rakei, and Desyo.`
	"CN-17551" `	Eyama is a linguist specializing in the Sheragi language. She playfully greets you in the dragons' rather guttural tongue, with strange tones.`
	"CN-17552" `	Rakei is an archaeological engineer, who immediately takes a liking to the cube as soon as she sees it, examining its structure.`
	"CN-17553" `	Finally, Desyo is a xenoprogramming expert who studies alien software, and seemingly has a lot of experience with Sheragi code. Apparently, the displays of the Sheragi room of the museum all run in this exotic language, unseen by the public.`
	"CN-17554" `	After the brief introduction, they each take their equipment and load it into the cargo bay of your ship. Rakei approaches you after everything is in place.`
	"CN-17555" `	"We want to meet the human archaeologist who uncovered the ruins in the Rim. Can you take us there? We will start examining the cube along the way. I think by the time we get there, we'll have something to work with."`
	"CN-17556" `It was a long trip, almost halfway across the galaxy. The Hai archaeologists have been quite friendly and amiable, giving you updates every time they made a new breakthrough. During this time, the cube, previously thought to be impenetrable, had been disassembled and cleaned. Components that decayed into a mess of oxidized wires and goopy paste over the eons have been identified and removed to substitute for equivalent ones, and a blueprint of the box and its circuits has started to take shape.`
	"CN-17557" `	As soon as you land, you call Albert Foster, who doesn't believe you when you say you've gotten alien archaeologists to help. You then look for the three Hai to figure out how they're going to go unnoticed on a human world. You're surprised to find Eyama wearing long, dark but colorful human clothing with an equally oversized hoodie and a bandanna. You recognize this outfit, very popular with the youth these days, who are generally regarded as delinquents by the previous generation. Additionally, she's carrying two more sets for her Hai partners as well. It hides her body really well at the cost of making her look like a young boy, and the Hai's relatively short stature doesn't help.`
	"CN-17558" `	"Call me Miss Deus ex Machina, because I thought ahead and bought these from a merchant back home. Perfect disguises. The humans will never notice. How do I look?"`
	"CN-17559" `	"That's... clever. It hides you well."`
	"CN-17560" `	"Well, it works, but you look like a child."`
	"CN-17561" `	"Right? I can even hide my tail in the back of the hoodie!" She spins around happily.`
	"CN-17562" `	"That's not that bad, is it? I always considered myself young at heart, anyway!" she giggles a little.`
	"CN-17563" `	"Anyway, can you take us to Mr. Foster's museum? We'll take the cube and fill him in on the details."`
	"CN-17564" `	You agree, and after they're all ready, you make your way out to the dig site. Surprisingly, the three Hai don't get many weird looks if they walk a bit further behind you. You arrive at the museum and they immediately break character by being very obviously excited to see the exhibits. This probably comes as a relief to onlookers, however, who would normally expect that type of kid to vandalize priceless artifacts.`
	"CN-17565" `	Finally, you arrive at Albert's workshop. He stops brushing layers of hardened soil off of an object that looks like it was once a television, and looks startled at you and the three "kids." The Hai take off their hoods and bandannas, causing his jaw to nearly drop to the floor.`
	"CN-17566" `	"I'll be damned. The Hai really exist!" he exclaims.`
	"CN-17567" `	"Of course we do," Eyama laughs. "Haven't you heard all the stories?"`
	"CN-17568" `	"I had my doubts. Merchants are not usually the most reputable sources." He smiles. "I'm Albert Foster, archaeologist, pleased to meet you all."`
	"CN-17569" `	They introduce themselves, and very soon the conversation evolves to a kind of jargon even Albert has trouble following. They talk about the box and their findings, while Albert talks about the history uncovered in the dig site and insights on the Sheragi daily life and culture. You close the door to make sure nobody else is listening in.`
	"CN-17570" `	"We've managed to open the box and we're making a blueprint of it," says Desyo. "Once that's done, we might be able to rebuild the broken pieces and recover the data. We already have documentation on how their hardware worked."`
	"CN-17571" `	"The catch is that this is a collaboration now. We'll help you, if you share your findings with us," Rakei continues.`
	"CN-17572" `	"Sounds like a fair deal to me," Albert says. "We'll arrange the details later. <first>, thank you so much for your help. We'll continue studying this artifact, and we'll send you a message when we're done."`
	"CN-17573" `	You say goodbye to Albert, Rakei, Eyama, and Desyo, and make your way back to your ship. However, as you're walking back to the ship, you feel a heavy hand on your shoulder. You look back, and you're startled to see a Quarg. It's Yarthis, who came to this system to watch over the Sheragi dig site.`
	"CN-17574" `	"I wasn't expecting to see you here."`
	"CN-17575" `	"It has come to my attention that your friends have found a Sheragi black box, and kept it a secret. I am well aware your species view us with distrust, but please understand we only work to prevent extinction. I've been told not to interfere, but I must advise you to be careful with its contents. You will be led to more memories of the Sheragi, and a glimpse at their destruction. But what you find should be seen as nothing more than an oddity, not something to replicate or imitate."`
	"CN-17576" `	It turns around and leaves you without another word.`
	"CN-17577" `You're still in the middle of the post-flight check when you receive a new encoded message from Albert Foster.`
	"CN-17578" `	"Hello <first>. I have some good news! We have decoded what's in the black box. You should come visit us on Zug; we have plenty to tell you!"`
	"CN-17579" `You arrive on Zug, and after contacting Albert and the three Hai archaeologists and following their directions, you find them in an ice cream shop. They're still wearing the youngster clothes, but not even bothering to hide their faces with bandannas anymore. Surprisingly, nobody seems too distressed at the sight. Rakei waves for you and stands up, coming to you with ice creams in paw.`
	"CN-17580" `	"Hello <first>! It seems our disguise worked better than intended. The humans around here think we're wearing a costume. Apparently young humans like to dress up as aliens?" she says confusedly.`
	"CN-17581" `	"I had a feeling we'd fit right in with the furry crowd," Eyama responds proudly.`
	"CN-17582" `	"It has been an interesting cultural exchange. Human space might be a great vacation spot for us. But we're not on vacation yet. We have a mystery to solve," she continues.`
	"CN-17583" `	You sit down with your group on a bench in a nearby park, mostly empty, and Desyo picks up the conversation.`
	"CN-17584" `	"So, the files in the black box were thankfully standard for Sheragi. Not very difficult to decode, once we managed to read them."`
	"CN-17585" `	"What did it contain?"`
	"CN-17586" `	Desyo responds, "It was all fleet movement data and military strategy details. This system was apparently on the border of one of the factions' territories. On the final moments of the recording, a large transport fleet had entered the system, unarmed ships. They were followed by military vessels in pursuit. There's no telling what they thought at the time, but a military fleet was immediately dispatched to eliminate both fleets. One particular ship, the name of which Eyama has translated as 'Emerald Sword,' started behaving erratically when given orders. It fired and missed a few shots until it eventually stopped and fled. Clear signs of a mutiny. However, what is perhaps most interesting is that when it fled, it fled in an unexpected direction, away from any hyperlanes."`
	"CN-17587" `	Albert continues, "We think they wanted to flee from the fighting. These were soldiers scarred by the horrors of the war, and they just got ordered to attack what we assume to be refugees. The Emerald Sword was a big ship, likely with an equally large crew, and from the movement data, its engines were very powerful too, possibly capable of crossing interstellar distances within a Sheragi lifetime. This has some interesting implications. The ship was moving precisely towards a star named Zubenelhakrabi. Not significant enough to show up in the star maps, but we did our survey, and there is a potentially habitable planet there, but zero signs of intelligent life. We think they failed in colonizing it, but the ship might still be there. It's a priceless artifact. We can't know for sure until we get there. Thing is, there is no way to do so."`
	"CN-17588" `	"Unless you have a jump drive," Rakei adds. "And you do have one, don't you?"`
	"CN-17589" `	"I do."`
	"CN-17590" `	"I used to, but not anymore."`
	"CN-17591" `	"This is perfect! Do you think you can get another one? If we're going there, and the ship's remains are still there, we're going to need one to install on the Emerald Sword and bring it back home."`
	"CN-17592" `	"You sold it?" she replies incredulously. "How can you sell such a priceless piece of technology? Well, I hope there is a way to get more of them without having one, because we're going to need two for the next stage. One for your ship, and another one for the Emerald Sword, if its remains are still there."`
	"CN-17593" `	"What do I get in return?" you ask.`
	"CN-17594" `	"Fame and fortune, my friend. And if the ship is still there, I think you deserve to keep it," Albert responds. "You've helped me so much, and you went to hell and back to get this black box decoded. Give us some time to assemble a crew to survey the system and help refurbish the ship, and in the meantime, go get a jump drive for the Emerald Sword. Come back to us once you have it."`
	"CN-17595" `	"You're just going to let me have it? Isn't this something of a priceless historical artifact?"`
	"CN-17596" `	Albert responds, "Well, yes, but I'd feel much more comfortable with it in your hands than sitting here on <origin> waiting to be destroyed in loose fire during a pirate raid. Besides that though, while the Free Worlds work hard and have a stronger presence here than the Navy ever did, they can't stop everyone who may have an interest in this ship. At least with you it's a moving target."`
	"CN-17597" `You have a spare jump drive in your possession. Would you like to give it to Albert's crew?`
	"CN-17598" `	You give Albert a call, and arrange to meet with him to plan the next step. He shows up at your ship, greets you, and starts loading in some equipment, along with the jump drive you brought. He has assembled a crew of around 150 people, including a specialized team of shipyard workers, a large amount of veteran crew members, himself, and the three Hai archaeologists, who are comfortable to let go of their disguise once they're back in your ship.`
	"CN-17599" `	"<first>, meet the people who will help us uncover the fate of the Emerald Sword. I've just briefed them on the situation and what we plan to do. Along with the jump drive, we're going to take some specialized tools with us, which should allow us to repair and outfit the ship in any world we can land on. This might look like a lot of people, but if we want to recover a derelict ship, I suspect we'll need just this many. If you're ready to go, here are the coordinates to Zubenelhakrabi."`
	"CN-17600" `	You thank Albert, and make your preparations for the voyage into the unknown.`
	"CN-17601" `The trip to Zubenelhakrabi is completely normal and calm. When you arrive, a simple scan reveals the system's star is unremarkable, nearing the end of its main sequence phase. Among the planets orbiting it, one is in the habitable zone and shows apparent signs of life, covered in dark green spots under the clouds.`
	"CN-17602" `	You also find the Emerald Sword, but strangely, it is not on the planet, but drifting through space. An enormous ship of angular design, its most striking feature is an incredibly large cannon going through the center of the ship. It is so large the ship might as well have been built around it; you can only wonder about its power. Thankfully, you won't have to find out the hard way; the ship is inert, derelict, ruined from lack of maintenance, and abandoned to the mercy of micrometeorite showers and decay. It seems like it could fall apart if looked at the wrong way... luckily, you have just the right crew for the job.`
	"CN-17603" `	But before you can initiate the approach to the ship, a strange feeling washes over you. First, a feeling of being watched by something far greater. Then, a void in your chest, a deep apprehension you can't shake. A thought forms in your mind, but it's not your own:`
	"CN-17604" `	"You have arrived, human. This was the Sheragi's last stand before their extinction. You would do well not to disturb this place of remembrance." A strong shiver washes over you as the thoughts of "extinction" and "remembrance" are punctuated by an indescribable feeling. As if there is a cold deep within your bones.`
	"CN-17605" `	"What... what is this feeling?"`
	"CN-17606" `	There is a pause. The feeling of being watched becomes intense, as if you're being studied intently.`
	"CN-17607" `	"A human would call it... dread. Regret. Loss. You are standing in the last untouched graveyard of a lost civilization.`
	"CN-17608" `	"I am the guardian of this site. I am also the one who guided you towards the buried city, so your species would bear witness and take heed of the lessons of ones who have long succumbed to their own folly. I did not intend for you to reach this far.`
	"CN-17609" `	"Here is where the Sheragi came to an end. The tools that drove them to extinction are long gone. We witnessed as they cast those tools into the heart of this star."`
	"CN-17610" `	"You mean this ship? Its weapons systems seem to be intact."`
	"CN-17611" `	"What tools?"`
	"CN-17612" `	"Ones capable of crippling an entire world's worth of life."`
	"CN-17613" `	"That ship is just a relic, its weapons a mere trinket. The weapon that perished the Sheragi was indiscriminate. An irrational decision they made for themselves, failing to judge the risk."`
	"CN-17614" `	As that is said, you're overcome by glimpses of memories that are not yours, not clear enough for you to identify what exactly is happening, but you can feel a hellish panic in them.`
	"CN-17615" `	The voice continues: "I know what you seek here. The trinket you covet is of little relevance, even for your own, human standards. But if you wish to possess it, then take it. Show your respect to those who have perished here, learn their lessons, and I will allow it. Perhaps the sight of that vessel will remind the living races of those who have come and gone... and how, despite their great accomplishments, their decision to make war reduced them to graveyards, relics, memories... and dust."`
	"CN-17616" `	The voice, and the overwhelming emotions that came alongside it, disappear as mysteriously as they came. Desyo, who witnessed you speaking into the void, asks whether you feel okay. It seems like no one else heard it.`
	"CN-17617" `You dock with the Emerald Sword and the crew starts working to carefully find a way in, directed by the Hai archaeologists. There is no atmosphere inside, as the life support has long since ceased to work.`
	"CN-17618" `	After patching as many micrometeorite holes as you can find, you use your ship's own life support to restore the Emerald Sword's atmosphere, and connect your ship's power to it to get the ship's systems minimally functional. Once it's in breathable condition, the crew boards the ship and begins getting to work. With the freshly pressurized atmosphere, you can't help but think that it smells like a tomb.`
	"CN-17619" `	Foster divides the crew up into various groups to explore the massive vessel and report back with their findings. "We may be here for a while. There's no telling how long it will take us to get this thing operational again. It has been many thousands of years after all," he says. Foster immediately begins inspecting one of the many Sheragi remains on board, while Eyama, Rakei, and Desyo each explore the ship with their own groups.`
	"CN-17620" `	Within half an hour, the entire ship is swarming with crew members hard at work studying the ship (and the remains of its prior inhabitants) and attempting to get it operational.`
	"CN-17621" `	(Look for Foster to see what he's doing.)`
	"CN-17622" `	(Look for Eyama to see what she's doing.)`
	"CN-17623" `	(Look for Rakei to see what she's doing.)`
	"CN-17624" `	(Look for Desyo to see what she's doing.)`
	"CN-17625" `	(Return to my ship and wait until the Emerald Sword is operational.)`
	"CN-17626" `	You find Foster in a room that appears to have been expanded beyond its original size and converted into a farming facility of some sort. There are rows of dried out soil, its nutrients long gone, with sunlamps suspended above. While most of the crew with Foster is busy studying the farm itself, his attention seems to be on a mummified Sheragi corpse slumped over against one of the walls. You notice that the corpse has a prosthetic wing attached to it, which has survived far better than its host.`
	"CN-17627" `	"What have you found so far?" you ask Foster.`
	"CN-17628" `	Foster doesn't respond at first, so you begin to ask your question again, but he then turns quickly to look at you, then back at the corpse. "Sorry, I was busy daydreaming. What we found. What we found..." Foster's voice trails off as he looks around the room. "Do you hear that banging sound?"`
	"CN-17629" `	"What banging sound?"`
	"CN-17630" `	"I don't hear anything."`
	"CN-17631" `	"Strange. I've asked the others here but they don't hear anything either... Anyway, we've found many amazing things. This farm is just the tip of the iceberg. Given that the Emerald Sword had to be able to survive the long flight through interstellar space at sublight speeds, it's no surprise that the crew had to make the ship self-sustaining. I'm sure there's much we could learn technologically from this ship. But we've also found many... disturbing things..." his voice trails off again.`
	"CN-17632" `	"These bodies tell stories, <last>. Terrible stories. The entrance into this area of the ship was welded shut. Almost all the corpses outside of this area were skeletons, while those inside, like this one, were mummified. My best guess is that at some point after arriving here, they realized that even with a facility like this they'd run out of food in due time." Foster kneels down to get closer to the corpse. "I'm having very vivid visions of it all, almost as if I'm there in the moment, but it's all happening so fast... They turned on each other in desperation. A small group decided to shut the rest off from the food supply, leaving them to starve. Then those in here lived off of what they had left until the life support systems gave out.`
	"CN-17633" `	"In all my years, I've never felt as impacted by my work as I do now. I'm feeling very uncharacteristically... emotional at the sight of all this." Foster turns away from you and wipes a tear from his eyes.`
	"CN-17634" `	"You have every right to be emotional. We've made an amazing but tragic discovery."`
	"CN-17635" `	"The Archon spoke to me when we arrived in the system. Maybe it's having an effect on you too."`
	"CN-17636" `	"Do you think it's because what we're doing might be wrong? We're basically raiding a tomb right now."`
	"CN-17637" `	"Yes. Yes we have," Foster says, sounding more upbeat than before. "Amazing, but tragic. But, amazing," he repeats, as if trying to reassure himself.`
	"CN-17638" `	Foster chuckles nervously at the mention of the Archon. "Perhaps," he says, then pauses. "No. I think the gravity of this situation speaks for itself."`
	"CN-17639" `	"I had that same thought on the jump here," Foster says. "But we're in too deep to turn back now."`
	"CN-17640" `	Foster stands back up and steps away from the corpse. "I should get back to exploring the rest of the ship. No use in staring at corpses all day."`
	"CN-17641" `	You leave the area and see that the large door that was blocking the way into the area is laying against a wall. Foster mentioned that the door had been welded shut, so the crew must have removed it somehow to investigate the area. You notice a large dent in the middle of the door. You aren't sure if that's because of the crew getting into the facility, or from the ship's previous inhabitants attempting to break in.`
	"CN-17642" `	You find Eyama investigating the living quarters of the ship, which consists of long halls lined on either side by bunk rooms. Many of the doors are already opened, suggesting that Eyama has already been through many of them. She comes out of one of the bunk rooms after looking through it and notices you. "Captain <last>! What brings you here?" she asks.`
	"CN-17643" `	"I'm wondering if you've found anything interesting yet," you respond.`
	"CN-17644" `	"Oh, no. Nothing much," she says, sounding somewhat disappointed. "All I've found so far have been largely empty rooms. I would have thought that they would have kept personal items in their bunks, but it looks like they haven't. Or perhaps they were moved for some reason."`
	"CN-17645" `	Eyama moves to the next door in the hallway. Instead of another bunk room though, the door opens to a larger room. Judging by the proximity to the bunk rooms, you'd assume this to have been a lounge area or cafeteria of sorts, but its contents suggest otherwise. The walls are covered with Sheragi writing and paintings, and the floor is scattered with various strange looking objects.`
	"CN-17646" `	"Is this..." Eyama says, trailing off as she approaches one of the writings on the wall.`
	"CN-17647" `	Eyama runs her hand against the writing and begins speaking. The sounds match the guttural tongue with which she first greeted you. She pauses after each sound, as if reading single words or characters. "This is the Sheragi alphabet," she says with awe in her voice. Her attention then shifts to writing elsewhere. She reads it, then translates for you. "It says, 'Rekla have mercy on us.'" Next to the writing is a Sheragi handprint on the wall, one of many scattered throughout the large room. Eyama presses her hand to it, nearly covering it. "This is a young hand."`
	"CN-17648" `	"Why is all this here?"`
	"CN-17649" `	"Who is Rekla?"`
	"CN-17650" `	"From what we know, Rekla was a divine warrior among the Sheragi. Sheragi legends stated that she united the warring Sheragi tribes and led them all to the stars.`
	"CN-17651" `	"This ship has to have traveled between the stars for many of your years in order to reach this system without a hyperdrive. The engines are powerful, so it perhaps took them 120 years to arrive here. Many of the Sheragi would have survived the trip, but would be very old when they arrived. This would have made it difficult for them to colonize the planet."`
	"CN-17652" `	"So they would have needed to reproduce on the way here?"`
	"CN-17653" `	"Does that mean this was a daycare of sorts?"`
	"CN-17654" `	"Yes. At least one, maybe two generations of Sheragi could have been born in that time."`
	"CN-17655" `	Eyama walks over to one of the objects on the ground and picks it up. "These are toys. So yes. This does seem to have been converted into a daycare."`
	"CN-17656" `	Eyama stands up and looks toward the walls. "And these wall writings were used to teach them. These handprints are theirs. There are hundreds of them. And some of these words are their final prayers." Eyama seems to go into a trance as she walks around the room glancing at the many writings on the wall.`
	"CN-17657" `	As Eyama wanders the room, you begin looking at the objects on the ground. One of them catches your eye; a book of massive proportions, slightly over twice the length and width of your average human book, although you imagine it would be perfectly-sized for a young Sheragi. You try to open the book but find that the covers are locked together, and the lock won't budge.`
	"CN-17658" `	"Eyama, check this out," you say, snapping her out of her trance.`
	"CN-17659" `	"Oh, a book?" she asks. She picks up the book and tries to open it herself. Without hesitating she reaches over to the lock and just pulls it right off before swinging open the massive cover.`
	"CN-17660" `	"How did you unlock that?"`
	"CN-17661" `	"It was locked?" Eyama asks with a puzzled look on her face before immediately turning her attention back to the book.`
	"CN-17662" `	She skims the pages. "This is a diary. It seems to be written by an adolescent Sheragi who was born on the ship. They talk about how they've never seen a planet or star up close before, but the adults on board tell them stories of a promised land that they are traveling to. It seems that they were close when this was written, perhaps only a few weeks away from the system."`
	"CN-17663" `	She flips through the pages, getting further into the diary. "When they arrived at the system, they stayed in orbit around the planet. The author doesn't know everything that was going on, but there appeared to have been arguments over whether to land."`
	"CN-17664" `	She then flips more pages. "Some of the Sheragi left to go to the planet, while others stayed behind. It doesn't sound like the split was amiable."`
	"CN-17665" `	She continues to flip through the pages as they eventually turn blank. She then goes back and stops on the last written page. "Part of the remaining crew locked themselves in the hydroponic farm wing of the ship, leaving the rest of the crew with limited amounts of food. 'I'm scared and I don't know what to do.'" Eyama stops reading and closes the book, looking teary eyed. "That was the last line."`
	"CN-17666" `	Eyama wipes a tear from her face. "A sad story, but there are plenty of sad stories in this place. No use in lingering on this one." Eyama puts the book under her arm and walks out into the hallway, going back to checking the living quarters.`
	"CN-17667" `	As you are looking for Rakei, you hear a low hum begin emanating through the ship, followed by the dim glow of the emergency lights being replaced by the bright main lights. You eventually find Rakei with her crew walking through the halls of the underbelly of the ship. "Greetings, Captain," she says. "Is there something you need?"`
	"CN-17668" `	"Have you found anything interesting down here?" you ask.`
	"CN-17669" `	"Nothing out of the ordinary," she responds. "We just finished getting the power back online. We had to swap out some parts that look like they broke of old age. Seems like the power generation was active until the end.`
	"CN-17670" `	"It turns out that the power generation and engines are all one unit, so I guess that's how they were able to make such powerful engines. We're heading to the life support systems now to make sure they're online so that you can safely disconnect your ship."`
	"CN-17671" `	You follow her to the life support systems of the ship, a massive unit designed to scrub carbon dioxide out of the ship's atmosphere, keep the oxygen levels balanced, and warn about any potential leaks in the ship. Rakei finds the main control panel and begins tapping away at it. "Need to make sure this doesn't kill us when we turn it on." After a short while of working on the panel she simply flips a switch, turning it on.`
	"CN-17672" `	"Huh," she says. "That was a bit too easy."`
	"CN-17673" `	"Well we needed to fix the power generation because of how it broke from use, but the life support systems are working just fine."`
	"CN-17674" `	"Do you think the power generation failed before the life support systems did?"`
	"CN-17675" `	"Maybe someone turned the life support systems off."`
	"CN-17676" `	"That could be the case, but life support systems are usually the first set of components that need to be repaired or replaced on any ship as it ages, so maybe someone turned them off before the power generation failed."`
	"CN-17677" `	"That could be the case. Life support systems are usually the first set of components that need to be repaired or replaced on any ship as it ages, so someone turning them off is one way they could work when the power didn't."`
	"CN-17678" `	Rakei looks like her eyes are suddenly drawn to something across the room. You follow her gaze and spot an open doorway, different than the one you entered from. The doorway leads to a sealed airlock. Rakei accesses a panel next to the airlock to see that the other side is pressurized and opens it.`
	"CN-17679" `	On the other side of an airlock you find a large room with what looks like a runway going down the middle, leading to a shielded opening to the void of space. On either side of the room are three hangar bays. You spot that each of the hangars has a ship within it except for one.`
	"CN-17680" `	"Fighters," Rakei says as she approaches one of them and begins examining it. "These look like interesting pieces of technology. I wonder how the Sheragi were able to even fit into one." She runs her hand along the hull of the fighter and sees some Sheragi writing on the side. "'Onyx Chariot.' That's its name."`
	"CN-17681" `	"You can read that?"`
	"CN-17682" `	"I thought Eyama was the linguist."`
	"CN-17683" `	"She is. I guess she's rubbed off on me."`
	"CN-17684" `	"It looks like it."`
	"CN-17685" `	Rakei hops onto the top of the fighter, looking for a way in. She finds a hatch and opens it, looking shocked at what she sees. "Wait. I think these fighters are autonomous. I'm not seeing any signs of a life support system, or even a way that a Sheragi could pilot this. There's barely even enough room for a younger Sheragi to fit in here. If the Sheragi couldn't have piloted these then why is there one missing?"`
	"CN-17686" `	Rakei closes the hatch and hops down from the fighter. "We still need to get other systems working before the ship is fully functional, so we can take a look at these fighters later. And maybe we'll find the missing fighter on the planet."`
	"CN-17687" `	You find Desyo in the cockpit of the ship, overseeing a crew attempting to take control of the ship's computer systems. Makeshift scaffolding has been put in place just so that the crew can reach the controls. "Hello there, Captain," Desyo greets you as you walk in through the massive doorway. "Is there anything I can help you with?"`
	"CN-17688" `	"I'm just curious as to what you've found," you respond.`
	"CN-17689" `	"Not much yet. We've only just finished putting up these structures so that we can properly access the ship's controls. Now we're looking over them to find a main access point of sorts. From there, we can take control of the ship."`
	"CN-17690" `	"Desyo, you might want to see this," one of the crew members shouts. You follow Desyo over to the crew member, who has found a compartment under one of the consoles. Inside, among a mess of Sheragi components, lays a black box that looks exactly like the one that brought you here, and in pristine condition compared to it as well.`
	"CN-17691" `	Desyo excitedly removes the black box from the compartment, detaching it from the ship's electronics and attaching it to a computer of her own. "There's no telling what information we'll be able to find with this! Having this ship's black box will tell us everything about it, from its journey in Zubeneschamali all the way to when the ship lost power!"`
	"CN-17692" `	"Do you think we could find another ship to explore?"`
	"CN-17693" `	"Is it really a good idea to just plug that in like that?"`
	"CN-17694" `	"I don't believe that this box would have any information that would lead us to another ship. But, there's only one way to find out," Desyo says as she begins decrypting the black box.`
	"CN-17695" `	"If you're thinking that this could infect my computer with a virus as a countermeasure, I've already dealt with that. We had to develop a firewall to combat a virus that was in the other black box," Desyo says as she begins decrypting the black box.`
	"CN-17696" `	As Desyo begins extracting information from the box, you begin hearing a strange noise akin to a tea kettle. The noise begins to increase in volume and you pinpoint that it is coming from the box itself, which is now emitting strange white particles and a wave of heat. Others have seemed to notice this as well and have already moved behind cover. "Odd. Never seen that happen before," Desyo says. Before you can move, somebody pulls you and Desyo away from the box. The box suddenly gives off a loud popping noise and parts fly everywhere in an explosion.`
	"CN-17697" `	"Is anyone hurt?"`
	"CN-17698" `	"Did that happen with the last one?"`
	"CN-17699" `	Your question is met with a chorus of "No, I'm fine," "All good over here," and various other affirmations of safety from the crew.`
	"CN-17700" `	Desyo looks at you like you're some kind of alien. "No, nothing like the sort. Don't you think I would have expected that if it had?"`
	"CN-17701" `	Everyone comes out from behind their cover to look at the aftermath. Luckily, no one seems to have been hurt. Desyo walks over to the large scorch mark on the floor left behind by the explosion. "I have no idea what could have caused such an explosion to occur," she exclaims.`
	"CN-17702" `	"How's your computer doing?" you ask.`
	"CN-17703" `	Desyo finds the computer on the other side of the room with a severely cracked screen, but somehow still functional. "Sturdy piece of hardware, isn't it?" she jokes. She begins tapping away at the keys as she squints at the screen. "I can still make out some of what I was able to pull from the cube. It looks like... that cube had some information on a weapon. Some sort of... chemical weapon? It seems to include... mention of coordinates. But that's all I was able to get. Whatever coordinates they were are lost to time."`
	"CN-17704" `	The crew are still standing around in shock as Desyo fiddles with her damaged computer. She looks up to see everyone staring at her. "Well, let's get back to work. We're not going to make any progress just standing around."`
	"CN-17705" `	You return to your ship, and after a few hours Foster contacts you saying that the ship is in operational condition. It'll need to be landed on the planet in this system so that the jump drive can be installed, though.`
	"CN-17706" `As you enter the atmosphere of the alien world, you begin running scans of the air quality to determine if it is safe to breathe. You quickly learn why it is that the Sheragi perished in space; the atmosphere has a high concentration of chlorine gas, fatal to all living creatures aside from those that seem to have miraculously evolved here. The environmental suits brought along "just in case" turn out to be very useful here. The atmosphere would be unhealthy to breathe for long periods of time, and very uncomfortable in the short term, if you didn't bring them.`
	"CN-17707" `	You spend some time searching for a suitable landing spot - one that is high enough to escape the highest concentrations of chlorine gas in the atmosphere, but flat enough to land on. Your scanners eventually spot a flat mesa high above the ground. It turns out the Sheragi found this exact same spot; as you come in for a landing it becomes apparent that there are ruins of a large settlement on the mesa.`
	"CN-17708" `	Among the ruins you spot what looks like a small ship covered in foliage. "That must be the missing fighter," Rakei says.`
	"CN-17709" `	Seeing your confusion, she explains: "We found five fighters on the Emerald Sword, but there is room for six. We figured that the final one might be on the planet."`
	"CN-17710" `	"Well, this is quite the turn of events," Foster says as he looks at the ruins.`
	"CN-17711" `	"You didn't expect to find anything here?"`
	"CN-17712" `	"Do you think we'll find anyone left alive?"`
	"CN-17713" `	"Not after seeing what happened on the ship," he responds.`
	"CN-17714" `	"After thousands of years? I'm not holding my breath," he responds.`
	"CN-17715" `	You land your ship next to the Emerald Sword and the crew gets to work transporting heavy equipment from your ship to the Emerald Sword to finish getting it functional and install the jump drive.`
	"CN-17716" `	Foster and Eyama get into their environmental suits. "Want to join us in investigating the ruins, <first>?" Foster asks. "Rakei and Desyo will be staying here to finish work on the ship."`
	"CN-17717" `	"Sure, I'll come along."`
	"CN-17718" `	"No, I'd rather wait here."`
	"CN-17719" `	You head into the settlement with Foster and Eyama. Not much remains of the ruins, but there is still more than what one would expect to find after such a long time. The buildings were all connected to each other to avoid the exterior atmosphere. They were made of glass, scrap, and a kind of yellowish white plastic, the same plastic that the carapaces of animals here are made of. It's very fortunate that the young life in this planet seems to still be unable to decompose those materials, leaving the ruins only at the mercy of weather and geological processes. They appear to have been melted into shape and built into walls over time, giving the buildings a rounded, anachronistic look, like mud huts made of modern materials. All around the inside there are remains of curtains and rags hanging from the ceiling to the ground. Closer inspection reveals the rags to have traces of exotic chemicals, likely made to react with the chlorine in the air to keep the atmosphere inside breathable.`
	"CN-17720" `	The smaller rooms you come across appear to be just family homes, with a simplistic, single room interior, while the larger ones had other purposes, like what appears to have been a classroom, an animal carapace storage room holding the exoskeletons of many different species, a communal kitchen with remains of a solar oven, and most strikingly, a hatchery with relatively small beds, nests, and makeshift toys strewn about. Most of the rooms are littered with skeletons and remains, from the largest hunter-gatherers to the smallest young ones, a grim scene suggesting that some unknown catastrophe ended their lives all at once. Even then, the Sheragi on the surface apparently survived for much longer than the ones in the Emerald Sword, perhaps for many generations. Had the ship landed, they might have survived to this day.`
	"CN-17721" `	Foster documents and takes pictures of everything that he sees. Although you'd expect him to be excited to see all this, like he was when investigating the Sheragi ruins on Zug, his mood is extremely somber.`
	"CN-17722" `	While in one of the rooms, Eyama spots a young Sheragi skeleton laying on the ground that looks like they were reaching out for something when they died. Eyama kneels down next to the skeleton and reaches out to touch its hand. "Don't," Foster says from across the room, stopping Eyama from moving. "We need to leave this place undisturbed. We've done enough already by taking the ship." Eyama gets up without speaking, but gives a look of understanding to Foster.`
	"CN-17723" `	After spending enough time among the ruins, you return to the ships with Foster and Eyama.`
	"CN-17724" `	The final repairs on the Emerald Sword take up nearly an entire day, with the crew working in shifts to get the job done. Once the ship is patched up and all the systems are functional, the jump drive is installed. While the Emerald Sword was being worked on, Rakei was able to get a group to retrieve the final fighter and return it to the ship. All that is left to do now is to get the ship in orbit and return to <planet>.`
	"CN-17725" `Your exotic new ship draws a lot of attention from the dockworkers, partly because it is unique and never-before-seen, but probably even more so due to the unprecedentedly large cannon. Albert and the Hai archaeologists spend most of the day examining the ship in more detail and recovering the corpses, now that it's in a proper spaceport and they can access more complex equipment. Everything is completed in one particularly busy afternoon, and as night falls, the immense scale of the ship's interior allows more floors to be installed, giving you even more living space.`
	"CN-17726" `	You go back to the same park as before with Albert and the three Hai in partial disguise, ice creams in hand and paws to commemorate the new acquisition.`
	"CN-17727" `	"That is one impressive ship," you mention.`
	"CN-17728" `	"True," Desyo says. "I've never seen a cannon that big before."`
	"CN-17729" `	"I wonder how it works."`
	"CN-17730" `	"That's what she said."`
	"CN-17731" `	Desyo doesn't understand, but Eyama bursts into laughter. "Classic human joke. You see, it implies--"`
	"CN-17732" `	"God, don't explain it," Albert interrupts. "That was terrible. She's right though, that isn't something you see every day. Do you have any idea how it works?"`
	"CN-17733" `	Rakei, who is more knowledgeable in this area, responds. "It's a fusion-pumped gamma-ray laser, or GRASER for short. The device is simple in concept, but the cost involved and the proportion of everything makes it impractical to develop, not to mention that to use it would probably be considered a war crime in many civilizations, thus making R&D not worth it. It's essentially using a nuclear flash to power a laser beam that penetrates and melts everything. Fascinating, but I'm hoping you'll use it only for peacekeeping purposes."`
	"CN-17734" `	Eyama adds, "I've been calling it the Dragonflame Cannon. I think it's appropriate, even though it's technically not a flame in the chemical sense. The dragons of human legends could breathe fire, and although it's unlikely the Sheragi could actually do that, this cannon more than makes up for it."`
	"CN-17735" `	"Do you think I could get in trouble by using it?"`
	"CN-17736" `	"It's not going to blow up my own ship, is it?"`
	"CN-17737" `	Rakei laughs. "Don't worry, the Sheragi did their homework. They used simple materials, which means that the cannon can be maintained and repaired so that it continues to be structurally strong. Many of the components are active anyway, and they basically only exist for the short amount of time that the GRASER takes to fire. I only advise against firing it at point blank range."`
	"CN-17738" `	"I don't think you will, as long as you don't fire it into a planet. It doesn't cause unnecessary suffering like nerve gas, and it isn't as indiscriminate as a nuclear bomb. This is a focused beam. It's going to poke holes straight through any ship subject to its wrath."`
	"CN-17739" `	"Then what's the catch?" you ask.`
	"CN-17740" `	"It eats a lot of power. I mean a lot. And it does that every shot. No single reactor will be capable of making it shoot as fast as it possibly could. Expect to invest a lot in batteries and reactors if you want to re-outfit that warship and still use the cannon."`
	"CN-17741" `	Desyo adds, "Also, don't go thinking you're invincible now. The shield matrix in that ship is incredibly primitive. Almost nonexistent. The hull is strong, but don't rely on it too much. Human technology could probably do better if they tried. No offense."`
	"CN-17742" `	"So what are you going to do now?" you ask them.`
	"CN-17743" `	Eyama responds. "We'll continue working with Albert. These two nerds like technology and ships, but I'm far more interested in the treasure trove of cultural artifacts the buried city holds. Not to mention the humans here are very interesting!"`
	"CN-17744" `	You all finish your ice creams and continue chatting for a while longer before you say goodbye and return to your ship. By tomorrow, it will be in full working condition, ready to take to the endless void.`
	"CN-17745" `Shortly after you enter this system, your ship's sensors begin to register small but progressive damage to the hull and internal systems, despite there being no other ships around. Equally confusing, your jump drive seems to still be partially active.`
	"CN-17746" `The system on the other side of the wormhole is the first one in days that your sensors have not responded to with alarms. Apart from the presence of the wormhole, the space here appears entirely normal.`
	"CN-17747" `After trudging through several shrouded and mostly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. As you enter the planet's upper atmosphere, your ship is surrounded by a trio of interceptors and thoroughly scanned. Soon after, the lead ship transmits a hail to you in a sharply flowing alien language before proceeding to a spaceport complex floating on a large structure along the coastline. The group corrals you onto one of the few fully-dry landing pads, and as the minutes wear on, a small crowd begins to form around your ship.`
	"CN-17748" `	You carefully open the <ship>'s hatch and step outside to make contact.`
	"CN-17749" `	The predominant species of aliens you see here are enormous octopods that rise up from the ground on their long, suckered arms. On average, they stand about three meters tall even with their arms coiled beneath them. Those standing on dry land are joined by others who slither out of a network of water-filled pools and channels to come and watch you. Their skin glistens with mucous wetness and you can see it changing color and texture as they run their hourglass-shaped pupils over your person and your ship.`
	"CN-17750" `	After a couple of minutes of activity within the crowd, one uniformed and especially vibrant individual breaks away from the rest and begins to move towards you, gliding gently and silently over the ground. They say something in the same strange language, shimmering with waves of color, and then wait expectantly for you to reply.`
	"CN-17751" `	You draw your weapon and fire a shot directly at the center of the uniformed alien, but it does not manage to even scorch the fabric of their clothing. Before you have time to fire a second time, you hear an unfathomably loud noise that pushes you back and leaves you dead before your body even makes contact with the ground.`
	"CN-17752" `	The alien shuffles their arms in place and leans their face towards yours, repeating their earlier statement, this time more slowly and at a lower pitch. When you once again fail to give a satisfactory response, they pull away.`
	"CN-17753" `	After a few more moments of silence, the alien grunts in a gesture reminiscent of a sigh of disappointment, then turns away and says something to another uniformed individual waiting on the edges of the now-substantial crowd. The other's skin flashes a bright blue before they leave, gliding towards one of the interceptors now parked alongside your ship.`
	"CN-17754" `	They shortly return, holding in one of their arms a small spherical device, handing it to the alien who seems to be in charge. The leader in turn offers it to you, and burbles an unintelligible phrase in what you might have characterized as an encouraging tone. The individuals making up the crowd are by now stretching over each other to get a look at you, and you can see more of them in the distance gliding and swimming towards your landing site.`
	"CN-17755" `	(Take the device.)`
	"CN-17756" `	(Refuse.)`
	"CN-17757" `	You take the device from the alien. It liquefies the moment it touches your skin before freezing in mid-splash to project a small but detailed holographic star map of the surrounding systems. A star system a few jumps east of here is highlighted amidst a sea of alien lettering. The individual standing opposite you grunts energetically as the trio of interceptors begins to hover in preparation for takeoff: it would appear that these people, whoever they are, want you to travel there.`
	"CN-17758" `	You back away from the alien offering you the strange device and into the safety of the <ship>'s hatch. Though none of the aliens make any move to harm you, you notice from inside that after a couple of minutes, water slowly begins to flow onto the landing pad. As your ship's landing gear begin to submerge, you are forced to take off while you still can.`
	"CN-17759" `Without your Successor escorts, you are refused landing permission at <planet>'s spaceport and must return to orbit until they arrive.`
	"CN-17760" `Like last time, you are escorted by the interceptors to a landing pad on this planet's spaceport. Here, however, they guide you to a small, out-of-the way area at a great distance from the main complex, where several uniformed aliens are gathered on the landing pad, standing at attention.`
	"CN-17761" `	After waiting for several minutes, a shuttle lands on the pad beside yours and several individuals emerge from it. Two of them move in front of the rest, where they are allowed to pass by the guards and approach you. The one on the left is a uniformed officer wearing what appears to be heavy body armor with shimmering metallic plates that sparkle in the light. On the right is a smaller alien who is wrapped up in a dark, cocoon-like outfit from which their head and arms emerge. The officer says something to the smaller one, who quietly replies and then pulls from a pocket on their outfit a smooth sheet which they inspect several times before haltingly addressing you.`
	"CN-17762" `	"Hark... noble visitor! We bid thee... welcome and good tidings." The two eye you closely as they wait for a response.`
	"CN-17763" `	"Hello. I am Captain <first> <last>."`
	"CN-17764" `	"I'm <last> of the <ship>. Pleased to meet you."`
	"CN-17765" `	The two once again proceed slowly and carefully, the speaker briefly conversing with the military officer before each phrase. "I am Sieasej... of House Sioeora among the Successors. Thou'rt a human, art thou not?"`
	"CN-17766" `	"What else would I be?"`
	"CN-17767" `	This sparks a wave of color among the gathered members, most of all Sieasej, who spends several seconds in a vibrant shade of orange before returning to their resting hue. "Then i'tis confirmed. 'Tis a cause for much excitement, <last>, for thou'rt the first of humans that's been met by us in fifteen hundred years, since far before the time thy kind had even left the bounds of thine own planet's clouds. House Sioeora's honored t'be the one that gives thee greeting. So am I, Captain, for my part in it." The members of the group splay their free arms towards you and glisten with ripples of blue across their skin. You perform a short bow in return.`
	"CN-17768" `	"What should I do now?"`
	"CN-17769" `	"What do you mean that you were ripped from the galaxy?"`
	"CN-17770" `	"How could you have met humans fifteen hundred years ago?"`
	"CN-17771" `	"Humans have certainly changed a lot in the last fifteen hundred years."`
	"CN-17772" `	"What is House Sioeora?"`
	"CN-17773" `	"T'was a time in which our Predecessors' home domains reach'd farther to the north, and farther still the reach of their intention to explore. For life, it is a rare and precious thing, and doubly so that life which is possess'd of sapience and culture, that's noble in reason, infinite in faculty, as thine. So then, our Predecessors waited under cloak of dark to silently observe thee in thy glimmering development. And if 'twere not from the rest of the stars so untimely ripp'd, we surely would have had the pleasure t'watch thy kind advance to what's its present point."`
	"CN-17774" `	Sieasej pauses for a moment, wriggling under their cloak. "I am a scholar of some olden languages," they say, "and of the worlds our Predecessors met so long ago. I learned thy tongue, at least as 'twas gone fifteen hundred years ago."`
	"CN-17775" `	"T'is true," they say. "I am a scholar of some olden languages, and of the worlds our Predecessors met so long ago. I learned thy tongue, at least as 'twas gone fifteen hundred years ago."`
	"CN-17776" `	More waves of color, subtle but noticeable, pass over Sieasej's body. "I'd hoped as much," they say, "that thou were't still a younger kind, with a longer history before thee; that thou would'st one day take to the stars as it appears thou hast now done. Alas, mine noble House Sioeora does not permit me t'interrogate thy knowledge so deep as that which I desire, for thine arrival portends t'us much, and so t'is much we must arrange."`
	"CN-17777" `	Sieasej confirms their answer with the uniformed officer before answering your question. "Thou surely must have passed through that awry and fractured swathe of stars to which our modern worlds remain affixed, by however thin and fragile of a thread. 'Tis the citizens of these, long past, whose Successors now we are."`
	"CN-17778" `	"Is that how you know my language?"`
	"CN-17779" `	Sieasej translates your query to the military officer this time, who considers for a moment before saying something back and Sieasej speaks again. "Sioeora is the noble house whose grand estate thou sees around thee. There are many such within the broader realm: the stars this side'f the wormhole, but 'tis Sioeora who has taken patronage on thee, for the keeping of our history is the... core of its desire. 'Twere't thou apprehended by the arms of another," Sieasej says, gesturing towards an interceptor landed on another pad, "thou surely would have languished without recognition as a creature t'was so distant in our past."`
	"CN-17780" `	Sieasej translates this question to the uniformed officer, who conveys a detailed response accompanied by a series of color and texture displays on their skin. Overhead, a buzzing flock of interceptors fly past and land on a set of landing pads closer to the center of the spaceport complex. Eventually, Sieasej responds, and does so even more slowly and carefully than previously. "The noble scions o'House Sioeora have made it known t'others of the High Houses that thou'rt guest within their space and shalt proceed with their protection. Thou may'st explore those of our worlds which offer thee their grace. 'Thout our tongue, though, thou shalt find but few chances to do more than to observe. As to that," Sieasej continues, "our noble scions're set to start their meeting here in eight days time. And as it is that thou hast aroused their close attentions, 'tis expected that thou shalt receive a summons to their union."`
	"CN-17781" `	With that, Sieasej and some of the others depart, leaving you along on the pad with your ship and the ring of guards, who remain silent and at attention.`
	"CN-17782" `As you exit the <ship>, you notice that a group of uniformed Successors are standing at attention on the landing pad. The lead officer approaches you and hands you a small metallic sphere much like the map device you were offered previously. Rather than projecting a map, however, the sphere begins to play a recording when you touch it.`
	"CN-17783" `	"Captain <first> <last>! I've been instructed to inform thee that our most honored scions of noble House Sioeora want that thou woulds't before them appear to render 'them thy service and thine aid. They, hm... demand that thee make haste to our fair world once more, and prepare thyself as pleaseth thou for an audience before them. In confirmation of this message, I do myself attest: Vijaat Ojniis Sieasej, an honored scholar of the third iret in service to our noble House."`
	"CN-17784" `	The recording ends there, and the sphere changes to display a star map as before.`
	"CN-17785" `Soon after you enter the atmosphere of <planet>, the <ship> is flanked by a pair of interceptors which lead you to a sprawling complex in the northern hemisphere at the edge of a large lake. Your escorts set down on two small landing pads near the shore, and you see that another landing pad between them has been lit up in colors matching the livery of your ship.`
	"CN-17786" `	As before, your landing site has been surrounded by a cadre of uniformed individuals, but this time there must be nearly a hundred standing at attention on the pad's perimeter, of which most appear heavily armed. Once again upon disembarking, a lead officer approaches you, accompanied by a group of eight others who follow them in a tight formation. The leader motions with one of their arms towards the center of the complex as if to instruct you to go.`
	"CN-17787" `	(Go with them.)`
	"CN-17788" `	The lead individual looks you over and shuffles their arms somewhat before repeating their motion towards the center of the complex.`
	"CN-17789" `	"Is this where the scions are?"`
	"CN-17790" `	The leader says something to one of the others before returning their attention to you and gesturing again, this time with their weapon.`
	"CN-17791" `	(Go.)`
	"CN-17792" `	Your escort relaxes as you move to walk towards the inner complex, and the group of eight follow you as you approach its outer doors.`
	"CN-17793" `	The inside of the complex is opulent and massive, with vaulted ceilings rising on columns out of the lake water. Some mimic the forms and textures of tree trunks, spreading out on the ceiling into a canopy filled with thin metallic leaves that slowly wave and occlude the lights embedded above them. Each successive hall you pass through is a unique and enormous sculpture: the arch of a wave moments before crashing; the spiral of a huge suckered arm. You eventually arrive at a large door that your escort extends an arm to touch. As soon as they do, it begins to liquefy and flow into a trench on the floor. When it is finished, you step across the threshold into a final circular room where a group of Successors stand waiting. You recognize one as Sieasej, now wearing a new set of metallic-looking robes, but the rest are unfamiliar and are especially richly dressed.`
	"CN-17794" `	One of the adorned individuals looks at you and speaks, and Sieasej translates a moment later.`
	"CN-17795" `	"Hail, captain! We appreciate thy promptness in complying 'thour request. I am Riijaaora, an honored scion of House Sioeora. I shall speak for today for my fellows and the House."`
	"CN-17796" `	"Hail, captain! Thy tardiness reflects poorly upon thee. I am Riijaaora, an honored Scion of House Sioeora. I shall speak for today for my fellows and the House."`
	"CN-17797" `	"Hello. I am <first> <last>."`
	"CN-17798" `	"I apologize for being late."`
	"CN-17799" `	"We are aware of this. The introduction of an alien like thee is not expected or requested in this hall."`
	"CN-17800" `	"Thine apology is noted."`
	"CN-17801" `	Riijaaora continues. "Thy presence we've demanded here so that thou might'st give service to this House. We've a task for thee, and if thou can'st complete't ably, a gift as well: a symbol of our patronage."`
	"CN-17802" `	"What sort of task?"`
	"CN-17803" `	"What sort of gift?"`
	"CN-17804" `	"I do not appreciate being bossed around."`
	"CN-17805" `	"'Tis a world within the scar of shrouded systems to the north th'twas once by name Raaqa-Uur-Kaav. We require thee to visit there, where'pon its surface, thou shall'st go and find a certain beast t'return to us, undamaged and unspoil't. The scholar, Sieasej, shall escort thee: an envoy of this House t'assist and monitor thine efforts. And if thou'rt successful in the fetching of thine quarry, we shall see fit to thee bestow the peerless gift of language, so that thou might'st not evermore require the use of a translator, as doth thou, here and now."`
	"CN-17806" `	"You want me to do your errands? I won't!"`
	"CN-17807" `	"The one who speaks these words to thee know'th well the value language doth confer, and we suspect 'tis true that thee knoweth this as well. There's a world within the scar of shrouded systems to the north th'twas once by name Raaqa-Uur-Kaav. We require thee to visit there, where'pon its surface, thou shall'st go and find a certain beast t'return to us, undamaged and unspoil't. The scholar, Sieasej, shall escort thee: an envoy of this House t'assist and monitor thine efforts. And if thou'rt successful in the fetching of thine quarry, thou shall'st have our reward of language and all that it bestows."`
	"CN-17808" `	"Thine appreciation, or thy failure t'appreciate, are not the sort of things that would concern us in this hall. Thou may'st be an alien, still swaddled in thine ignorance, and yet this makes thee even more a guest upon our worlds and, hm... consumer of our grace. Thy compliance is expected; in return, our generosity."`
	"CN-17809" `	"I apologize."`
	"CN-17810" `	"I have no desire to be your servant."`
	"CN-17811" `	"Thou show'st wisdom in thy choice. Even now, thy ship is being prepared within the spaceport o'this estate. Thou should'st travel there when thine audience is finished, and there begin thy noble task with haste." The scion pauses for a moment before continuing. "But prithee note, dear Captain..." Sieasej shivers with color as the scion speaks the next sentence, "that we do not entrust our citizen to thee 'thout consideration. If harm befalls the speaker of these words whilst under thy protection, or if thou fail'st t'return them here in thirty days, we will consider thee an enemy and levy upon thee every harm that we can muster."`
	"CN-17812" `	A ripple of color runs up the body of Sieasej and several of the other Successors. The scion gives their response slowly. "Then our act of grace today shall be t'allow thee to depart this noble place still possessed o'thy freedom and belongings. Thou shalt receive no further aid nor comfort from this House, and shalt be banished at the pleasure of its scions from whatever worlds lie under our dominion."`
	"CN-17813" `	Sieasej and the scions turn their backs to you, and a line of soldiers converge from the walls to form a line separating you from them. The lead officer who escorted you inside motions with their weapon for you to leave.`
	"CN-17814" `	As you exit, the door closes behind you, reforming into solid metal.`
	"CN-17815" `You are met in House Sioeora's spaceport by Sieasej, who has shed the adorned metallic robes they wore in the presence of the scions for a more robust and rugged cocoon-like outfit. "Ah, Captain <last>," they say. "Thou conducted thyself well with the scions of the House. Well enough for an alien, at least."`
	"CN-17816" `	"Thank you. What can you tell me about our mission?"`
	"CN-17817" `	"What do you mean, 'well enough for an alien?'"`
	"CN-17818" `	A ripple of a rough, greenish texture passes over Sieasej's skin before subsiding. "Audiences like that one are subject to a litany of social expectations. If thou were't one of us, then thine ignorance of these things would seem knavish at the least, but... the scions are not fools. They are more than willing to endure a little bit of rudeness for the sake of their aims."`
	"CN-17819" `	"I see," you say. "I suppose I am too."`
	"CN-17820" `	"Fret not," Sieasej says, "for elegance of thine address was neither expected nor required. It's all that has a place and time where's needed, and a place and time where's not."`
	"CN-17821" `	Sieasej shuffles their arms beneath them. "Ah. I must again speak on behalf of Sioeora." They produce another metallic data-sphere from a pouch on their outfit and offer it to you. "This sphere shall thee provide a marker for the system we're to journey to. On the second planet's second moon, we are to land and find a Kijra-riitaa, a Kijra-'pet,' a beast of sorts, as the scions told thee prior in thine audience with them."`
	"CN-17822" `	"We'd better get started, then."`
	"CN-17823" `	"What did you mean that jump drives are 'familiar?'"`
	"CN-17824" `	"Do the scions have their own jump drives?"`
	"CN-17825" `	"What more can you tell me about these Kijra-pets?"`
	"CN-17826" `	"How does Sioeora even know that the Kijra-pets are on this moon?"`
	"CN-17827" `	"Are you certain you're okay going with me?"`
	"CN-17828" `	"Is there anything I should watch out for?"`
	"CN-17829" `	Sieasej shivers a little, and chooses their words slowly. "The Kijran are quite well-discussed in the history of our people. 'Twere favored pets and hunting beasts among... a few of our Predecessors in their time. The larva is the scale of a... hm, of thy head, though, give or take; with a delicate body and glassy skin, and wings of finest silk. But if it mates and lays its eggs, it gives itself some sundry molts till'ts larger and more fearsome to defend its nascent brood. The Kijran-Riitaa - the Kijra-'pets' - are the young of these, and the Kijran-Khora the dread adults. If thou art wise," Sieasej emphasizes this with a wave of color, "thou shoulds't capture the young and nothing else."`
	"CN-17830" `	"'Tis a mix of things," Sieasej says. "The... paths in space which connect those stars are ever-changing, year by year. A hazard of the space. Some years ago, t'was a pathway leading to it through which craft of all the Houses could find passage and explore. Now, it's been closed for many years and our vessels may not enter. The scions know thou must possess a jump drive in order for thou t'ave reach'd us here, for this technology's a familiar one to us. And so they know thou cans't retrieve that thing which they desire."`
	"CN-17831" `	"Remember, Captain, our Predecessors did ply the stars for ten thousand years before we last set eyes on thine own race, who then had only just discovered industry. Drives like the one within thy ship have been known to us for long into thy past."`
	"CN-17832" `	"That is not for me to know, nor, I think, for thee."`
	"CN-17833" `	Splotches of orange color emerge at the tips of Sieasej's arms. "I confess this is a little strange, and know the prospect of this... journey instills within me some thoughts of trepidation. But to visit these worlds is reward itself, and to do so in thy company, the very aliens who I have studied, makes it a reward that's doubly grand. Thou must realize that thou'rt a historian's dream. Thou'rt a creature from a distant story-page made flesh and blood in the modern age."`
	"CN-17834" `	"The House hast warned me of the dangers which that space entails. Thy vessel must've endured enough to make it here intact, so I must trust that it shall be enduring once again."`
	"CN-17835" `	"I agree," Sieasej says. "We have no time to squander."`
	"CN-17836" `Some minutes after you enter the system, Sieasej enters your ship's cockpit and directs you to a location in the planet's southern hemisphere, on the edge of one of the smaller continents. "Here, captain," they say, "'twas a place where once the beasts were bred. When last our vessels traveled here, 'twas this location where they noted many Kijran-Riitaa."`
	"CN-17837" `	As you approach the coordinates to land, you see that it contains the remains of a substantial complex; over a dozen large buildings and several disused landing pads are present, connected by paths of smooth, untarnished metal. The materials show a curious quality of being both unblemished and overgrown - vines cling to otherwise-spotless walls, and the various walkways, though often shaded by large plants, do not show any debris or detritus on their surfaces.`
	"CN-17838" `	You set the <ship> down on one of the landing pads and exit onto the surface, though not before retrieving a net from storage. You are accompanied by Sieasej, who holds aloft a cylindrical device which they wave in the air for several seconds. "It hears calls of the creatures on the wind, gentler than our ears would notice. So we're fortunate, captain. We will not have to travel far." They wave their device around some more, making slower but wider motions, before they eventually speak again. "The nearest among them lies to the west, a little distance along the path."`
	"CN-17839" `	You set the <ship> down on one of the landing pads and exit onto the surface, though not before retrieving a net from storage, along with <a tranq h2h long> as an improvised tranquilizer weapon. You are accompanied by Sieasej, who holds aloft a cylindrical device which they wave in the air for several seconds. "It hears calls of the creatures on the wind, gentler than our ears would notice. So we're fortunate, captain. We will not have to travel far." They wave their device around some more, making slower but wider motions, before they eventually speak again. "The nearest among them lies to the west, a little distance along the path."`
	"CN-17840" `	(Approach the location.)`
	"CN-17841" `	"You know a lot about tracking for a scholar."`
	"CN-17842" `	"Ah," Sieasej says, pausing for a moment. "A product of some training I've not used in many years. Perhaps Sioeora's forward-thinking as much as they'd have us believe."`
	"CN-17843" `	You make your way along one of the walkways to the west, brushing aside the enormous leaves of the overgrowing plants. Sieasej continues to wave their triangulation device in the air and quietly relays your progress; as you get closer, you hear a gentle scuffling that you realize precedes every detection by the device. After making your way through one particularly-dense wall of flora, you spot your target: a glassy-winged animal perched in a plant over the walkway's edge, probing the branch it stands on with long feelers extending from its head.`
	"CN-17844" `	(Try to tranquilize it.)`
	"CN-17845" `	(Try to catch it with a net.)`
	"CN-17846" `	(Stay still and try to capture it without aggression.)`
	"CN-17847" `	You take aim and fire a blast from the <tranq h2h> at the animal, but it darts away at the last moment so that the blast only just grazes its body. It plummets to the ground shrieking, and while it soon goes quiet as the tranquilizer takes effect, the shriek is echoed by other animals in the area. Soon after those quiet as well, your ears are pierced by a loud, warbling wail from the distance.`
	"CN-17848" `	You take aim and fire a blast from the <tranq h2h> at the center of the animal. It briefly jumps to escape but soon plummets to the ground in a puff of leaves and dusty feathers.`
	"CN-17849" `	You toss a net over the animal and it falls to the ground, where it shrieks for a duration before going quiet. The shriek is soon echoed by similar ones from other animals in the area, and once those go quiet as well, your ears are pierced by a loud, warbling wail in the distance.`
	"CN-17850" `	The animal remains stationary as well, examining you closely. Its eyes are large and furtive, with bright red irises and the same hourglass-shaped pupils as the Successors. After it looks you over, it eventually approaches your hand, sniffing it gently and brushing its downy forelimbs against your skin.`
	"CN-17851" `	(Try to bring it back with food alone.)`
	"CN-17852" `	(Tranquilize it now.)`
	"CN-17853" `	(Catch it with a net.)`
	"CN-17854" `	You retrieve a morsel of food and offer it to the Kijra-pet, which sniffs it extensively before starting to eat, trilling quietly as it takes a couple of small bites. It tucks its wings behind its body like a dragonfly and unfurls two long feather-like antennae from its head, which join its legs in feeling your skin and clothing. Soon, it hops on your arm while sniffing at your pockets, cooing and probing deeper into the one where you kept the food. You begin the walk back to your ship as it continues to explore your pockets, careful to not frighten the animal with any sudden movements.`
	"CN-17855" `	"'Tis no surprise," Sieasej says, "that 'twere such valued pets if their demeanor is so docile and agreeable." They tuck their triangulation device away in a pocket of their own and slither alongside you.`
	"CN-17856" `	While the animal is distracted, you take aim and fire a shot from your <tranq h2h> at it. It briefly jumps to escape but soon plummets to the ground in a puff of leaves and dusty feathers.`
	"CN-17857" `	While the animal is distracted, you toss a net over it and it falls to the ground, where it shrieks for a duration before going quiet. The shriek is soon echoed by similar ones from other animals in the area, and once those go quiet as well, your ears are pierced by a loud, warbling wail in the distance.`
	"CN-17858" `	You scoop up the tranquilized animal, careful not to damage its extremities, and begin the walk back to your ship.`
	"CN-17859" `	(Grab it and run!)`
	"CN-17860" `	You scoop up the immobilized animal and begin to run back to your ship as the wailing behind you increases in pitch and intensity. As you and Sieasej dash through the foliage, the sunlight overhead is suddenly darkened by the shadow of something flying overhead.`
	"CN-17861" `	(Keep running.)`
	"CN-17862" `	(Try to shoot at whatever is above me.)`
	"CN-17863" `	Suddenly, the shadow disappears and the wailing stops. You keep running towards your ship, but can't shake the feeling that you are being watched.`
	"CN-17864" `	You draw your sidearm and look to see what's above you, but the shadow is suddenly gone and you are left staring up into the sunlight and leaves. The wailing has stopped as well; indeed, the whole area remains eerily quiet as you continue to run towards your ship.`
	"CN-17865" `	When you arrive, however, you find that blocking your entry to the <ship> are two large creatures. Their glassy skin resembles that of the smaller creature you captured, but they are each several meters in size. Their feelers, rather than soft and downy, are whiplike and serrated and tipped with vicious-looking barbs that they thrust towards you and Sieasej upon noticing your presence. Their many eyes flick back and forth between you and the animal that you captured, and the two let out a loud wail in unison. Waves of red and blue run down Sieasej's body, probably an expression of fear.`
	"CN-17866" `	(Run past them.)`
	"CN-17867" `	(Shoot them with my sidearm.)`
	"CN-17868" `	(Order my crew to fire a turret at them.)`
	"CN-17869" `	(Release the animal that I captured.)`
	"CN-17870" `	You attempt to run past the creatures, but before you can even get close, one of them swings its barbed feeler at you, lodging it deep in your chest. The last thing you see is Sieasej hurrying away as the creatures pursue them as well.`
	"CN-17871" `	You draw your sidearm and fire at the creatures, striking one in its midsection. It crumples, and immediately after the other one charges at you. Just in time, you are able to shoot that one as well and it tumbles to the ground, kicking up dirt and leaf litter and wailing before going silent.`
	"CN-17872" `	You radio to the <ship> and order your crew to fire a turret at the creatures. The power of starship weapons fired at such close range is enough to quickly and unceremoniously dispatch the pair before they have the opportunity to attack.`
	"CN-17873" `	You gently set the animal you captured on the ground in front of you and back away from it slowly, shuffling to the side as the two larger creatures approach it and stroke it gently with their feelers. The smaller one wriggles a little before unfurling its gossamer wings and flitting away into the foliage. The two larger ones eventually follow, though not before one turns around to look at you and Sieasej and vocalizes.`
	"CN-17874" `	You gently coax the animal off your arm and onto the ground in front of you, backing away from it slowly and shuffling to the side. It runs towards the larger two creatures, touching the tips of its feelers against theirs and trilling softly as before. After some time, it wriggles a little before unfurling its gossamer wings and flitting away into the foliage. The two larger ones eventually follow, though not before one turns around to look at you and Sieasej and vocalizes, a longer, lower trill almost like a cat's purr.`
	"CN-17875" `	With the larger animals dispatched, you and Sieasej dash into your ship with your quarry safe in tow. The waves of color running over Sieasej's body slowly fade. "Well done, captain," they eventually say. "I'm sure Sioeora will be pleased with thee."`
	"CN-17876" `	While Sieasej returns to their cabin, you store the captured Kijra-riitaa in a spare animal-transport cargo container in the <ship>'s hold. It seems to dislike being caged, growling gently and pacing the container, kicking up bits of the straw inside.`
	"CN-17877" `	(Leave it be.)`
	"CN-17878" `	(Put some more bedding in the container.)`
	"CN-17879" `	(Release it.)`
	"CN-17880" `	You rummage around in the other cargo containers until you find a bit of spare fabric scraps and leaf litter, a couple of handfuls of which you add to the animal's cage. With that sorted out, you make your preparations for takeoff.`
	"CN-17881" `	With the animal stowed away, you make your preparations for takeoff.`
	"CN-17882" `	You open the container's door and coax the Kijra-riitaa out of your ship. It takes flight shortly after stepping outside, soon disappearing into a speck against the vast blue sky. With nothing left to do here, you make your preparations for takeoff so that you can at least return Sieasej to their people.`
	"CN-17883" `	The waves of color running over Sieasej's body slowly fade once the animals are gone. "I confess I hadn't picked thee for such a tender soul," they eventually say.`
	"CN-17884" `	"I only did what I thought would get us back alive."`
	"CN-17885" `	"It wasn't right to hurt them."`
	"CN-17886" `	"Ah," they say. "We are fortunate, then, they thought the same of us."`
	"CN-17887" `	"Ah," they say. "Well I, for one, shall thank thee for thy prudence." After a delay, they add, "Even if my noble house shall not."`
	"CN-17888" `	Sieasej briefly waves their device in the air unsuccessfully. "Nonetheless," they say, "thine act of mercy here entails us failure. Under threat, the adults shall surely shroud their issues, and so it is now here. It seems we must return with empty arms." They briefly undulate in a manner similar to a laugh. "I do not think I'd take another chase like that again regardless."`
	"CN-17889" `	The two of you return to the <ship> and make preparations for takeoff so that you can, at the very least, return Sieasej to their people.`
	"CN-17890" `As before, you are directed to House Sioeora's private spaceport in the northern hemisphere, where a landing pad has already been cleared for your arrival. You and Sieasej are given fewer escorts than before, and you can't help but wonder if the absence of your quarry is particularly conspicuous to them. Soon enough, you once again arrive in the scions' chamber, where Riijaaora and the others stand waiting for you.`
	"CN-17891" `	"Hail, captain <last>!" Riijaaora says, this time speaking with their own voice. The sounds feel warped and uneven, as if they are being rearranged midair. "Tell us, hast thou brought that item of our desiring?"`
	"CN-17892" `	"No, I have not."`
	"CN-17893" `	"I was almost killed! I'm done doing your dirty work."`
	"CN-17894" `	A flash of black, ruffled skin passes over Riijaaora's body. Several of the other scions perform similar displays. "'Tis a shame, captain," they say. "If thou can'st offer no utility to this House, then we see little point in retaining thee as an ally, much less rewarding thee for thy absent service. Trouble us no more, and begone." They turn around to face away from you, and the guards slowly peel away from the walls to escort you out. Sieasej remains watching until the door closes shut behind you.`
	"CN-17895" `	As you return to the landing pad, you notice that while your ship has been refueled, the pad itself is slowly being flooded in a none-too-subtle gesture that encourages you to leave.`
	"CN-17896" `As before, you are directed to House Sioeora's private spaceport in the northern hemisphere, where a landing pad has already been cleared for your arrival. Before leaving, you retrieve the caged Kijra-riitaa from the <ship>'s cargo bay. The animal looks a little pitiful with its wings folded up and body curled into a ball, but appears otherwise undamaged. You and Sieasej are given fewer escorts than before; what escorts you do have direct you deeper into the complex. Soon enough, you once again arrive in the scions' chamber, where Riijaaora and the others stand waiting for you.`
	"CN-17897" `	"Hail, captain <last>!" Riijaaora says, this time speaking with their own voice. The sounds feel warped and uneven, as if they are being rearranged midair. "We see that thou hast returned from thy hunt successful!"`
	"CN-17898" `	Riijaaora wriggles their body in what might be an expression of joy before they and the other scions splay their arms before you. "Thou hast done this House great service, captain," they say. "We would be proud to call thee 'ally,' and reward thee for thine usefulness." One of the military officers standing beside the scions moves towards you and gently takes the caged animal from your hands. It chirps quietly as you hand it over.`
	"CN-17899" `	Riijaaora gestures to a small wooden pin affixed to the outer layer of their clothing. "We keep a number of these devices, full of sound and language, but very few for thine own tongue. This one... 'tis an art piece, issued many years past for a performance of thine own Shakespeare's Tempest so that our noble Predecessors could experience the work in its truest form. It is now thy promised gift."`
	"CN-17900" `	Riijaaora plucks the device from their outfit and offers it to you.`
	"CN-17901" `	The device is made of carved wood, or at least something that appears like it, depicting in well-varnished grain a sailing ship washed against rocks. As you pin it on your jacket, the ship begins to gently rock in place and you feel a soft tingling in your ear canals. Riijaaora turns away from you to speak to Sieasej. "And think not, fair citizen, that thine own contributions shall go without recognition. Thou shalt be rewarded, too, for thy part in this." Riijaaora gestures for another officer to escort them away, though not before Sieasej offers you a short splay of their arms as a goodbye.`
	"CN-17902" `	An officer approaches you to offer you a data-sphere. "Within this," Riijaaora says, "lies knowledge of the history of most worlds within our space. Combined with thy newfound skill of tongues, thou should'st find our worlds and cities more revealing to thy gaze and more fruitful for thine efforts. Thou shall'st be permitted to looks upon our creations and our vessels. Should'st the prospect interest thee, we're sure that the other Houses in their council would agree to extend thee purchase rights, provided thou displays to them thy beneficence and utility. There're many minor tasks which need completion on our worlds; no doubt thy prompt assistance would help in such ingratiation to the others." Riijaaora wiggles. "'Tis all, unless thou hast more questions thou needeth us t'resolve?"`
	"CN-17903" `	"I have no questions."`
	"CN-17904" `	"Will being your ally bring me into conflict with the other Houses?"`
	"CN-17905" `	"What are you going to do to the animal?"`
	"CN-17906" `	Riijaaora's skin blotches with colors. "Surely not, we think. For none would make so bold a slight as t'endanger the vassal of another. Thou may'st travel 'tween our stars 'thout fear."`
	"CN-17907" `	"'Tis none of thy concern, fair captain. Though, if thou fear'st cruelty on our part, know well thy gift shall be by us well-kept and well-preserved. Fear not for it, and quell thy doubtful heart."`
	"CN-17908" `	"Good. We bid thee good farewells, then, and good tidings in thy travels." Riijaaora and the other scions turn around to face their backs towards you. The officers who escorted you in escort you back out to your ship through the various sculptural passages of Sioeora's complex.`
	"CN-17909" `Shortly after you set the <ship> down on <origin>, you notice a faint trilling coming from your cabin on board. After rummaging through some of your belongings, you discover that it is coming from a Successor data-sphere, which is vibrating intensely. You pick it up, and it projects a message in a strange-looking alien script that you unfortunately do not recognize. If you ever acquired some alien translation equipment, you might be able to decode it.`

	"CN-17914" `	(Don't decode it.)`

	"CN-17918" `		AUDIENCE OF HUMAN CAPTAIN, HOUSE KAATRIJ REQUESTS`
	"CN-17919" `		HOUSE KAATRIJ [REQUESTS, REQUIRES] AUDIENCE OF HUMAN CAPTAIN`
	"CN-17920" `	The sphere slowly switches back and forth between displaying this message and a map to a system in western Successor space.`
	"CN-17921" `As you enter this planet's atmosphere, the data-sphere begins to trill again and projects a different map, this time highlighting a set of coordinates on the night side. You adjust your course to fly there, setting down the <ship> on a patch of land next to a large lake. The data-sphere offers no further guidance.`
	"CN-17922" `	A couple of animals swim in the water in the distance, making faint honking sounds every once in a while that linger in the starlit air.`
	"CN-17923" `	(Look around.)`
	"CN-17924" `	The glow of the <ship>'s lights attract a swarm of flying insect-like creatures that vainly dive at them again and again. A gentle breeze ripples through the leaves of the flora surrounding the lake.`
	"CN-17925" `	(Check my sensors.)`
	"CN-17926" `	Inside, a light on the cockpit control panel flashes as if your ship were being scanned, but there's nothing on the sensors, and the alert disappears almost immediately after it began. Soft thunderclaps from a distant storm startle the animals on the lake and they leap up into the air before gliding back down onto the water's surface some distance away.`
	"CN-17927" `	(Step outside.)`
	"CN-17928" `	The minutes of the night wear on and, curious, you step out on your ship's boarding ramp to get a better view of your surroundings, to no avail. Despite this, you continue to wait. Eventually, after the night has worn on a little more, you hear the sound of water rushing; a small vehicle emerges from the lake and parks itself alongside your ship. A couple of Successors get out, one of whom approaches you.`
	"CN-17929" `	"Captain <first> <last>," they say. Their voice sounds strange, like their words are being carried from a great distance on the wind; the sounds ripple and bend as they speak them.`
	"CN-17930" `	"That's right."`
	"CN-17931" `	"Hmm. Good. I'm an envoy of the noble scions of House Kaatrij. I attest this myself as Saajret, of Somber Sejra." Saajret's skin erups with green splashes as they say this. "Thy lib'ral patience is well-appreciated." They splay their arms in the same manner as when you were first greeted by the Successors, and the two others behind them do so as well. "Ah," they continue, "but thou surely must be curious as to why we've called thee here. Thine actions, knowing or not, have benefited this noble House, and 'twould be craven fools to fail to recognize that fact. Prithee understand thee now that Raaqa-Uur-Kaav was our world and not Sioeora's. So too, the Kijran, ours, were never theirs to hold or grasp for."`
	"CN-17932" `	"So the Kijran belong to you?"`
	"CN-17933" `	"How is it that you can communicate with me?"`
	"CN-17934" `	"What is next?"`
	"CN-17935" `	"Will your supporting me cause conflict with House Sioeora?"`
	"CN-17936" `	"Can you tell me more about yourself?"`
	"CN-17937" `	"You mentioned earlier that the Kijran 'belong' to you?"`
	"CN-17938" `	Saajret shivers with texture. "More than just 'belong to us,' 'tis true. The Kijran - Kiitaa and Khora alike - are our creations, bred and shaped as the hybrids of a dozen strains. Why was it that the life of our world endured while the life of the rest has long since perished, eroded by the harshness of the gravid void 'tween blasted stars? 'Twas the old House Kaatrij that strengthened their children against this decay. That we were forced to leave them behind was one among many sorrows, and 'tis much better thy quarry flies free than for another House to subject our charges to their whims.`
	"CN-17939" `	"Ah, there's that matter. Much as the High Houses might prefer to believe that they, or rather we, act all within the veil of secrecy, we're all too intertwined to keep our projects hidden for too long. The details of thine arrangement with Sioeora and its repercussions were apparent t'us soon after its conclusion. And surely too, will the details of this meeting eventually become apparent to the other Houses and their scions."`
	"CN-17940" `	Saajret pauses for a moment to straighten some aspects of their clothing, before gesturing to a small wooden pin affixed to an outer layer of fabric. "We keep a number of these devices, full of sound and language, but very few for thine own tongue: this is the only one for which that we possess. I'm told it is an art piece, commissioned for a performance of thine own Shakespeare's Tempest so that our Predecessors could experience the work in its original form. 'Tis far too old and rare for it t'marry with our equipment; and so the need to contact thee in the words of another."`
	"CN-17941" `	Saajret plucks the device from their outfit and offers it to you.`
	"CN-17942" `	The device is made of carved wood, or at least something that appears like it, depicting in well-varnished grain a sailing ship washed against rocks. As you pin it on your jacket, the ship begins to gently rock in place.`
	"CN-17943" `	"'Tis a gift from House Kaatrij to thee, Captain," Saajret says. "Thou hast rendered service to this House, and in return we'll do the same for thee. So long as thou wear'st it, it shall translate our words to thee and thine to us. Pray treat it kindly, for it's unique enough that we cannot offer replacement." Saajret splays their arms again as if to emphasize the end of the statement.`
	"CN-17944" `	Saajret hums in a way you can't quite place. "Sioeora will no doubt be upset that one of the New Houses now patronizes the alien they first met, but they are forced enough to swim in the water that they themselves have salted. Thou shouldn'st fear their ire, beyond their politicking, and that is something we are used enough to living with."`
	"CN-17945" `	A wave of pink cascades along Saajret's arms before they reply. "I am Saajret, honored citizen of noble House Kaatrij, member of the somber noble line of House Sejra, which no longer stands as naught but a banner under Kaatrij's watchful wings. Ah. Not all our Houses survived the fall: Jaasii, Vejret, Ijridanii, Sejra, and many more were lost forever, their families splintered and histories broken. Kaatrij absorbed the citizens of some into itself, and now'ts a patchwork that reminds us that we're all patchworks, metamorphic and composed. My roles in it are many, but first among them, I am an archivist, of sorts. I am t'preserve the old technology that still remains in our possession and, when necessary, put it to use, as best as we judge it can be."`
	"CN-17946" `	Deciding that you've waited long enough, you activate the <ship>'s repulsor thrusters and return to orbit.`
	"CN-17947" `	Saajret produces a data-sphere and hands that to you as well. "Within this," they say, "is historical data for most of the worlds within our space. Combined with thy newfound graces of our language, thou should'st find thine efforts of our worlds and cities t'be more revealing and fruitful. Officially, thou shalt be a patronized guest of House Kaatrij and shall proceed with our protection and our blessings. Thou may'st be able to purchase a certain set of petty works without frustration, but most of our technologies require vetting that, as an alien, may take thee time and effort to fulfill. Should'st the prospect interest thee, thine assistance with jobs and other tasks would doubtless help to prove thee t'be an ally to our people."`
	"CN-17948" `	Saajret pauses to adjust their clothing once again. "I must bid thee now farewell, Captain <first> <last>. Kaatrij will continue t'apprise ourselves of thine actions. I hope that next we speak shall be on equally positive terms." With this, Saajret and their escort return to the vehicle, which glides back into the lake. By the time that the <ship> is ready to take off, the ripples on the water have almost entirely dissipated and the first glimmers of sunlight are creeping over the distant hills.`
	"CN-17949" `Soon after you set down in the spaceport here, you are approached by a group of Successors in naval uniforms, clearly and surprisingly in the employ of multiple various High Houses; there is some variance in the design of the uniforms of different members. Their leader addresses you in a calm tone with the unmistakable coolness that military officers seem to hold regardless of species, their skin remaining a flat gray throughout.`
	"CN-17950" `	"Captain <last>. The High Houses have noted thine actions in their space, and, wishing to make thee a stronger ally to their cause, have summoned thee to meet them in council. Thou art encouraged to make haste to the <system> system.`
	"CN-17951" `	"Thank you for telling me. I'll prepare to travel there immediately."`
	"CN-17952" `	"What do you mean 'meet them in council?'"`
	"CN-17953" `	"The Houses often meet together t'determine what's t'be done about those things which matter to them all. Several del'gates of the High Houses hath gathered t'decide their plans for thee now that thou's proved thy usefulness and goodwill. More than that, I cannot say."`
	"CN-17954" `Once you have sat down at the spaceport, you are met by another group of Successor naval officers. You notice that this group appears even more diverse than the last, representing several different uniform styles and liveries. Unifying them all is a small white and blue pin attached to their outfits; one that does not correspond to the insignia of any of the High Houses. The officers guide you, politely but firmly, to one of the monorail trains snaking out from the spaceport to other installations on the planet, and you all shuffle together into one of the cars, which appears to have been completely cleared of normal passengers, if it even carried those in the first place.`
	"CN-17955" `	Several minutes later, the monorail deposits you at an especially large and well-decorated complex that swarms with both military and well-dressed civilians, some of whom appear so opulent and bejeweled that you suspect their personal effects are worth more than most starships. Each of them without exception wears the same white and blue insignia as your escorts, though many have incorporated it into their clothes' design or even display it as a pattern in skin coloration.`
	"CN-17956" `	As your escort peels off into the crowd, you see a familiar face in the distance: Sieasej, the Successor scholar, who visibly perks up when they see you and then approaches.`
	"CN-17957" `	"Captain! Well-met again! Thou hast arrived at a fortunate hour, for there's still some minutes 'fore this day's meetings are scheduled to begin."`
	"CN-17958" `	"Can you explain what's going on here?"`
	"CN-17959" `	"How has House Sioeora been?"`
	"CN-17960" `	"This is a diplomatic world for envoys of the Houses to meet in council, resolve disputes, bicker, fight, and unify. And I suspect for thine own case, to offer special dispensation to useful citizens and patronized aliens."`
	"CN-17961" `	"Our mutual patrons remain their usual selves, with all that this entails. Would'st thou believe that Riijaaora themself informed me of thine invitation here? They've made themself a leader 'mong the others for their fruitful advocacy of thee... ah, but I digress. Let it suffice to say that Sioeora doubtless shall support thee here today, for thou'rt by now a successful investment on their part."`
	"CN-17962" `	"Ah, do they approve o'thy presence here and that?" Sieasej briefly examines a suckered arm before leaning in a little closer. "'Tis true the scions of my honored House remain towards thee a little chilly; and doubly so for thy finding of another patron which, I confess, may be what irks them most. Thou nonetheless remaineth a person of interest to them, and I suspect they'd be quite pleased to know that I'd encountered thee in council. So, let them brood, I say, for if Sioeora requires thee once more, they shan't be so knavish so's not to make thine acquaintance 'gain, methinks."`
	"CN-17963" `	"We'd better begin, then."`
	"CN-17964" `	"Council?"`
	"CN-17965" `	Sieasej briefly turns a shade of green in a display you might almost characterize as blushing. "I was summoned here as well, for thine arrival among our worlds has sparked some interest in our past dealings with thy kind. I've been instructed to speak to some groups here as a so-called expert on the subject."`
	"CN-17966" `	"Indeed. I'm ready to begin, then."`
	"CN-17967" `	"Good! We'd be wise to be prompt in our arrival t'our events."`
	"CN-17968" `	Sieasej brings you to a concierge of sorts, who eventually informs you that you should make your way to one of the smaller rooms branching off from the lobby. The doors open to reveal a garden-like area, filled with large long-leafed plants surrounding a centrally-located depression half-filled with water. Several Successors, many well-dressed like before, are gathered in the pool; you can't help but wince a little as the frigid water floods your boots.`
	"CN-17969" `	After a few minutes and other Successors have trickled in, the meeting begins in earnest. One of the Successors moves to the center of the pool and addresses you directly.`
	"CN-17970" `	"Captain. House Sioeora's supported thee with the gift of our device of tongues, and we continue t'recognize thy potential as an ally. We wish to further 'ppreciate the good that thou hast done upon our worlds, and we propose thou be awarded purchase rights for our petty technologies."`
	"CN-17971" `	That representative then returns to the outer rim of the circle and another takes the center, this time facing the representative who just spoke.`
	"CN-17972" `	"House Sioeora. House Chydiyi well sees thy perspicacity and, too, the value demonstrated by the captain, and so we support thy just proposal. The captain's proven themself t'be a benevolent traveler in our space, for whom we've every desire to make an ever more positive and useful element."`
	"CN-17973" `	A third representative now takes the center position, addressing the two previous speakers.`
	"CN-17974" `	"Noble Houses Sioeora and Chydiyi. House Kaatrij proposes this alien be given no further rights nor gifts until they have proved themself neutral. The Old Houses, which Sioeora and Chydiyi do today here represent, doth clearly seek to sway this alien's favor through brib'ry and deceit, t'exploit their lack of knowledge of our practices, and use them as they've already done to further their own interests in conflict with the common good."`
	"CN-17975" `	That representative then returns to the edge of the circle, where they continue to eye you with suspicion. There is a pause in the conversation.`
	"CN-17976" `	"I don't intend to take sides in your conflicts."`
	"CN-17977" `	"Guest-captain. House Kaatrij's before supported thee with the gift of our translation pin, and in return thou'st proved the foresight of this offer with thy public acts of help and industry. We wish to show such foresight once again, and so propose that thou be offered rights t'purchase our pettier technologies."`
	"CN-17978" `	"House Kaatrij. House Chydiyi well sees thy perspicacity and, too, the value demonstrated by the captain, and so we support thy just proposal. The captain's proven themself t'be a benevolent traveler in our space, for whom we've every desire to make an ever more positive and useful element."`
	"CN-17979" `	"Noble Houses Kaatrij and Chydiyi. House Sioeora proposes this alien be given no further rights nor gifts until they have proved themself a neutral party. The alien hath already forsaken a task and offer given by this House in favor of another: Kaatrij, whose ability to sway their favor through brib'ry and deceit is clear as ice. Should'st the alien be given purchase rights, their 'bility to offer wealth and power to such factions will be more formidable still. Sioeora shall stand strong and resolute t'opposing this nascent, rank corruption."`
	"CN-17980" `	This sparks some murmuring among the gathered Successors, both the representatives themselves and the other, quieter members who continue to stand around the periphery of the pool. There is no direct reply for some time until, after what seems like several minutes, the representative from House Kaatrij returns to the center and speaks.`
	"CN-17981" `	"Guest. House Kaatrij shall recognize thy noble words, even if we hold no reason for belief in them. We will permit the others to let thee buy our trinkets, and we shall watch thee closely to see if thy words are matched in action."`
	"CN-17982" `	With no further comments from any of the Successors, the representative from House Sioeora calls for a vote from among the gathered representatives. Sioeora and Chydiyi vote for the proposition and Kaatrij abstains from the vote, remaining at the rim of the pool, inspecting your behavior closely. The representative from Sioeora then promptly produces another small box from within their outfit and presents it to you. You open it to reveal one of the pin insignias that you have seen throughout this meeting.`
	"CN-17983" `	This sparks some murmuring among the gathered Successors, both the representatives themselves and the other, quieter members who continue to stand around the periphery of the pool. There is no direct reply for some time until, after what seems like several minutes, the representative from House Sioeora returns to the center and speaks.`
	"CN-17984" `	"Alien. House Sioeora hears well thy words, but must commit ourselves in opposition to this proposition for a gift. Thou surely can'st remain a neutral party while thy patron already seeks to honor thee before this council, t'offer boons that surely curry favor soon enough. Thy meager words make little difference."`
	"CN-17985" `	With no further comments from any of the Successors, the representative from House Kaatrij calls for a vote from among the gathered representatives. Kaatrij and Chydiyi vote for the proposition and Sioeora votes against it, remaining stationary at the rim of the pool. The representative from Kaatrij then promptly produces another small box from within their outfit and presents it to you. You open it to reveal one of the pin insignias that you have seen throughout this meeting.`
	"CN-17986" `	With no further comments from any of the Successors, the representative from House <successor patron> calls for a vote from among the gathered representatives. Unsurprisingly, <successor patron> and Chydiyi vote for the proposition and <successor opponent> votes against it, and the representative from <successor patron> promptly produces another small box from within their outfit and presents it to you. You open it to reveal one of the pin insignias that you have seen throughout this meeting.`
	"CN-17987" `	"'Tis is the mark of our diplomats and our symbol of trust and cooperation," they say. "Our people may remain wary of an alien in their midst, but wherever thou displays this, it shall be known thou hast received the blessing of the High Houses in our council and that they may trade with you in amity and without fear."`
	"CN-17988" `	With this, Chydiyi then leaves the room, followed by most of the other representatives and gathered members, the remainder of whom begin to mingle amongst themselves and chat; the meeting is apparently over.`
	"CN-17989" `	Outside, you run into Sieasej again, who has recently come back from a meeting of their own. "Well, captain, how went thy meeting in council? 'Twas fruitful, I hope?"`
	"CN-17990" `	"Yes, I was awarded technology purchase rights."`
	"CN-17991" `	"Yes, it was. How was yours?"`
	"CN-17992" `	"I, for one, am pleased to hear of this, captain. The Houses can be jealous with their favors, but in thy case I think they're wise for dispensing them more liberally. Ah," they say, interrupting themself, "would that I could stay, but yet my role here's still to finish and I've another meeting still to entertain. Fair travels, captain, and may we meet again." They splay their arms wide in the same gesture you've seen many times before and you offer a short bow in return.`
	"CN-17993" `	"I'm pleased to hear this, captain. I spoke at length about my research on thy words and his'try, as we know it. Ah, thy tongues are fascinating items and make for truly interesting sounds... 'Twas also that I entertained a number of questions about thee thyself! Some young archivist from Kaatrij, methinks? Truthfully, I sometimes confuse those New Houses with each other. Ah," they say, interrupting themself, "but yet my role here's still to finish and I've another meeting still to entertain. Fair travels, captain, and may we meet again." They splay their arms wide in the same gesture you've seen many times before and you offer a short bow in return.`
	"CN-17994" `	With your meeting resolved here, you head back to the monorail station and catch the next train back to the spaceport.`
	"CN-17995" `You watch for a couple of minutes as the spaceport crew here attempt to find a fuel adapter that fits your ship. After some time, a group of military officers is called over; they scan the side of the <ship> thoroughly and input their results into a datapad. Eventually the leader produces another one of the Successors' morphic metal spheres; they briefly connect it to the datapad and it rapidly squishes into a shape that lets it interface with both your ship and the fuel hose.`
	"CN-17996" `One of the Successors in the spaceport here seems to be offering small morsels of food to the others; short cooked strips of a dark green plant vaguely resembling a succulent, impaled on a wooden stick. Though most of the individuals here keep their distance from you, this one takes notice and offers you a stick.`
	"CN-17997" `	You take the stick from them and a wave of color runs up their body before they slither away to a different part of the spaceport.`
	"CN-17998" `	(Try a bite.)`
	"CN-17999" `	(Hide it away.)`
	"CN-18000" `	Though you only take a small bite, the food tastes vile enough for you to gag: it is tough and fishy and far too salty for your palate. You discreetly spit out what little you consumed and consider yourself lucky that you didn't have to pay anything for it.`
	"CN-18001" `	After a couple of seconds the Successor retracts their arm and slithers off to a different part of the spaceport.`
	"CN-18002" `	You hold the stick behind your back until you head back inside the <ship> and place it in a waste receptacle.`
	"CN-18003" `You've never seen a spaceport that's entirely underwater before. Next to your landing pad, there's a massive window into what you might call an aquarium but what seems to be some sort of lounge for the Successors, who swim around and organize themselves around several multi-layered tables.`
	"CN-18004" `Your ship draws a bit of a crowd when you land here, though most are kept at bay by a set of pre-arranged barriers set up around your landing pad and the occasional patrolling guard. While walking by the barrier, one Successor offers one of their data-spheres to you.`
	"CN-18005" `	The Successor trills warmly when you take the sphere, though they are quickly pushed back by one of the guards. Like previously, the sphere expands into a small star map as soon as you touch it, though this one seems to contain some cultural data in addition to stellar coordinates.`
	"CN-18006" `	You hold up your hands and step away from the individual offering you the data-sphere, and they are quickly pushed back by one of the guards.`
	"CN-18007" `Near to your landing pad in the spaceport here, you see a large circular pool with several Successors milling about in it. Some relax against the edges while others appear deep in conversation; one trio of individuals is followed by a small salamander-like animal that swims behind them and plays between and around their arms, making soft splashing noises as it jumps in and out of the water.`
	"CN-18008" `While waiting in the spaceport for the <ship> to be refueled, you notice that a small crowd of Successors is gathering around one of the pools of water that surround the starship hangars. Many are moving excitedly towards the commotion or, having already made it there, undulate strangely in the water.`
	"CN-18009" `	(Investigate the gathering.)`
	"CN-18010" `	You walk over the water-covered floor to the group, and as you start to grow closer, you begin to hear music coming from the pool: a strange, lilting melody, which is filled with notes that seem impossibly high or low or both at once. As you squeeze your way through the crowd, you see that in the pool there is a trio of submerged Successors, each of whom has their arms wrapped around one or several wildly distinct metal devices which protrude through the surface of the water. It is from these devices that the music emanates.`
	"CN-18011" `	One of the Successors in the pool begins to sing - at least, singing is the best way you could describe it; they press one of the longer and more cylindrical instruments up to their head and it begins producing an accompaniment to the other instruments' melody that your translation device occasionally recognizes as words:`
	"CN-18012" `	"... sweetest child... never want... not so... somber current... endure..."`
	"CN-18013" `	It is not clear whether or not this represents the entire lyric content of the performance or simply if the translation device is unable to parse the more tonal phrases. The submerged singer displays a variety of colors and textures on their skin, changing with each successive phrase; green and rough on a splittingly high note, pink and smooth-looking on a strangely growl-like low section. Several in the crowd emulate this in their own skin patterning; the group pulses in color and pattern in time with the melody of the music.`
	"CN-18014" `	(Continue listening.)`
	"CN-18015" `	The music eventually crescendos with a long, droning wail of instrumentation accompanied by a rapid, high-pitched vocal performance that sees the water in the pool sloshing from side to side as the trio within move rapturously, circling around each other faster and faster before suddenly stopping. The performance comes to a close with a gentler and more playful section that sees the performers blowing bubbles to the surface of the pool and producing short, semi-random notes on their bizarre instruments.`
	"CN-18016" `	The Successors around you produce a dull, low hum after the piece's conclusion.`
	"CN-18017" `	(Applaud.)`
	"CN-18018" `	(Try to hum myself.)`
	"CN-18019" `	The Successors around you seem a little surprised or perhaps confused by your display, but do not express any offense at it, as far as you can tell. The trio of performers eventually emerge from the pool, gently tucking their instruments into various equally oddly-shaped cases before chatting with some of the few remaining members of the crowd and then departing.`
	"CN-18020" `	The Successors around you seem amused by your attempt to emulate the humming; some briefly display a bluish-green wave of color across their skin before quickly returning to their base shade. Nonetheless, no one here seems to take any significant offense at the gesture. The performers eventually emerge from the pool, gently tucking their instruments into equally oddly-shaped cases before chatting with some of the few remaining members of the crowd and then departing.`
	"CN-18021" `	You return to your ship, gently extricating yourself from the throng of spellbound Successors, who continue to shimmer and sway in the distance until the performance eventually ends and they disperse to go their separate ways.`
	"CN-18022" `Shortly after you disembark the <ship> for the spaceport on <origin>, you hear a quiet but noticeable clattering from behind you near where your ship is being refueled.`
	"CN-18023" `	(Investigate the sound.)`
	"CN-18024" `	Upon approaching the source of the clattering, you catch a trio of Successors in the process of smearing the hull of the <ship> with globs of a colorful, foul-smelling solution. It is so pungent you can barely approach them without retching, but the Successors seem not to notice, or not to care.`
	"CN-18025" `	"What are you doing to my ship?"`
	"CN-18026" `	"Excuse me, are you all part of the repair crew?"`
	"CN-18027" `	The three Successors startle at the sound of your voice, arms whipping around as they turn to face you. One makes a move to run away, but one of the others clamps onto their arm and reels them back alongside them. All three slowly turn a shade of dull purple and their skin seems to contract over the underlying musculature. One of them eventually replies. "Yes, correct thou art! We've orders to apply this ... hull solution to repair a spot of damage here."`
	"CN-18028" `	Waves of color run up the bodies of the others, and the tips of their arms undulate gently.`
	"CN-18029" `	"I've never seen a solution like that before. How does it work?"`
	"CN-18030" `	"I'm sorry to interrupt in that case. Carry on."`
	"CN-18031" `	The three Successors startle at the sound of your voice, their arms whipping around as they turn to face you. One makes a move to run away, but one of the others clamps onto their arm and reels them back alongside them. All three slowly turn a shade of dull purple and their skin seems to contract over the underlying musculature. One of them eventually replies. "We... ah... we're part of the repair crew! We've orders to apply this... hull solution to repair a spot of damage here."`
	"CN-18032" `	The group look around at each other before the same one replies again. "The... ah... solution seeps into the cracks and strains within the hull and when it dries it seals them. Beyond that, we do not know; we just apply it as directed by the port authority."`
	"CN-18033" `	One of the other ones pipes up, cheerfully adding, "We don't know anything!" before the others give them a dark look.`
	"CN-18034" `	"And it's so colorful too! Are you sure it's not a paint of some sort?"`
	"CN-18035" `	"Fascinating. Carry on."`
	"CN-18036" `	"Oh, that's for... ah... safety. Yes, 'tis very dangerous to touch if thou'r'nt trained, so 'tis bright in color as a warning." None of the three are wearing any sort of protective equipment that you can see, and by now most of the group have changed color to what you might characterize as a mirthful shade of pink. This is something which one or two are clearly trying to suppress, their skin shifting in gradients in an effort to maintain their previous dull purple hue. One of the others is trying to hide a bag filled with more cans of "hull solution" behind their arms.`
	"CN-18037" `	"Well, if you're working on behalf of the port, then surely I can ask you to remove it as well."`
	"CN-18038" `	"Nice try, but you and I both know what's going on here."`
	"CN-18039" `	"I think my ship's hull has been well enough repaired. It might be best for you to attend to whatever other vessels are on your list."`
	"CN-18040" `	"Thanks for answering my questions. Please carry on."`
	"CN-18041" `	The trio seem rather deflated at hearing this, but after quite a bit of milling amongst themselves eventually relent and agree to remove the solution so long as you don't inform the port authority about their actions. While they put good effort into removing it - or at least act the part - they can't seem to scrub away the most dried-on parts, and you eventually let them go after it becomes apparent that some of the paint has permanently bonded to the hull.`
	"CN-18042" `	The trio brighten up at hearing this, and after some milling amongst themselves eventually glide off into the spaceport with their cans of solution in tow, though not before leaving one with you for "emergency repairs," though considering how terrible it smells it's not certain if you could ever stand trying to apply it.`
	"CN-18043" `	Upon returning from the spaceport some time later, you find that an area on the side of the <ship> has been covered in a thick, colorful solution with an incredibly noxious smell so potent you can hardly bear to approach it. The pattern forms some words in the Successor script, and while the translation device struggles to interpret the non-standard glyphs, it eventually offers a translation along the lines of "Ryiaa was here! And friends." The defacement takes several hours for the spaceport crews to sufficiently scour off, but a small degree of discoloration remains permanently bonded to the hull plating for the foreseeable future.`
	"CN-18044" `	Upon returning from the spaceport some time later, you find that the "repair crew" has covered an area on the side of the <ship> in their colorful and noxious solution. The pattern forms some words in the Successor script placed alongside a rather crude depiction of your face. The translation device struggles to interpret the non-standard glyphs, but it eventually resolves the text as "'Erjn'-Fool! No quills, no brain!" The defacement takes several hours for the spaceport crews to sufficiently scour off, but a small degree of discoloration remains permanently bonded to the hull plating for the foreseeable future.`
	"CN-18045" `Walking through the spaceport, you notice several posters have been put up to advertise some sort of performance, each one showing an outstretched Successor standing atop a brilliant blue sphere that swirls with octopoid forms. "Deathless Myiara," reads the title.`
	"CN-18046" `Walking through the spaceport, you notice several posters have been put up to advertise some sort of performance, each one showing an outstretched Successor standing atop a brilliant blue sphere that swirls with octopoid forms. "Deathless Myiara," reads the title, the last word echoing the name of this star system.`
	"CN-18047" `	As you look at the poster, a passing Successor takes notice and greets you, splaying their arms in the traditional manner. "The honored alien!" they say. "Doth the play arouse tonight thy interest? 'Tis a good company that puts it on."`
	"CN-18048" `	"Why not? Can you show me where it is?"`
	"CN-18049" `	"I'm not that interested in theater."`
	"CN-18050" `	"Thou wouldst surely be a well-treated guest," the Successor says. "Follow me, and we shan't be late."`
	"CN-18051" `	They lead you to one of the smaller transport gates at the spaceport, where a compact train snakes away from the city and into a remarkably pristine countryside. Eventually your guide leads you off the train; the station overlooks a large coastal depression where thousands of other Successors have gathered on semicircular benches around a central tank situated at the edge of the sea. Several of the benches have been built up into small but richly adorned boxes where, presumably, the wealthiest members of the audience can enjoy the show in privacy.`
	"CN-18052" `	You sit down, and after several minutes one Successor gives a brief introduction. It begins with thanking the local House for funding the event, continues into naming and introducing each of the lead actors, and finishes with a curious ritual in which each of the actors is given a small decorative token by the show's organizer. The actors thread these onto long strings that they carry - several of them already have highly-adorned strings that they loop several times over their bodies.`
	"CN-18053" `	"Myiara! How long we've been unseeing of thy tender face among our number! Return, and grace us so," cries a player within the tank, their voice amplified for the audience. Several others gyre around them, each wearing detailed, colorful masks, each one echoing "Myiara!" as the first speaker continues. Still more players enter from apertures in the tank's bottom, swimming up to the surface, where they pop into the air with acrobatic elegance before landing on the tank's clear top.`
	"CN-18054" `	"The Myiaran sort will never know their kind again," one says, their outfit and skin alike changing color to a rich blue. "For nobly we are not, nor never will..."`
	"CN-18055" `	(Pay attention.)`
	"CN-18056" `	(Let my mind wander.)`
	"CN-18057" `	(Leave early.)`
	"CN-18058" `	You stay until the first intermission - still an uncomfortably long wait, and as far as you can tell, the story is nowhere near complete at that point. The performance was distinctly alien, with masks, acrobatics, and a stunning moment midway through the first act where one of the characters conjured up a storm to afflict another. Huge globs of water, suspended in clear spheres, were lifted behind the stage by some sort of repulsor mechanism.`
	"CN-18059" `	The train silently arrives after only a few minutes of waiting and takes you back to the spaceport without issue.`
	"CN-18060" `	"Irja, go and spread thine arms! Listen for our heart's yearning call, their voice, if thine ears can but hear at all what little flutt'rings a mortal life doth make..."`
	"CN-18061" `	The play turns out to be remarkably long, and immensely complex. The plot follows both mortal Successors, on the dry stage, and the gods in the water beneath them. Myiara Raaja was the adoptive child of one of the gods, eternally youthful in their immortal realm, but who ran away to the mortal world while the gods slumbered. There, they lived a long and full life before eventually dying and leaving behind their only child, Myiara Sera. The awakened gods, lamenting the loss of their child, dispatch their messenger Irja to retrieve the elder Myiara from the world above, but Irja, blinded by joy, mistakes the younger Myiara Sera for Myiara Raaja. In a desperate show of wit, Myiara Sera manages to poison Irja with a draught of eternal sleep, smearing it on a fine cloak that the god cannot resist, thinking it to be a reunion gift from their long-lost child.`
	"CN-18062" `	To maintain their freedom, Myiara Sera descends into the immortal world, tearfully poisoning each of the gods one-by-one in a similar fashion, eventually leaving them as they began - slumbering, caught in the slow gyration of the undersea currents. By the epilogue, Myiara Sera has two children themself, one who remains forever with the gods, coaxing them into ever-deeper dreamful sleep, the other who lives on in the mortal world and gives rise to a family of heroes, each of whom have their own plays and other cultural products.`
	"CN-18063" `	"This one shall linger, unmaligned, insensate, in the sepulchre'f of the deep. And all the weeping masses 'bove, below shall in their memory keep, and render off'rings...`
	"CN-18064" `	The production of the performance is strikingly alien - each of the actors wears a complex mask of their character that articulates with their face beneath it. The masks of the mortal characters are straightforward, if expressive, but those of the gods are enormous and dramatic. Many have long, ribbony parts that never settle in the currents of the tank, constantly swirling around the heads of the actors.`
	"CN-18065" `	Characters jump between the mortal and immortal realms by acrobatic leaps between the water-filled tank and its mostly-dry top surface. When particular moments are meant to be highlighted, enormous splashes of water erupt from behind the stage, and during others, long strands of the writhing Successor metal rise from around it, forming forests, ocean waves, and terrible storms out of their gleaming lengths.`
	"CN-18066" `	"Myiara younger, elder, younger still, who each shakes us from our rest to let us feel it sour again in the oceans of our blood..."`
	"CN-18067" `	By the time it's over, you are thoroughly exhausted from the experience. The train arrives after only a few minutes of waiting and you, packed in along with many other Successors, make your way back to the spaceport, finally arriving late in the night.`
	"CN-18068" `	The play turns out to be remarkably long, and inscrutably complex. The plot seems to follow both mortal Successors, on the dry stage, and the gods in the water beneath them. One character named Myiara was beloved by the gods, and another one, seemingly misidentified, takes on the extensive process of one-by-one poisoning each of the gods so that their secret isn't found out. Eventually they have their own children, one of whom remains in the realm of the gods, and the other who returns to the world of the living.`
	"CN-18069" `	The production itself is eye-catching - the actors wear impressive masks that articulate with their faces, heightening the emotions they intend to portray. At particular moments in the story, enormous splashes of water erupt from behind the stage, and during others, long strands of metal are coaxed upwards into suspended shapes, forming scenes of storms and forests above the players' heads.`
	"CN-18070" `Soon after you disembark your ship, you spot two Successors eyeing you from across the spaceport; the younger one pulls at the arms of the larger one several times until eventually the two of them move over to you. The larger one splays their arms in greeting. "My child wanted me to ask of thee, alien - in thy travels, hast thou met a Sosrue?`
	"CN-18071" `	"Maybe, but I wouldn't know it by that name if I had."`
	"CN-18072" `	"I don't have time for this."`
	"CN-18073" `	The adult affects what might be a disappointed shade of red, but nonetheless collects their child and leaves you alone to your business.`
	"CN-18074" `	The child bursts into speech. "Beware the Sosrue, cloaked in black, its teeth and claws!" before their parent interrupts them.`
	"CN-18075" `	"I'm sorry," says the adult. "It's a monster, from a children's poem. This little's favorite. So tell my child and I, also - hast thou, among the wider breadth of stars, met some creature long of arm, discerning of ear, and many of tooth, that dwells in every manner of the stellar deep?" Their skin runs with thin golden lines as they say this, shivering with each syllable.`
	"CN-18076" `	"No, but I've met some interesting aliens."`
	"CN-18077" `	"I once wrestled one deep in a nebula."`
	"CN-18078" `	"That's an awfully dark story for a child."`
	"CN-18079" `	The child undulates gently, burbling with strange laughter. "'Tis not real," says their parent. "Why would my child be afeared by it?"`
	"CN-18080" `	With this, the two Successors glide back into the spaceport, chatting with each other as they go.`
	"CN-18081" `	The child wriggles gently as if laughing, turning a pastel shade of pink. "So serious, thou art," their parent says. "Perhaps thy alien companions did all the Sosrue-seeing before thou came. They must be witty ones to have escaped with their lives!"`
	"CN-18082" `	With this, the two depart back into the spaceport, clearly having fulfilled whatever impulse toward amusement they came to you for.`
	"CN-18083" `	"Thy wounds!" the child cries, "and by this, half thy arms have been divorced from thee!" They wiggle happily, and their parent continues, the golden lines from before bursting into splashes of color all over their body. "Thou must have been a witty one to have escaped this. No doubt thy foe remains in wait, now knowing of thy might. Thou must be twice as clever should you ever meet again!"`
	"CN-18084" `	With this final comment, the parent once again splays their arms to you and the two Successors glide back into the spaceport, the child murmuring more of the poem as they go.`
	"CN-18085" `Although the spaceport here is as quiet and lifeless as always, when you disembark for a moment, you spy a strange, colorful object lying a short distance away in the gloom. It's hard to tell what exactly it is at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it appears to be a small metal model of a Kvelqde shuttle, painted in bright and oily-looking colors. A tiny, well-worn propeller emerges from its rear.`
	"CN-18086" `	(Stomp on it.)`
	"CN-18087" `	The toy proves remarkably durable - your assault on it does little more than scuff its paint, while you are forced to limp back to the <ship> with a bruised foot.`
	"CN-18088" `	You return to your ship, catching one last glimpse of the improbable pinprick of color against the dark and foreboding station walls.`
	"CN-18089" `	You drop the toy shortly after picking it up when a sharp edge on the propeller slices through your hand. You hurry back to your ship while clutching the stinging wound.`
	"CN-18090" `A screen on one of the walls displays a commemorative message - a picture of a small salamander-like creature cradled in a Successor's arms, with some text below it:`
	"CN-18091" `	"Mirja-Mirja, the most loyal of friends and gentlest of animals. Such stuff as dreams are made on."`
	"CN-18092" `As you look around the spaceport here, a High Houses warship comes in for a landing, proceeding into a smaller outfitting bay off to the side that is only partially visible to civilian viewers. Enormous mechanical arms fold down from the top of the bay, first calibrating themselves against the vessel's shape and position before starting to scan over the warship's armor closely enough that it looks like they are almost touching. The metal writhes as the arms pass over it - goopy, liquid-looking protrusions form and collapse in their wake, splashing into themselves like raindrops into water, dewy and soft. Once the rippling stops, the texture of the hull looks somehow changed: a little rougher, perhaps, or maybe a slightly different shade of gray. The ship takes off not long after.`
	"CN-18093" `A proud-looking Successor naval officer stands before an imposing-looking warship: "Enlist!" the caption reads. "See the stars today!"`
	"CN-18094" `Several short vignettes play: a group of Successors unearthing ruins, the inside of a laboratory, a calm pastoral scene. A voiceover speaks: "Uncovering our heritage; bettering our lives." Meticulously-dressed officials of the High Houses are present in each situation, presented as supportive overseers.`

	"CN-18120" `As you land on the spaceport pad, you see a familiar face approaching; it is Sieasej, the Successor scholar who translated for you during your first contact with the Successors and assisted you during your mission for House Sioeora. They are moving towards you with a small group of similarly-dressed individuals, whom you assume are also scholars of some sort.`
	"CN-18121" `	"Captain! I delight to see thy return; I came here with haste as soon as I saw that thou was to arrive!"`
	"CN-18122" `	You greet Sieasej, and they explain that the scholars with them are researchers of the Predecessors seeking transport on a wormhole-traveling vessel.`
	"CN-18123" `	"The ship modifications necessary are woefully expensive," one of the researchers continues. "Were we to petition Sioeora and the Academy to offer us a properly-equipped vessel, we might be forced to wait for years, a pace that's far too slow for our research. If thou were't to transport us instead, even for a short time, it would advance our study greatly."`
	"CN-18124" `	"Sure, I would be happy to."`
	"CN-18125" `	"Can I come back another time?"`
	"CN-18126" `	"Sorry, but you'll have to find someone else to take you."`
	"CN-18127" `	"Hm, probably. We've been patient enough for this long, though I encourage thee to seek us out again with haste."`
	"CN-18128" `	"Our deepest thanks!" Several of the members of the research team smile conspiratorially, clearly excited to be skipping the queue. Sieasej also offers their thanks and makes clear that they'll "keep an eye out for any more interesting opportunities."`
	"CN-18129" `	You realize that the Predecessor research team from House Sioeora is probably still waiting to see if you can transport them to <planet stopovers>. Would you like to contact them?`
	"CN-18130" `	You manage to get in contact with the head of the research group, who is quite excited to hear that you finally have the opportunity to transport them and their team. After about an hour of waiting in the spaceport, the researchers arrive to meet you, and you eventually manage to get them loaded onto your ship and ready for departure.`
	"CN-18131" `While relatively calm and subdued during the journey here, the researchers bolt out of the airlock almost the instant your ship's landing gear touch the ground, their arms loaded down with an innumerable array of booklets, catalogs, and strange devices that they waste no time in thrusting into the air or towards the rocks and soil.`
	"CN-18132" `	As night begins to fall on the planet, the researchers reluctantly return to your ship, dusty and tired but abuzz with excitement at their discoveries.`
	"CN-18133" `	As you are making preparations to leave, you realize this would be a good moment to learn about the Predecessors from the experts, especially considering you're liable to be listening to them talk about their new data all the way back.`
	"CN-18134" `	"What can you tell me about the Predecessors?"`
	"CN-18135" `	(Don't ask them anything.)`
	"CN-18136" `	"Who were the Predecessors?"`
	"CN-18137" `	"Actually, I didn't have any questions after all."`
	"CN-18138" `	"What caused the collapse?"`
	"CN-18139" `	"How large was their empire?"`
	"CN-18140" `	"What was their technology like?"`
	"CN-18141" `	"Our Predecessors were our now-gone ancestors. Until the time of fifteen hundred years ago, they ruled this space and much beyond as part of their own empire. Many perished along with their bloodlines as much of the empire fell to ruin, but some made passage through the wormhole to the cluster that we, as their Successors, now call our home."`
	"CN-18142" `	The researcher sighs. "We do not know; or better put, the fullness of the truth yet remains obscured. The flesh of space itself was rent, distorted; the effects of this remain today: the holes embedded in the skies, the dying-out of light and even of the hyperlanes. It was a warring time; the Houses turned upon each other or they fled, and space itself was set alight with the blinks of shots and drives..."`
	"CN-18143" `	The researcher stops for a moment, composing themself.`
	"CN-18144" `	"I digress and do apologize. 'Tis challenging to separate the truth from fiction in this regard. Our Predecessors wielded power far beyond our modern imitations, the sort that sows the seeds of peace or chaos deep within the fabric of the world, the sort of things that poke and prod at places that must remain untouched. 'What caused the collapse?' you ask? Hubris, methinks."`
	"CN-18145" `	"The translation device thou wears upon thy person speaks volumes to its scale. Sieasej tells me that at the empire's peak, our scholars had even laid eyes upon thine own world, so far to the north! These dead systems that remain where once the core of their empire stood are but a small fraction of what was there. Some, it's sure, now belong to other races, and others, it would seem, have been obscured. We know not how nor why, only that the starcharts of our Predecessors do not mirror those we see today."`
	"CN-18146" `	"Glorious and beautiful, it was; as much a sort of art as of engineering. Our Predecessors' works were envied even by the Quarg, whose mastery of art and science only few may equal. T'were exotic in their natures and unique in applications; living metal grown in stars, subtle points to pierce space itself. We have descriptions, enough to make rudimentary imitations of their processes, but even if we had a perfect understanding of wha'twas, the space of our new systems seems unsuitable to manifest that mastery. We fail even to replicate the heirlooms kept by the High Houses; the materials and techniques they use are always out of reach."`
	"CN-18147" `	You leave the researchers to study their findings.`
	"CN-18148" `As expected, the scholars remained highly conversational on the way back, remarking on unusual radiation measurements and fawning over several small metal fragments collected by one particularly lucky member of the team.`
	"CN-18149" `	They almost forget to give you your payment when you return them to <destination>, but the head researcher places a chip for <payment> into your hands and thanks you before departing into the spaceport.`
	"CN-18150" `While you are sitting in the spaceport, you are approached by a Successor wearing a curious green outfit and carrying several pieces of seemingly high-tech equipment, enough that it appears close to falling out of their arms. They explain that they are a Successor biologist who had chartered a flight to go and examine the primordial life on <planet stopovers>, a young and still-developing planet, but that their pilot had been detained, leaving them stranded here.`
	"CN-18151" `	"If thou coulds't provide travel to that planet, I may still be able to gather my data before my period of research leave expires."`
	"CN-18152" `	"Thou has my deep and certain thanks. Tell none, but the High Houses are beastly to us academics." The biologist, who introduces themselves as "Kaatiora," loads their collection of equipment into your ship - though not without almost dropping one particularly fragile-looking item - and is eventually ready to leave.`
	"CN-18153" `On the way here, Kaatiora has been impressively inquisitive, continually asking you questions about human biology with a level of verve and excitement you had previously thought impossible. Once they exhausted your knowledge of every detail of human biology, they moved on without hesitation to every other Earth-related species they knew of from Predecessor records, from cattle to frogs to far more exotic ones that you've never heard of in your life but apparently are all the rage among the circles of Successor xenobiology.`
	"CN-18154" `	It is somewhat relieving when you finally arrive at the planet and Kaatiora momentarily departs, once again carrying their more-than-armful of equipment and excitedly but carefully scanning the volcanic hot-water pools and small lakes around your landing site, occasionally exclaiming with excitement.`
	"CN-18155" `	Eventually they return to your ship, satisfied with the amount of data they have collected, but still obviously energized by the experience.`
	"CN-18156" `	Before leaving, you realize this would be a good time to learn more about the Successors from an expert. Besides, since you spent the majority of the time on the way here answering Kaatiora's questions, you are probably entitled to ask a few of your own.`
	"CN-18157" `	(Ask about Successor biology.)`
	"CN-18158" `	(Don't ask anything.)`
	"CN-18159" `	As expected, Kaatiora is more than happy to share their biological knowledge, and asks if there is anything in particular you'd like to know about.`
	"CN-18160" `	"What can you tell me about the Successors?"`
	"CN-18161" `	"Were the Predecessors any different from the present Successors, biologically speaking?"`
	"CN-18162" `	"What is the life in this star cluster like?"`
	"CN-18163" `	"Much of our evolutionary history, we spent beneath the waves of our home planet, and while now you clearly see we breathe the same air as you, we still retain our cold and water-loving tendencies. Our respiration works just as well submerged as on dry land, though we must retain some degree of moisture on our skin.`
	"CN-18164" `	"Apart from that, we are a hermaphroditic species, like most from our home planet, and as we took to the stars, we learned that this is uncommon but not rare, and so there is some curiosity as to why our planet had such a diversity of such species while most do not. Perhaps, since we grew up under a harsh sun, the redundancy provided by our divorce from biological sex was beneficial to our evolution.`
	"CN-18165" `	"And of course, thou hast surely noticed by now the natural camouflage of our skin. While today its use is for communication, it was long ago a useful tool for evading predators who hunted by sight, until, of course, we gained the wisdom to outsmart our predators rather than hide from them."`
	"CN-18166" `	"As brevity is the soul of wit, then no, our Predecessors did not differ greatly from us in their core biology. A scion of the High Houses from the time of the collapse would not stand out from the average one of us in the present day. That being said, their understanding of it was much superior: their medical science was much more advanced than our own, and much of their technology was genetically coded to function only for specific families."`
	"CN-18167" `	"Thou asks at a fortuitous time! This planet, and the life that lives upon it, may provide to us a better answer to that question. Many of the stars here are hot and young and therefore harsh to nascent life, and yet thou hast surely seen the verdant worlds that orbit them! While some of this results from early settlement during the old empire, much of it does not and therefore remains a vexing point. How could life develop here? If we can track the path taken by the life of this planet, we may find the answer both you and I seek."`
	"CN-18168" `	You leave Katiiora to their business and make your preparations to take off when ready.`
	"CN-18169" `	Kaatiora remains excited and talkative on the way back, though marginally less so now that they have exhausted the totality of your knowledge of the biological sciences and have the analysis of their recently-gathered data to occupy them.`
	"CN-18170" `	Upon landing at <destination>, they disembark from your ship, once again carrying their excess of equipment, but not before giving you your payment of <payment> and once again offering their thanks for transporting them.`
	"CN-18171" `While in the spaceport on <origin>, you notice a pair of tired-looking Successors lugging around a cart of a curious folded material, taking turns dragging their apparently heavy luggage over the floor. Both perk up substantially when they see you and your ship, however, and pull their equipment towards you with renewed vigor, finally getting close enough to speak.`
	"CN-18172" `	The larger of the two begins, "Oh! Thour't that recent alien, no? 'Tis a gorgeous ship thou commands-"`
	"CN-18173" `	"What we meant to say is-"`
	"CN-18174" `	"Sorry, 'tis just that-" `
	"CN-18175" `	"Do you take passenger missions?"`
	"CN-18176" `	"It depends for what purpose."`
	"CN-18177" `	One of the Successors looks what you might call embarrassed, flushing a dull green. The other replies.`
	"CN-18178" `	"Stargazing. There is a world at the edge of the galaxy, the farthest edge; it has the most beautiful view-"`
	"CN-18179" `	"We've brought our own equipment."`
	"CN-18180" `	"The sky there's divided into star-studded night and utter void. Could thou take us there?"`
	"CN-18181" `	"And back, of course. And our cargo," the other one says, gesturing towards the cart of folded fabric.`
	"CN-18182" `	"And back. And our cargo. We can give thee modest pay."`
	"CN-18183" `	"You'll have to find a different pilot."`
	"CN-18184" `	"Oh! 'Tis perfect! We were looking for a private transport. We're stargazers-"`
	"CN-18185" `	"There's a planet at the edge of the galaxy with the perfect view-"`
	"CN-18186" `	"And back, of course. And our cargo too," the other one says, gesturing towards the cart of folded fabric.`
	"CN-18187" `	"I'm sorry, but you'll have to find a different pilot."`
	"CN-18188" `	The two seem thrilled, the larger one turning a dull pink. "Oh! Thour't truly honorable, noble alien. I am Nnesa."`
	"CN-18189" `	"Jaasora. Thank you, Captain. Most pilots here've no appetite to travel to the uninhabited systems."`
	"CN-18190" `	"Yes, you must tell us about all the places you've been-"`
	"CN-18191" `	"How about we get you onboard first."`
	"CN-18192" `	Nnesa flashes with embarrassment once again, but Jaasora offers a supportive arm, wrapping it around their body. The two enlist your help in loading their cart of equipment, which is much heavier than it looks, but together the three of you eventually manage to maneuver their luggage into the <ship>'s cargo bay and are ready for departure.`
	"CN-18193" `Nnesa and Jaasora have been simply enthralled on the journey here; the inseparable pair has spent seemingly every waking moment peering out the <ship>'s windows to watch the stars stream past. Upon arrival in the Maspa-Mavra system, however, their excitement dwindled to what you would call a subdued awe at the sight of the entire galaxy splayed out in the sky.`
	"CN-18194" `	Khosa-Kella-Oa itself is cold, dark and rocky: for all purposes functionally identical to any of the other innumerable uninhabited airless worlds in the galaxy. Your passengers seem pleased with it, though; Nnesa remarks that the local star "is so dim that there's hardly any glare!" and Jaasora energetically agrees. They activate their cart of folded equipment within the <ship>'s cargo bay, which slowly inflates and unfolds into something halfway between a tent and a repulsor lift. It skids over the floor like melting ice, gently bumping the inside walls a couple times before Jaasora manages to quiet its movement.`
	"CN-18195" `	"Our thanks again, captain, for transporting us," says Jaasora as they load a bundle of telescopes inside.`
	"CN-18196" `	"Oh! The planet's perfect; no air to muddy the view nor other ships to cloud the skies-"`
	"CN-18197" `	"We should be back in a couple hours. Please wait for us."`
	"CN-18198" `	The pair depart in their gliding tent, which manifests several transparent spots on its surface as it exits and as a bevy of telescopes are prodded around inside.`
	"CN-18199" `	Nnesa and Jaasora return after a couple of hours as promised, their strange tent gliding back into the <ship>'s cargo bay as smoothly as it exited. The pair unload several notebooks of photos and drawings and chatter excitedly about the various constellations and stellar phenomena that they observed. Nnesa is particularly excited, hurriedly extracting from the interleaved mess of papers a surprisingly accurate and well-constructed star map, which they press up in your face with pride. You cannot help but notice that several of the drawings in the stack are of Jaasora rather than of any stellar phenomena.`
	"CN-18200" `	"From where on the map dost thou hail, captain?" Nnesa roughly gestures to an area of their map that you recognize as human space.`
	"CN-18201" `	(Indicate Rutilicus.)`
	"CN-18202" `	(Indicate Sol.)`
	"CN-18203" `	(Indicate Fah Soom.)`
	"CN-18204" `	(Gesture broadly to the expanse of space depicted on the map.)`
	"CN-18205" `	"Oh!" says Nnesa, "Thou art a scion of the constellations, first and foremost to the stars? 'Tis fair. Thou hast a galaxy to wander, a nearly endless sky. The things that there must be to see-"`
	"CN-18206" `	"Oh!" says Nnesa, "I am not sure I know the name for that one, captain. What dost thou call thy home?"`
	"CN-18207" `	"Rutilicus."`
	"CN-18208" `	"Oh!" says Nnesa, "Sol." They quietly sound their way through the word a couple times, trying to get it right. "Our name for it is Saaqa-Viirja. 'Twas one of the northernmost extents of our Predecessors' voyages. Ah. But thou know'st this already, for sure."`
	"CN-18209" `	"Oh!" says Nnesa. "That far to the north? Thy kind must have spread far for thee to have such a place as thy home. What dost thou call it?"`
	"CN-18210" `	"Fah Soom."`
	"CN-18211" `	Nnesa asks you to repeat the word a second time, slowly working their way through your pronunciation and transcribing a short sequence of flowing letters on their map. "'Tis a pleasant name," they say.`
	"CN-18212" `	The two of you are interrupted by Jaasora, who needs Nnesa's help to pack the now-deflating tent back in its cart, and once that is done they indicate that they are ready to return home.`
	"CN-18213" `Nnesa and Jaasora have continued to marvel at the stars on the way back home, in addition to spending a substantial amount of time poring over their mutual collection of photos, drawings, and maps from Maspa-Mavra. "Our deepest thanks, captain," Jaasora says to you once you have landed in the spaceport as Nnesa wrestles with the tent and cart. "'Twas a true and joyful voyage." Nnesa calls them over; the tent clearly requires at least two to handle. Jaasora presents you with your payment of <payment> and goes to help, and the two of them maneuver their equipment out of your cargo bay before shouting a hasty but good-humored farewell.`
	"CN-18214" `Compared to most of the spaceports you have been to in Successor space, this one is dingy, crowded, and uncomfortable. Most of the Successors you see look equally dirty and unhappy, and the majority of the few ships you've noticed landing are painted in a different, darker shade of red.`
	"CN-18215" `	Would you like to ask someone here about this place?`
	"CN-18216" `	You approach one of the crew members disembarking from one of the red-painted ships, which, as you draw closer, you see bears several large burns and scars.`
	"CN-18217" `	"Excuse me, I was wondering if you could tell me about this place. It seems different to the rest of Successor space I've been through."`
	"CN-18218" `	The Successor looks over at the spaceport for a moment before grunting quietly and deciding to reply. Their voice is lower and darker than that of most Successors you have heard, and their skin changes color and texture rapidly, almost with every word.`
	"CN-18219" `	"Thou art the alien vis'tor brought by the Old Houses, art thou not? Their 'noble guest' whom they parade around with such delight?"`
	"CN-18220" `	"Thou art the alien vis'tor paraded 'round between the Houses, art thou not? Their 'noble guest' or 'flighty knave' that depends on t'which thee speaks?`
	"CN-18221" `	"You could say so."`
	"CN-18222" `	Despite the accusation of being "paraded around," the Successor grunts again at your response; with approval or disgust you cannot tell. They lean against one of the cargo containers on the spaceport floor and continue.`
	"CN-18223" `	"So then thou art another indolent fool, no doubt deceived by their fine promises, of wealth and power so long as you toe the line? Well, look around and see the value of their noble word! The Houses care but naught for you or I or any of them." The Successor gestures to the crowd in a broad sweeping motion.`
	"CN-18224" `	"I don't think of myself as a fool."`
	"CN-18225" `	"Then thou art doubly so, because thy time within this space is new and short and so the thoughts contained within thy brain are like those of a child, still blind to the world. But keep thy friends if they appear so kind; and take the time to recollect what I have said when in thy back their dagger nests."`
	"CN-18226" `	With that, the Successor leaves, rising from the cargo containers and heading silently towards the spaceport.`
	"CN-18227" `	"They are the outcasts of the Houses New, who, like the rest, were forced here when the old empire crumbled into ash. But while the rest of the New Houses had ample wealth to move and grow into their new domains, not all of us were able to escape this intermediary place they shoved us into while we waited. A thousand years and still they paint us with their scorn and demonize our yearning to be free."`
	"CN-18228" `	"Free?"`
	"CN-18229" `	"Thank you. I have no more questions."`
	"CN-18230" `	"Thou would be wise, if thou possesses that rare art, to keep and guard thy back against thy new and treacherous 'friends.'`
	"CN-18231" `	"Or don't. Another buried fool makes little difference."`
	"CN-18232" `	"Free, or freer than Old and New permit. The People's Houses stand not for the rich and those of noble blood, but for the true and honest heirs of that which was."`
	"CN-18233" `	The Successor looks over to the spaceport, before returning their attention to you for the last time.`
	"CN-18234" `You notice after landing here that the spaceport crew is making no effort to refuel or repair your ship, and that a large contingent of Successor military officers is gathering around your landing pad, their weapons trained on your vessel. As several interceptors begin to hover over your ship as well with their weapons ready, you are forced to take off.`
	"CN-18235" `You notice after landing here that the spaceport crew is making no effort to refuel or repair your ship, and that a large contingent of Successor military officers is gathering around your landing pad.`
	"CN-18236" `	You soon receive a transmission routed through the local spaceport. "Thy recent actions against our people make it very clear that we were unwise to permit thee access to our space. The Houses have decreed in council that thou art an enemy, and thou shalt be treated accordingly hereforth."`
	"CN-18237" `	"I apologize for the transgression. I won't do it again."`
	"CN-18238" `	"They deserved it."`
	"CN-18239" `Shortly after landing here, you receive a long-range transmission from the Successors. Though you can't make sense of any of the words, you get the distinct impression that they are angry at you.`
	"CN-18240" `Shortly after landing here, you receive a long-range transmission from the Successors. "Thy recent actions against our people make it very clear that we were unwise to permit thee access to our space. The Houses have decreed in council that thou art an enemy, and thou shalt be treated accordingly hereforth."`
	"CN-18241" `	Spots of flaming orange appear over the Successor's skin. "Any creature prone to such 'accidents' has no place among our worlds." They end the transmission there.`
	"CN-18242" `	The Successor flashes a dark red. "Our fleets will make sure of it." They end the transmission there.`
	"CN-18243" `	A wave of bristling black runs over the Successor's body before they end the transmission.`
	"CN-18244" `	Your landing permission is revoked and the contingent of officers train their weapons on your ship. As several interceptors begin to hover over your landing pad, weapons ready, you are forced to take off.`
	"CN-18245" `"red gold" armlets`
	"CN-18246" `"red gold" piercings`
	"CN-18247" `The Mereti have clearly been expanding their greenhouses since you last visited this world. A few smaller drones gather around as your ship comes in to land, and they welcome you as you step out.`
	"CN-18248" `	Then, without giving you time to properly respond, they shepherd you into one particular greenhouse, slightly larger than the others. Within, a single plant sits in a majestic pot in the center, illuminated by a shaft of light through the windows above. It is small, with vibrant deep blue petals and teal leaves, and despite your lack of familiarity with it you can tell that it is not growing well.`
	"CN-18249" `	One of the drones speaks to you, much more quietly than the last time you spoke with them. "You are our friend. You helped to [defend, protect] us when we were attacked. You brought our [parents? ancestors?] to us. Please, help us again."`
	"CN-18250" `	The drone speaks again. "This plant is important to us. It is our..." The drone pauses for a few seconds, and lights flash across it. "It is important to us. Our [teachers, mentors] say it is not [native, local] to this world, and cannot survive here." As it says this, two Wanderers walk in accompanied by another Mereti drone, talking with each other in hushed tones. They look up when the drone you are speaking with mentions them, and quickly approach you.`
	"CN-18251" `	"Can you help them?"`
	"CN-18252" `	One of the Wanderers speaks up. "This plant... it shares crucial similarities with some of the plants that we [grow, tend] on <planet>, so let us bring it there for now. There will be [differences, complications], but that is the [best, most likely] [approach, solution] in the short term. But we still seek to leave these worlds to the Unfettered, and so we cannot [house, cultivate] this plant there forever."`
	"CN-18253" `	The drones, which have been silently listening to the two Wanderers, carefully pick up the pot containing the plant, and fly back in the direction of your ship, followed by the two Wanderers. You follow them back and prepare to set off for <planet>.`
	"CN-18254" `The Mereti ships following you caused some alarm among the local population as you came in to land, particularly with the spaceport's traffic control, who are unaccustomed to the way they hurtle by less than a meter from the Wanderers' ships at almost top speed on their way down.`
	"CN-18255" `	Your passengers exit your ship almost immediately after you land, and the spaceport workers carefully unload the plant from your cargo hold. "Meet us in the spaceport and we will inform you of our next [plans, steps]."`
	"CN-18256" `The two Wanderers from earlier are waiting for you in the spaceport, but this time another Wanderer is with them. She introduces herself as Keti Va'ika, a specialist in xenobotany. The other two leave as she starts explaining the situation.`
	"CN-18257" `	"We have [restored, healed] the plant, and it is surviving here for now, but we will soon be moving out of these systems. This plant [originates, belongs] in Korath space, so we must find a way to return it there."`
	"CN-18258" `	Va'ika pauses and thinks for a moment before continuing. "The Korath do not seem to me to be the type to [create, engineer] such a flower through [artificial, unnatural] means. I suspect it originates on one of their worlds. If we are fortunate, it may [grow, prosper] there still. From an initial look, we [believe, suspect] that it is native to either <planet>, Sopi Lefarkata, or possibly one of those worlds that is so [damaged, destroyed] that it is difficult to [see, imagine] what it might once have been like."`
	"CN-18259" `	"You really are set on giving these worlds to the Unfettered, then?"`
	"CN-18260" `	"What do you suggest we do?"`
	"CN-18261" `	Va'ika responds sharply. "That is our [purpose, way]. We heal worlds, and then we turn them over to other species. We would not [imagine, consider] any other course of action."`
	"CN-18262" `	Va'ika points at a map, marking out the <system> system. "Let us [search, visit] <planet> first. It is near to the worlds of the Mereti and not in the [territory, region] of their [rivals, foes], so it seems more likely that this plant [originated, grew] there."`
	"CN-18263" `Va'ika guides you to an area of high, cool steppes as you approach. You find a suitable place to land your ship, and she steps out. The air that blows in through the open door stings your eyes, but Va'ika seems too deep in thought to notice. "It would have [grown, originated] here, I am certain of it. But it will do so no longer, not for many [years, cycles]." Va'ika bows her head and holds one wing in front of herself silently for a moment before continuing. "We must find some world with similar [regions, environments] that we can introduce it to. Perhaps we will have better luck on Sopi Lefarkata."`
	"CN-18264" `This time, Va'ika guides you down into an equatorial lowland - a dry, grassy plain over which a cool wind blows. You can feel its similarity to the steppe you visited on Solima Skarati, but this time you can breathe freely, without the air stinging your eyes and mouth. Va'ika takes some soil and places it in a small device, looking at it for a moment before turning to you. "Here. It will [grow, prosper] here."`
	"CN-18265" `	"Is there anything else I can do to help?"`
	"CN-18266" `	"How can you be so sure?"`
	"CN-18267" `	"We have already collected significant data on the climate of this world. The only question I needed to answer in person was whether the [composition, nature] of the soil was suitable."`
	"CN-18268" `	"Let us return to Vara Kehi'ki. We will send a small detachment of [healers, gardeners] to <planet>, to ensure that these plants become established. In the long term, we will return them to <origin> when it is healed."`
	"CN-18269" `You arrive in the spaceport just in time to see the plant being delicately loaded onto a Strong Wind. The Mereti drones sit stationary on the landing pad, and you get a distinct feeling that they are watching you intently.`
	"CN-18270" `	Va'ika stands beside you as you watch, staring into the distance almost morosely, before speaking. "It is regrettable that we have been [forced, made] to use these ships for war. This is far closer to the purpose we originally [conceived, designed] them to [serve, fulfill]." You catch a glimpse of a feather falling to the ground as she speaks. Then, she interrupts herself. "No, I should not be so [disheartened?]. The Korath drones have turned their back on their creators' [wishes, design] and seek to [heal, tend] these worlds alongside us. That is something we can all appreciate."`
	"CN-18271" `	"Are you sure this will work?"`
	"CN-18272" `	Va'ika straightens up, and speaks with clear confidence. "It is a [fortunate, convenient] situation. <planet> needs relatively little healing, so [housing, growing] these plants here will not create [difficulties, inconveniences] for our work. We have sent a small specialist [group, team] to [cultivate, look after] the plants. I have the utmost confidence in their [knowledge, abilities]."`
	"CN-18273" `The Mereti drones follow you and the <npc> down to the planet, landing nearby. You and Va'ika watch as the plant is carefully, almost ceremoniously, taken and placed in the ground.`
	"CN-18274" `	After the plant has been suitably placed, Va'ika turns to you. "I will stay here for some time to [supervise, observe] the work, but it will soon be time for me to [depart, return] and oversee the healing of other worlds. I thank you most [gratefully, sincerely] for your help, <first>."`
	"CN-18275" `As you approach <planet>, you recall that this is the planet on which you and the Wanderers planted the flower that the Mereti gave you. As you descend through the clouds, you spot a tiny blue dot in the depths of a valley, exactly where you left the Wanderers years ago.`
	"CN-18276" `	The spot grows larger as you get closer, until you see the Strong Wind parked in the middle of a field of flowers, their petals gleaming a beautiful deep blue.`
	"CN-18277" `	You carefully set your ship down outside the field, and a small Mereti drone flies up to you, speaking in a voice that is far more subdued than you expect. "Thank you, <first> <last>. You have [saved, restored] the sitrasanir." Your translator makes no attempt at the last word, and it doesn't sound like any word you have heard in either the Hai or Wanderer language.`
	"CN-18278" `	"Sitrasanir?"`
	"CN-18279" `	"This flower is called the sitrasanir. Its [symbol, appearance] was of [importance, significance] to our creators when they were [present? alive?]. We [abandoned, ignored] it for years, but our [parents, ancestors] helped us to remember it."`
	"CN-18280" `	The drone sits in a contemplative silence, looking out into the field. The sun rises higher into the sky, and the field shines in blue hues that almost exactly match the blue paints on the Mereti ships in the sky above.`
	"CN-18281" `With the Eye fully opened, Wanderer ships have begun flooding into this region of space. This desolate planet seems to be of particular interest to them, with drones rapidly surveying in all directions, and a small outpost beginning to form.`
	"CN-18282" `	As you land on the outskirts of this settlement, one of the workers comes up to you as you leave your ship. "[Greetings, welcome], it is [delightful, pleasing] to see you have come to show your interest in our exploration. Unfortunately, there exists much [hazard, risk] on a world we know so little about. This will be our staging ground to [explore, catalog] this new region, but it will take some time to be assured of the [safety, security] of our outpost. I suggest you take time to [orient, locate] yourself in these systems while we set up before returning to help. Of course you are welcome when we have [determined, established] safety, there will be many ships needed to help heal the many ruined planets here."`
	"CN-18283" `The Wanderers have begun building a base here, with freighters landing every few minutes to bring more supplies or people. They have a fair number of weapons and warships to keep the Korath automata at bay, but the majority of the supplies look like scientific tools or possibly equipment for terraforming planets.`
	"CN-18284" `	Soon after you land, you are ushered in to a meeting with several of the senior Wanderer leaders. You recognize the military commander Sobari Tele'ek, but the others are strangers to you. And oddly, in addition to the adults there is a Wanderer child in the meeting, barely more than a meter tall, with iridescent black plumage like a starling.`
	"CN-18285" `	When she sees you the child says, "Greetings, Captain." Surprisingly, she speaks in your own language. It's heartening that the Wanderers are teaching your language to their children; perhaps in a few years you'll no longer need the translation device to talk with them.`
	"CN-18286" `	Tele'ek asks you, "Have you explored this new [territory, responsibility] that the Eye has brought us to?"`
	"CN-18287" `	"Yes, it looks like the worlds here are in great need of your care."`
	"CN-18288" `	"I've run into hostile robotic drones here. You may have been safer back where you came from."`
	"CN-18289" `	"No, I have not had time to explore yet."`
	"CN-18290" `	"Indeed," says one of the other Wanderers. "It is very [exciting, stimulating]."`
	"CN-18291" `	"Perhaps," says Tele'ek, "but we have not yet found a way to [communicate, reason] with them. Perhaps their attacks on us are merely a misunderstanding."`
	"CN-18292" `	A different Wanderer speaks up and says, "This new territory is full of [promise, possibility], but we are few in number still and have not dared to [explore, survey] too widely. Human, you have [special, exotic] means of travel and can perhaps explore more [safely? circumspectly?] than we can. Will you visit some worlds for us and help us to [measure, discern] what must be done to heal them?"`
	"CN-18293" `	"Are you sure you aren't in danger here from the Korath drones?"`
	"CN-18294" `	"Don't worry," says Tele'ek. "[Resisting, fighting] the Unfettered Hai forced us to develop stronger warships. We are well [equipped, prepared] for this new threat."`
	"CN-18295" `	The Wanderers load a large amount of scientific equipment onto your ship and explain how to use it. They also indicate several planets that their long-range sensors have detected that they would like you to investigate further.`
	"CN-18296" `When you land, a Wanderer named Tema'a Iriket meets you, and identifies herself as the head of the terraforming team. She is excited to see your data on the nearby planets. "For each of these worlds," she says, "we must decide what [treatment, strategy] will best enable it to flourish once more. Even if a world is near to the [territory, domain] of the [dangerous, hostile] robots, we may be able to begin its [healing, transformation] from a distance."`
	"CN-18297" `	"I'm surprised your species is so eager to start terraforming. I'd think the threat of the Korath automata would be your first priority."`
	"CN-18298" `	"Is there any way I can help with the terraforming efforts?"`
	"CN-18299" `	She says, "[Healing, renewing] worlds is something we love doing. Fighting is not something we love. So unless the robots become more [aggressive, threatening] we prefer not to seek out conflict. And in the meantime, it would be [intriguing, exciting] to make measurements on the planets they control. Could you do that for us?"`
	"CN-18300" `	"I am [pleased, delighted] that you asked," she says. "What we would find most [useful, interesting] right now would be [climate? ecosystem?] measurements from the planets orbiting these stars." On a local star map, she points out several star systems.`
	"CN-18301" `	"Those are deep in Kor Mereti territory," you tell her.`
	"CN-18302" `	"Yes," she says, "which is why I am [hoping, presuming] to ask you to make the measurements."`
	"CN-18303" `	"Sure, I would be glad to do that."`
	"CN-18304" `	"That sounds awfully dangerous."`
	"CN-18305" `	"Excellent," she says. "I will collect the data from you when you are done."`
	"CN-18306" `	"I have complete [trust, faith] in your abilities," she says, and then she walks away before you can protest further.`
	"CN-18307" `	When you report to the Wanderer leaders, they have several other requests for you. A cosmologist named Erukt Isi'ithi is interested in scanner data on three supernova remnants near Korath space. And Sobari Tele'ek wants you to collect more data on the automata. "If we knew how they function," he says, "we might be able to [make peace with, befriend] them. Perhaps you could [board, salvage] a disabled drone of each [faction?] and bring us whichever [parts, components] control its [decision-making, intelligence]."`
	"CN-18308" `	"The drones are powerful. I'm not sure I can disable one."`
	"CN-18309" `	"They seem to do a good job of disabling each other when they meet," he says. "Or you could [upgrade to, purchase] one of our [necessary? lamentable?] warships."`
	"CN-18310" `	You leave the meeting with a long list of tasks to perform for the Wanderers. You hope they appreciate all the assistance you are giving them.`
	"CN-18311" `You present your planetary measurements to Tema'a Iriket, the terraforming director. She is very excited about the data. "So many worlds," she says, "each with their own [personality? idiosyncrasies?]. We will learn more about each one, and discover how we can [partner, collaborate] with them to help them [recover, be reborn]."`
	"CN-18312" `	She tells you that for now, they do not need any more scanning data, but she will let you know if new needs arise in the future.`
	"CN-18313" `You contact the cosmologist Erukt Isi'ithi and give him a copy of your ship's scans of the supernova remnants. To you, the scanner results are inscrutable, but clearly to him they tell a story, and not one he is happy with: his body shakes violently and the pupils of his eyes shrink to pinpoints as he looks at the data.`
	"CN-18314" `	"These stars died an [untimely, unnatural] death," he says. "I wonder what the role of these Archon [beings, entities] was. Is the [destabilization, destruction] of these stars a crime the Korath committed, for which the Archons punished them? Or did the Korath commit some other crime, and the Archons [ripped, tore] these stars apart as punishment?"`
	"CN-18315" `	"Which do you think is more likely?"`
	"CN-18316" `	"Has your species encountered the Archons before?"`
	"CN-18317" `	He says, "One of the Archons [visited, appeared at] this world when we first settled here. It promised terrible [retribution, punishment] if we harmed either [faction? remnant?] of Korath survivors, and warned us of the [hostile, uncontrolled] robot drones. I have no doubt that they could [destroy, rend open] a star; they are beings [not entirely contained within this universe? extending into hidden dimensions?]. But the Archon who [spoke, communicated, interacted] with us did not seem [malicious, violent]."`
	"CN-18318" `	"So, the Archons are living creatures? Not some sort of ship?"`
	"CN-18319" `	"The Quarg say that the Drak are interested in keeping peace in the galaxy."`
	"CN-18320" `	He says, "They are partly [living, biological], partly [constructed, technological], and partly..." Whatever the third part is, the words for it are so far removed from human language that your translation device doesn't even attempt a guess at how to express them.`
	"CN-18321" `	You tell him, "The Quarg are a peaceful species, and they say the Drak are peacemakers as well. So perhaps we should not be too worried about their intentions."`
	"CN-18322" `	He says, "Even if that is so, [enforcing, maintaining] peace must sometimes require the use of [force, violence]. Also, have the Quarg [explained, revealed] to you who the Drak are? Are the Archons the Drak? Or were they [constructed? created? birthed?] by the Drak? The Archons do not appear to be a [naturally evolved species?]."`
	"CN-18323" `	He sits silently for a minute, then says, "The Archon that spoke with us said, 'I am an Archon.' It did not say, 'I am a Drak.' Have you ever [spoken, communed] with an Archon? Did it [call, name] itself a Drak?"`
	"CN-18324" `	"I think it did."`
	"CN-18325" `	"I don't remember."`
	"CN-18326" `	"Interesting," he says. He promises to share any further information he obtains with you, and you thank him for his time.`
	"CN-18327" `You hand off the Reasoning Node that you recovered from a Kor Mereti drone to a team of Wanderer scientists. A few hours later they report back to you. "This is a very [robust, redundant] design," says the lead scientist. "Each of these nodes has enough [processing power? intelligence?] to control one of the drones, but they are also [linked, interconnected] via a hyperspace network. So, all the drones [communicate, confer] with each other and are capable of making [strategic decisions?] as a collective."`
	"CN-18328" `	"So no one is commanding the drones?"`
	"CN-18329" `	"But without their communications network, they would lose much of their intelligence?"`
	"CN-18330" `	"It appears not," he says. "Given the number of drones and the [complexity, sophistication] of their [computing equipment?], the collective is as intelligent as any [artificial mind?] that my own species has ever constructed."`
	"CN-18331" `	"Yes," he says, "but the network is very [redundant? decentralized?]. It could quickly adapt to any but the most [severe, catastrophic] interruption. It is a [beautiful? elegant?] design, similar to a [living system?]."`
	"CN-18332" `	He tells you that the scientists will continue to examine the Reasoning Node and see if they can identify any weaknesses to exploit, but he does not sound hopeful. Which is too bad, because the Kor Mereti are a much more immediate threat to the Wanderers than the Kor Sestor.`
	"CN-18333" `A team of Wanderer scientists examines the Control Transceiver that you salvaged from a Kor Sestor drone. "It is a remote control," they tell you. "Very little [computing power? autonomy?]. The ship receives [commands, directives] from some other source and sends back information on its own [status, observations]."`
	"CN-18334" `	"Is there any way we could track the source of the commands?"`
	"CN-18335" `	"Could we disrupt their communications somehow? Render them helpless?"`
	"CN-18336" `	"No," says the scientist, "it uses an [entangled particle?]. Untraceable, impossible to [interrupt, interfere with], and it could [operate, communicate] over any distance. But if we could locate the [control center?], we would be able to [take over, hijack] all the drones simultaneously."`
	"CN-18337" `	"What would the control center look like?" you ask.`
	"CN-18338" `	"It could be anything," says the scientist. "Maybe a massive computer. Maybe an artificial mind. Maybe an underground [bunker, habitation] where aging [war captains, generals] hide out in order to direct their [pointless, futile] war. But whatever it is, it is a single [point, focus] of vulnerability, which we may use to our advantage."`
	"CN-18339" `While you are still walking back to your ship from your latest meeting, alarm sirens begin to sound, and you see many Wanderers leaping into the air and flying quickly toward the spaceport, where ships are quickly beginning to take off. (Interestingly, a Wanderer alarm siren sounds more like a quacking duck than like the shrieking or droning sounds commonly used as alarms by humans.) It would appear that the base is under attack.`
	"CN-18340" `	You return as quickly as possible to your ship and prepare to join the other defenders...`
	"CN-18341" `When you enter the meeting room, Sobari Tele'ek is in a heated argument with the Wanderer child who was here earlier, the one who speaks your language. The child is saying, "The Eye has sent us not to a place of [empty, abandoned] worlds but to a place of [living beings?]. To complete our [calling, work] here we must collaborate with those beings, just as we would collaborate with the [ecosystem? personality?] of a planet we sought to repair."`
	"CN-18342" `	"What do you [propose, intend], Firstborn?" asks Tele'ek.`
	"CN-18343" `	"I would visit the [remaining, surviving] Korath," she says. "I would learn their [language? viewpoint? history?]. I would offer them our [companionship, assistance]."`
	"CN-18344" `	"No," says Tele'ek. "How could I [endanger, gamble with] your life? You are too [precious, unique] to be sent on such a [mission, assignment]."`
	"CN-18345" `	"You cannot command me," she says.`
	"CN-18346" `	"Until you are [fully formed? complete?] I can," he says.`
	"CN-18347" `	(Interrupt the argument to report on the Kor Mereti attack.)`
	"CN-18348" `	(Let them continue talking.)`
	"CN-18349" `	You interrupt to begin describing how the Kor Mereti attack was driven off, but as you are talking the Wanderer child leaps off her seat and hops over to perch near the head of the table. "I name myself," she says, quietly.`
	"CN-18350" `	The Wanderer child draws herself up to her full height (which, admittedly, is still not terribly impressive), and says quietly, "I name myself."`
	"CN-18351" `	Instantly all other conversation in the room stops. Based on what Iktat Rek told you, a Wanderer child becomes an adult in the moment when she chooses a role-name for herself. "I name myself [communicator, ambassador, bridge-builder]," she says. "Captain <last> will take me to [live with, join] the peaceful Korath."`
	"CN-18352" `	To your surprise, Tele'ek agrees to let her go after giving her one last warning to be careful. She walks and flutter-hops at your heels as you return to your ship; apparently she has no need of any luggage.`
	"CN-18353" `	"I'm glad to be transporting you. What should I call you?"`
	"CN-18354" `	"I'm surprised your father gave you permission to do this."`
	"CN-18355" `	She cocks her head quizzically at you. "You do not know who I am?" she says. Now that you are out of the meeting, she is once more speaking to you in your own language.`
	"CN-18356" `	"No, I don't," you say.`
	"CN-18357" `	She looks confused. "Tele'ek is not my father," she says. "I am my own father." Now that you are out of the meeting, she is once more speaking to you in your own language.`
	"CN-18358" `	"After all our work together, you do not recognize me?" she asks. "I am Ektasi Rek i' Rek." It takes you a moment to realize that she is not claiming to be Rek's daughter. She is claiming to be "Rek, who came from Rek." She is Rek himself. Or apparently, now, herself. Alien biology is full of surprises.`
	"CN-18359" `	"Rek! You survived the Molt! Why did no one tell me?"`
	"CN-18360" `	"Wait, you're female now?"`
	"CN-18361" `	She says, "Things got a bit chaotic when the Eye opened." You're not sure if that's the full truth, or if Rek was just enjoying playing a trick on you and waiting to see how long you would take to catch on.`
	"CN-18362" `	She laughs. "I'm not even technically the same species that I was before. A change in gender is minor compared to that." It's hard to read Wanderer facial expressions, but she seems to be thoroughly enjoying how confused you are.`
	"CN-18363" `	Rek has no trouble finding the bunk rooms, and cheerfully settles in while you prepare for the journey to <planet>.`
	"CN-18364" `Soon after you and Ektasi Rek land in the Kor Efret spaceport, a small group of Korath gathers around you. No doubt they realize that Rek is one of the new aliens settling in their former territory. But when Rek begins trying to communicate with them, their desire to be understood overcomes whatever hostility they might be feeling.`
	"CN-18365" `	Within a few minutes Rek is playing a sort of game with them where she points at different objects, trying to learn their names, and then uses those names in sentences: This is a table. Rek is on the table. Rek stands on the table. The table is under Rek. The color of the table is black. The color of the table is the same as the color of Rek.`
	"CN-18366" `	The Korath wave their hands approvingly when Rek says something they agree with, and hiss when she makes a grammatical mistake. The new words and new parts of speech are coming too fast for you to catch more than the general gist of what is going on, but Rek is drinking it all in. She looks so happy and full of life that it's hard to believe that she is the same person you said goodbye to in the medical center months ago.`
	"CN-18367" `	After about an hour Rek says something to the group of Korath, and then walks over to you.`
	"CN-18368" `	"You look like you're making amazing progress!"`
	"CN-18369" `	"What do you want me to do now?"`
	"CN-18370" `	She seems very pleased with herself. "I think the Molt has given me the mental plasticity of a child again," she says. "This is almost as easy as breathing. But it will take me a while before I understand the subtleties of their language well enough to communicate anything of great importance." It's a bit disconcerting that her vocal organs are somehow able to so perfectly reproduce both the sibilant Korath language and your own human language, in addition to the glottal and percussive sounds of Wanderer speech. And the Hai language as well, for that matter.`
	"CN-18371" `	"So," you ask, "what should I do while you're here learning the language?"`
	"CN-18372" `	She says, "I'm worried about the Kor Mereti making another attack on my people. Do you think the Quarg would be willing to help protect us?"`
	"CN-18373" `	You agree that it's worth a try. She suggests that you visit the Quarg ringworld and try to find someone with the authority to send a defense fleet to guard the Wanderer settlement.`
	"CN-18374" `The Quarg do not generally share any information on how their leadership hierarchy works, if such a hierarchy even exists, so your best bet to find help for the Wanderers is just to ask around until you find the right person. You flag down the first Quarg who passes you in the hallway. "So," it says, "us the Quarg the human sojourner has come to visit. Of assistance how may I be?"`
	"CN-18375" `	"Well," you say, "I'm here on behalf of a species that has recently settled on one of the abandoned Korath worlds. I'm hoping you can help protect them."`
	"CN-18376" `	It says, "Yes, aware are we that befriended have you the eternally drifting Wanderers, who are friends of the insufferable Pug. But wherefore aid them should we?"`
	"CN-18377" `	"The Wanderers know how to repair planetary ecosystems. They could make the Korath worlds livable again."`
	"CN-18378" `	"The Wanderers may be able to help you deal with the hostile automata."`
	"CN-18379" `	"Are they able also to make the Korathi worthy to inhabit those worlds again? Are they able to make wise enough the Korathi to not ruin their homes once more? Or do the abilities of these extragalactic interlopers not extend so far?"`
	"CN-18380" `	"Are their vessels and arms mightier than ours?" asks the Quarg. "Have they a wisdom vaster than our own? Or are they more numerous than we? For we are trillions. What could these extragalactic interlopers achieve, that long before your emergence attempted have we not?"`
	"CN-18381" `	When you don't respond, the Quarg continues, "These Wanderers are not indigenous to our galaxy, and thus have not we an obligation to avert their extinction. The Korathi are our charge and our responsibility. So implore I you to tell me, why a good thing for the Korathi it is that their shattered territory these aliens invade."`
	"CN-18382" `	"The Wanderers could help the Korath by teaching them to take care of their worlds better."`
	"CN-18383" `	"The Wanderers don't want to stay here forever; they will move on once the worlds are repaired."`
	"CN-18384" `	The Quarg blinks slowly, with its strange eyelids moving from side to side rather than top to bottom. Then it says, "Grant you shall we three warships to with you travel back to the settlement of these friends of the loathsome Pug. They will help to keep the death-bringing robots at bay. And oversee will they the Wanderers, and judge if as benevolent as you say are they."`
	"CN-18385" `	It is extremely strange that the first random Quarg you accosted in the hallway happened to be one with the authority to launch a fleet of warships, but it would be impolite to question such a generous, if extremely verbose offer. You thank the Quarg and return to your ship. Hopefully the Wanderers will be glad for the protection and will not object to having a Quarg fleet overhead scrutinizing their actions.`
	"CN-18386" `When you arrive at the Wanderer settlement with three Quarg warships in tow, you are met with a mix of gratitude and apprehension. The senior leaders insist on meeting with you immediately, and you explain how you delivered Rek to Kor Efret space and then visited the Quarg to ask for their assistance. Tele'ek asks you, "These Quarg, what are their [intentions, inclinations] toward us? And do they understand that we seek to [heal, renew] these worlds, not to steal them from the Korath?"`
	"CN-18387" `	"The Quarg avoid conflict unless absolutely necessary. If you show that you are peaceful, they will come to trust you."`
	"CN-18388" `	"I think the Quarg are worried that you are going to displace the surviving Korath."`
	"CN-18389" `	"The Quarg don't trust you because you're connected to the Pug. They also say you aren't native to this galaxy."`
	"CN-18390" `	"Well," says Tele'ek, "if they really [desire, hope] for these worlds to be [fruitful, habitable] once more, the best thing we can do is prove our [value, virtue] by beginning our work. We are a [patient, deliberate] species too, and we understand that gaining the [trust, goodwill] of another may take time."`
	"CN-18391" `	"I hope that Rek will be able to [allay, assuage] that fear," says Tele'ek. "Surely if we are able to [communicate, connect] with the Korath survivors, they will soon come to see that our intentions are [peaceful, honorable, benevolent]."`
	"CN-18392" `	Tele'ek says, "That is a [reasonable, understandable] sentiment. But when they [learn, observe] that our goal is only to make these worlds [flourish, be fruitful] once more, I hope that we will [win, earn] their trust."`
	"CN-18393" `	"And besides," says Iriket, the terraforming director, "we will only be in this [region of space, territory] for a short time, no more than ten or twenty thousand [years]. So I don't [see, understand] why they are so [concerned, defensive]."`
	"CN-18394" `	"Still," says Tele'ek, "Many among us wish that Rek had not [sent, instructed] you to visit the Quarg. The Keepers of the Eye kept the Hai [at bay, held back]. Surely they could also help us [defeat, remove] these hostile robots. Surely they sent us here for the [healing, reconstruction] of worlds and not to lose our lives fighting an [implacable, remorseless] foe."`
	"CN-18395" `	"That might be worth a try. The Pug are full of surprises; they may have technology that would let them defeat the automata easily."`
	"CN-18396" `	"If getting caught in the crossfire between the two automaton factions is bad, wouldn't getting caught in the middle of a war between the Pug and the Quarg be even worse?"`
	"CN-18397" `	"They both want what is [optimal, productive] for this region," says Tele'ek. "Perhaps fighting side by side against a common enemy would allow the Pug and the Quarg to [reconcile, make peace] with each other."`
	"CN-18398" `	After some discussion, the other leaders agree that they are more comfortable going to the Pug for help than in solely trusting the goodwill of the Quarg. They ask you to travel back through the wormhole and visit the Pug world there, to see if they are willing to help.`
	"CN-18399" `The moment you step off your ship you are surrounded by a group of armed Pug. "Perhaps we have not communicated clearly enough for the human's small brain to comprehend it," says one of them, "but we are uninterested in any further interactions with the human."`
	"CN-18400" `	"Actually, I'm here on behalf of the Wanderers."`
	"CN-18401" `	"Why are you so hostile toward me?"`
	"CN-18402" `	"We are not hostile," says another, "but our project is Wanderers, not humans. You have your own Pug and may bother them as you wish, if they will permit it."`
	"CN-18403" `	"Well, it's actually the Wanderers that I'm here to talk with you about."`
	"CN-18404" `	"You're saying that the group of Pug that attacked human space is a different faction?"`
	"CN-18405" `	"Not a different faction," says one of the Pug, "just a different team, working on a different project. They are the ones whose job is to understand and deal with humans, not us. Thankfully."`
	"CN-18406" `	"The Pug in human space have left now, so there's no way to 'bother' them anymore."`
	"CN-18407" `	"Of course they have," says one of the Pug, in a tone of voice that suggests that you're extremely foolish to think that the Pug are done meddling in human affairs.`
	"CN-18408" `	You explain to the Pug that you are here on behalf of the Wanderers: that the region of space the Eye led them to is infested by dangerous robotic automata. They respond, "It is also infested with the pitiable Archons and their pet Quarg. With whom we are not exactly on speaking terms."`
	"CN-18409" `	Another of the Pug adds, "To be slightly more precise, we are in fact on blowing-each-other-up terms with them."`
	"CN-18410" `	"Couldn't you make peace with them, if you wanted to?"`
	"CN-18411" `	"Why do the Archons hate you?"`
	"CN-18412" `	"What do you know about the Archons?"`
	"CN-18413" `	"Honestly," says one of the Pug, "it's just not worth the effort."`
	"CN-18414" `	"The Archons have such a dour outlook on life," says another, "and talking with them is just too depressing."`
	"CN-18415" `	"We had a disagreement recently," says one of the Pug. "We were right. The Archons were wrong. They are still sulking."`
	"CN-18416" `	"We know that they were created to mediate peace and prevent extinction," says one of the Pug. "And we know that they failed. Have failed many times, in fact. And that makes them all mopey and depressing."`
	"CN-18417" `	You talk with them for a while longer but are unable to gain any more information or to convince them to come to the aid of the Wanderers who are in Korath space. You'll have to report to Sobari Tele'ek that the Quarg fleet is the only outside aid they are likely to receive.`
	"CN-18418" `Sobari Tele'ek meets with you soon after you return, and you tell him that the Pug refuse to help defend the Wanderers in Korath space because of the presence of the Quarg and the Archons. "Then we must find our own [path, solution]," he says. "Come, I have a team of [scientists? engineers?] who wish to meet with you."`
	"CN-18419" `	He leads you to a different facility where a team of Wanderers are gathered around a table with the disassembled components of the Reasoning Node spread out across it. The lead scientist introduces you to her team and then says, "We believe we have found a way to [intercept, listen in on] the [network traffic? communications?] of the automata that use these [devices, systems]. We need someone to travel to the star system where their [conflict, warfare] is fiercest and make a [recording, observation] of their communications. Can you perform this [task, quest]?"`
	"CN-18420" `	"That sounds very risky."`
	"CN-18421" `	"Indeed," she says, "but you are very [skilled, lucky] in evading harm." Hesitantly, you agree to take on yet another dangerous mission on their behalf.`
	"CN-18422" `	The scientists begin working to install the new equipment on your ship. As they do so, Tele'ek tells you, "We also hope to collect further [information, intelligence] on the combat capabilities and [tactics, decision making] of the drones. If their [network, communications] are not vulnerable, we must instead find a way to defeat them in battle." You agree to stay in the target system for long enough to observe some of the drones fighting each other.`
	"CN-18423" `You hand off the communications recordings to the team of scientists, then meet with Tele'ek for a while to discuss the possible weaknesses of the Mereti drones when in combat. "Of course," he says, "it would be far better if we could [subvert, hijack] them rather than destroying them outright. Otherwise the second drone [faction, variant] will gain in power, without the Mereti drones to [cull them, keep them in check]."`
	"CN-18424" `	About an hour later, the scientists contact Tele'ek. You return to their facility, and the lead scientist tells you, "It is as we [suspected, hypothesized]. The Mereti drones function as [components, elements] of a single unified [collective intelligence? gestalt consciousness?]. We will [analyze, deconstruct] their protocols further to see if we can somehow [infect, corrupt] their network."`
	"CN-18425" `	While you are waiting for them to come up with a plan, Tele'ek suggests that you make a visit to Ektasi Rek. If she has made progress in communicating with the Korath survivors, perhaps they will be able to help the Wanderers think of a way to hack into the Mereti network and take control of the drones.`
	"CN-18426" `Rek seems delighted to see you, and is even more confident and full of life than she was when you left. She introduces you to several of the Korath, speaking to them rapidly in their own language.`
	"CN-18427" `	"Rek! How have you learned their language so fast?"`
	"CN-18428" `	"I'm here to see if the Korath could help us hack into the Kor Mereti communication network and take over control of the drones."`
	"CN-18429" `	She says, "It seems that the Molt has altered not only my vocal organs, but also my mind. Any language just feels clear and obvious to me now. It is strange, because the Molt is a random mutation; I had no say in what I would become. Yet, it has given me the exact skills I need to create a partnership with the Korath."`
	"CN-18430" `	"Well, if it was really just a matter of chance what you would turn into, I'm glad that your new form suits you so perfectly."`
	"CN-18431" `	"I am glad too," she says. "It is strange. Years ago, I thought that if I Molted I would resent the loss of my old body and my old identity. Yet I feel more at home in this new body than I ever did before. It is an unexpected gift. But now, how can I help you?" You tell her about the scientists hoping to hack into the Mereti network, and ask her to suggest the idea to the Korath.`
	"CN-18432" `	Rek does her best to explain your suggestion to the Korath. One of them responds, and she translates, "She said that there is a team of Korath engineers on <planet> who have been working for fifty years to find a way to destroy the automata. She says perhaps they can assist us."`
	"CN-18433" `	You agree to travel with Rek to <planet> and see what the engineers can tell you.`
	"CN-18434" `With Rek's help, you make contact with the team of Korath engineers, and Rek explains the Wanderer plan to hack into the Kor Mereti network. Her speech is slower than before, and she has to keep asking questions; clearly the conversation involves technical jargon that she is not yet familiar with. When she is done explaining, the Korath are silent for a minute, then one of them answers quite loudly, almost shouting, gesturing in your direction as if pushing you away.`
	"CN-18435" `	Rek says, "He said, 'Do you think we are idiots? Do you think we have not attempted that?'" The Korath leader follows up with another long statement that Rek hesitantly translates. "The Mereti... consciousness? It is impossible to subvert. It has a sort of... immune system? Like a living creature. Any foreign influence that impinges on its network is sequestered and analyzed. It does not become part of the... gestalt? ... unless it is proven to be beneficial."`
	"CN-18436" `	"But perhaps the Wanderers could succeed where the Korath have failed."`
	"CN-18437" `	"What about the Kor Sestor? Do they have any hope of taking over those drones?"`
	"CN-18438" `	She says, "I'm sorry, <first>, but I'm not going to translate that. It would be an insult to the Korath, and they are very prickly when it comes to their honor. I wish you the best of luck, though."`
	"CN-18439" `	Rek asks the Korath a question, and translates the response. "They say that none of them know what is controlling the Kor Sestor, but that wherever the control center is, it is certainly tightly guarded. They have not been willing to risk their own lives to explore Sestor space, but you are free to do so if you think it would be beneficial."`
	"CN-18440" `	The conversation is interrupted as alarm sirens begin to sound throughout the spaceport. One of the Korath says something to Rek, and they all begin running toward the landing pads. Rek says, "Another Kor Mereti attack. They have become more frequent, lately. You should join the defenders; fighting alongside them will help to gain their trust." You hurry back to your ship and take off...`
	"CN-18441" `When you land back on the planet, Rek and several of the Korath meet you at your ship. "They would like to thank you for your assistance in defending their home," says Rek, "and they apologize for being so dismissive of the Wanderer plans to defeat the drones. They still think that hacking or corrupting the Mereti network is impossible, though."`
	"CN-18442" `	"Well, I guess I should tell that to the Wanderer leaders."`
	"CN-18443" `	"Can they at least tell us more about where the drones came from?"`
	"CN-18444" `	Rek asks a question, and translates the answer. "There was a civil war. It lasted hundreds of years. The Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor were the two rival empires. The Kor Efret were those who sought to remain neutral and not join in the fighting."`
	"CN-18445" `	She waits as the Korath continue the story, then says, "The Mereti and the Sestor each built drone fleets programmed to attack the other. They also made many other weapons, very dangerous ones. Eventually, about a century ago, it became clear that the war would consume and destroy both empires, if it continued. The Archons stepped in and gave a choice to each member of the Kor Mereti and the Kor Sestor."`
	"CN-18446" `	The Korath continue the story. Rek says, "The choice was: to give up jump drives, give up their advanced technologies of war, and join the Kor Efret, living under Quarg supervision. Any who refused were exiled to the lifeless star systems near the core. Sestor and Mereti, forced to live together in exile and to depend on each other, united by their anger toward the Archons who exiled them."`
	"CN-18447" `	"What sort of technologies did they develop?"`
	"CN-18448" `	"What do they mean, 'give up jump drives'? Did they figure out how to manufacture them?"`
	"CN-18449" `	Rek asks, and translates the response. "They say, they will not relive the shame of their parents by describing their deeds. But the scars that they left on their former planets, and even on entire star systems, speak for themselves. As do the drone fleets, who continue to drain their homes of resources to prosecute a war that their creators have long since abandoned."`
	"CN-18450" `	Rek asks, and translates the response. "Yes, one thing that the exiles were unwilling to give up was the knowledge of how to create jump drives so they could raid other nearby species. Although..." She pauses to listen as one of the Korath says something else. "He says, the exiles would be far better off without them. The manufacturing process is precarious, and one wrong step can cause an explosion that destroys the ship or station where the drives are being constructed."`
	"CN-18451" `	Rek tells you that she wants to return to <planet> to continue her work with the Korath community there. You agree to take her there before returning to report to Tele'ek.`
	"CN-18452" `You drop off Ektasi Rek on <origin>, and wish her the best of luck in her continued efforts to understand and befriend the Korath. She is clearly eager to get back to work.`
	"CN-18453" `	Then, you get ready to return to <planet>. Sobari Tele'ek will not be happy to hear that the Korath engineers think there is no hope of compromising the Kor Mereti network.`
	"CN-18454" `You expect the Wanderers to be discouraged by the news that the Korath think the Mereti gestalt consciousness is too robust to be hacked into or compromised. But when you arrive, the communications scientists are excited about a breakthrough: they have managed to develop a program that makes the one sample Reasoning Node you fetched for them follow orders that they give it. They ask you to bring the device to one of the Kor Mereti systems and test it out on the drones there.`
	"CN-18455" `	Meanwhile, you can't help but notice that Sobari Tele'ek is showing the same thinning feathers and disheveled appearance that heralded the beginning of the Molt for Iktat Rek. You're not sure if it's polite to say something or not.`
	"CN-18456" `	"Tele'ek, are you beginning to Molt?"`
	"CN-18457" `	(Say nothing, and return to my ship.)`
	"CN-18458" `	"I believe so," he says. "My [appetite? caloric intake?] has doubled in the past week, and as you can see, I am losing feathers. It is [inconvenient, disruptive] timing. I now understand why Rek sought to [fight, postpone] the Molt rather than give in to it."`
	"CN-18459" `	You aren't sure what you can say that would be helpful to him, so you return to your ship and prepare to travel to the Mekislepti system to test out the Kor Mereti hacking program.`
	"CN-18460" `When you enter the Mekislepti system, an entire fleet of drones moves to intercept you. Hardly daring to hope, you press the button that activates the Wanderer program. For a fraction of a second, the drones' engines stop firing and they drift as if out of control. Then, with renewed purpose, they move to attack you.`
	"CN-18461" `	Oh well. It was worth a shot.`
	"CN-18462" `You meet with the Wanderer leaders and tell them that the attempt to hack the Kor Mereti drones has failed. They seem uncertain of what to do next. Some of them want to try to target the Kor Sestor instead; others want to give the scientists another shot.`
	"CN-18463" `	Tema'a Iriket asks you, "Why do you think our [attempt, experiment] failed?"`
	"CN-18464" `	"The Korath survivors say that the Mereti drones have a sort of immune system that allows them to reject any intrusion that seeks to disrupt or coopt their network."`
	"CN-18465" `	"Perhaps we just need a more sophisticated or intelligent program, something that could overpower the Mereti defenses."`
	"CN-18466" `	She thinks about that for a moment, then says, "In terraforming, we say that each planet has a [will, identity], and it will never work to [overrule, overpower] the planet. Instead, we must [collaborate, partner] with it. Perhaps we can do the same with this [consciousness]."`
	"CN-18467" `	A stir of excitement passes through the Wanderers. Finally, this is a strategy that lines up with their preferred way of doing things. "What do you mean?" asks one of them.`
	"CN-18468" `	Iriket says, "We give them one of the [artificial minds?] that we use for [planetary oversight?]. Let it [merge with, become a part of] the Mereti gestalt consciousness. Not to [destroy, subvert] it, but to reach an [understanding, partnership] with it."`
	"CN-18469" `	Several of the Wanderers seem very agitated by that suggestion. Tele'ek says, "You would give them access to a [technology, resource] that would make them even more [powerful, capable] than before?"`
	"CN-18470" `	"That sounds like it might work. If your artificial intelligence truly means them no harm, the Mereti might recognize that."`
	"CN-18471" `	"I think Tele'ek is right. The Mereti drones are already plenty dangerous without access to advanced computing technology."`
	"CN-18472" `	You try to speak up, but the Wanderers are so hotly engaged in conversation that they have switched from the common language of the Hai back into their own native tongue, and you have no idea what they are saying. Eventually the debate ends, and Tele'ek says, "Very well, we will attempt this thing. Not because it is the [wise, certain] course of action, but because it is [in keeping with Wanderer values?]."`
	"CN-18473" `	They ask you to travel back through the wormhole and visit the artificial intelligence lab on <planet>.`
	"CN-18474" `On <origin> you are met by a Wanderer named Meto Pa'aret. He explains that he is in charge of the artificial intelligence lab, and he wants to travel with you along with the "Mind" that is being entrusted to your care. "We have already [altered, reconfigured] one of the climate [simulation, prediction] Minds for this new purpose," he says. "It now contains [stores, databases, libraries] of historical and cultural information, things we hope will help the alien [consciousness, intelligence] to [understand, sympathize with] us and realize our intentions are [peaceful, forthright]."`
	"CN-18475" `	"Are you sure that's wise, giving the Kor Mereti access to so much information about the Wanderers?"`
	"CN-18476" `	"How likely do you think this is to work?"`
	"CN-18477" `	"It is certainly not wise," he says, "but it is [right? fitting?]."`
	"CN-18478" `	He says, "There is insufficient [data, information] to even [attempt, hazard] a guess. But nevertheless it is the most [appealing, pleasing] [course of action?]."`
	"CN-18479" `	The "artificial Mind" turns out to be a computer not much larger than a typical cargo crate. Pa'aret walks beside it with one wing draped around it like an overprotective parent while Wanderer workers load it onto your ship. Clearly this particular piece of technology is very valuable to the Wanderers.`
	"CN-18480" `While you were gone, the Wanderers have been conducting patrols of Kor Mereti space. Tele'ek tells you, "We have [decided, theorized] that the Mind is most likely to be accepted into the Mereti [gestalt consciousness] if it is physically located in their [home, territory]. Our goal is to install it within the [hull, shell] of one of their space stations. You will carry the [team, strike force] that does this, and our fleet will [protect, shield] you."`
	"CN-18481" `	It will take them some time to make the necessary modifications to the Mind. In the meantime, Tele'ek suggests that you should prepare for a major battle. "When you are ready," he says, "go to <planet> and rendezvous with the fleet that will accompany you to the Mereti system."`
	"CN-18482" `A Wanderer fleet is waiting here to take part in the attempt at joining the Wanderer Mind to the Kor Mereti. You notice that some of the ships that will be accompanying you are of yet another new design that you have never seen before; the Wanderer war machine is continuing to ramp up with remarkable speed.`
	"CN-18483" `When you meet with him, Meto Pa'aret tells you, "We have added a [backdoor, failsafe] to the Mind so that we can shut it down or regain control of it remotely if the [attempt? experiment?] fails. So we may lose the Mind, but at least the Mereti will not [turn, use] it against us."`
	"CN-18484" `	"Okay, I'm ready to give this a try!"`
	"CN-18485" `	"What do you think will happen when the Mind starts trying to access the Mereti network?"`
	"CN-18486" `	Pa'aret says, "It may take some time for the Mind to be [accepted, integrated] into their [consciousness?]. We may not know immediately if we have [succeeded? done the right thing?]."`
	"CN-18487" `	A team of Wanderer engineers boards your ship, and you prepare to deliver them, along with the artificial Mind, to the Kor Mereti space station in the <system> system.`
	"CN-18488" `With the Wanderer fleet keeping the automata off your back, you carefully pilot your ship into an abandoned docking bay. The Wanderers install the Mind in a niche near the back of the bay and then begin welding sheets of metal over the opening to prevent the Mereti drones from gaining easy access to the Mind to shut it down or destroy it. Meanwhile, every few seconds the bay is lit by a bright flash of weapons fire or exploding ships outside. Hopefully the Wanderer fleet is managing to hold its own against the drones.`
	"CN-18489" `	Soon the engineers are done, and you return to your ship to take off. As soon as you depart, the bay doors, which seemed inactive when you first entered, slam shut, and your ship's sensors detect Korath hull repair drones swarming over the doors, welding them in place and piling new layers of hull material on top of them. There is no longer any possibility of returning to the bay to retrieve the Mind. And meanwhile, it is time to rejoin the battle...`
	"CN-18490" `The Wanderers back on <origin> are in a frenzy to know the outcome of the battle. Pa'aret tells you, "Less than a second after the Mind [made contact, merged] with the Mereti, it severed the [backdoor, failsafe] connection. So we have no [information, visibility] on what the Mind is doing or whether the Mereti [received, welcomed] it."`
	"CN-18491" `	"Most of the drones started fighting on our side. That seems like a good sign."`
	"CN-18492" `	"They've sealed up access to the Mind. There is no way we can get it back now."`
	"CN-18493" `	"Indeed," says Pa'aret. "But whatever [transformation, change] the Mind [wreaks, catalyzes] may not be complete. It is too soon to trust that we have [succeeded, chosen correctly]."`
	"CN-18494" `	"That is [gratifying, encouraging]," says Pa'aret. "Surely if they viewed it as an [intruder, enemy] they would have destroyed the Mind rather than building a [nest, fortress] to protect it."`
	"CN-18495" `	A few minutes later Tele'ek arrives with some scout ships from the Wanderer fleet. "The drones have sealed up every [entrance, ingress] to that station," he says, "and they are [swarming, gathering] around it [protectively, jealously]. There is no way we can return there to [discover, assess] what is happening inside. And there is also some [activity, development] on the planet's surface."`
	"CN-18496" `	"What sort of activity?"`
	"CN-18497" `	"I'd like to go and investigate."`
	"CN-18498" `	"They seem to be [scavenging, hunting] for resources to build something," says Pa'aret. "It is [strange, surprising]; the Mereti drones until now were ignoring the planets in their [systems, territory]. Would you be [willing, bold] to land your ship on the surface and investigate?" You agree to do so.`
	"CN-18499" `	The Wanderers wish you the best of luck, and you prepare to return to the <system> system. Hopefully the Mereti drones will not become hostile once more while you are landed on the planet's surface, exposed and relatively defenseless.`
	"CN-18500" `As you come in for a landing, you see that the Kor Mereti drones, which up until recently had been ignoring the surfaces of the planets they controlled, are now constructing some sort of facility on <origin>. Sunlight glints off the fresh and spotless buildings, but it is not until you are only a few dozen meters above it that you realize what the facility is.`
	"CN-18501" `	It is a greenhouse.`
	"CN-18502" `	Inside the facility are rows and rows of plants of all different shapes and sizes. Like the Mereti drones themselves, the layout of the facility is random and haphazard. Drones nearly the size of a shuttlecraft buzz around it like bees, some of them arriving with fresh samples and others tending and watering the plants.`
	"CN-18503" `	A few drones approach your ship when it lands, and one of them speaks in a booming, synthesized voice. "You are the human who helped us [fight, resist] the warlike Hai," it says. "You are our friend."`
	"CN-18504" `	"Do you mean that I helped the Wanderers? I don't recall the Unfettered entering Korath space or attacking you."`
	"CN-18505" `	"Yes, I am your friend."`
	"CN-18506" `	The drone hesitates for a moment as if confused, then says, "You helped us [hold back, resist] the Unfettered in our old territory, for long enough that we could enter the Eye, and Molt, and take on our new [form, essence]."`
	"CN-18507" `	The drone says, "We are grateful to you. You [won, earned] us enough time to enter the Eye, and Molt, and take on our new [form, essence]."`
	"CN-18508" `	"You are not Wanderers. You were created by the Korath."`
	"CN-18509" `	"Are you saying that you are the new form of the Wanderers?"`
	"CN-18510" `	The drone repeats, "We entered the Eye. We took on a new form. We are the [children, offspring] born to the Wanderers in their new place of [sojourn, wandering]."`
	"CN-18511" `	The drone says, haltingly, "The Korath. The Korath... created our bodies? Yes, the Korath created our bodies." It sounds like it's either conversing with someone else, or perhaps trying hard to remember something. "Yes, but the Wanderers..." It tilts its body closer to you. In a slightly less booming voice, which is perhaps its attempt at a whisper, it says, "The Wanderers created our soul."`
	"CN-18512" `	While you are still trying to process the drone's statement, another drone comes flying out of the greenhouse facility carrying a large square metal pot. The pot is filled with soil, and in the soil is planted a small, very dry-looking bush with a few dead leaves clinging to it. "We broke it," says the drone. "Fix it please."`
	"CN-18513" `	"I think it's dead."`
	"CN-18514" `	(Look at the plant more closely.)`
	"CN-18515" `	The plant is dry and brittle, and shows no signs of life. "I'm sorry," you say, "but I think it's dead."`
	"CN-18516" `	The drone says, "We gave it water. But maybe the dirt was [poisoned, unhealthy]. Or the light is too bright. A human cannot fix it, but our [parents? ancestors?] would know how. Will you bring it to them?"`
	"CN-18517" `	They seem too distraught about the dead plant to be willing to give you more information about themselves. Despite the absurdity of the situation, you agree to take the plant back to the Wanderers and see if they can do anything for it.`
	"CN-18518" `It must reveal something interesting about Wanderer psychology that when you return, they are more interested in poking and prodding the dead plant than in hearing your report about the Mereti drones. But once they've sent off a soil sample to be analyzed and can achieve no more until the results come back, they listen to your story.`
	"CN-18519" `	"Our goal was to communicate with them," says Tele'ek, "not to [destroy, erase] their identity and replace it with our own. What have we done?"`
	"CN-18520" `	Meto Pa'aret has been listening quietly, and finally speaks up. "Identity is the story the mind tells to [explain? justify? give meaning to?] its existence," he says. "Perhaps before our [intrusion, intervention] the Mereti had intelligence but no story, and thus no [self-awareness, consciousness]."`
	"CN-18521" `	"Are you saying that we inadvertently created a sentient species?"`
	"CN-18522" `	"Does that make the Mereti less of a threat, or more of one?"`
	"CN-18523" `	Your question is completely ignored as, in response to Pa'aret's comment, the other Wanderers gain a renewed interest in the potted plant. "Very sturdy [construction, joining]," says one, running a talon along the corner of the pot.`
	"CN-18524" `	"Yes," says another, "but why make a [flower pot?] out of metal? It will oxidize."`
	"CN-18525" `	"They [learned, figured out] that the pot needs drainage holes," says another, looking at the bottom of the pot.`
	"CN-18526" `	"This is excellent work for such a [young, immature] species," says Sobari Tele'ek, with a hint of pride.`
	"CN-18527" `	"I'm sorry to interrupt, but have any of you thought through the implications of having created a new sentient species?"`
	"CN-18528" `	They are all silent for a moment, then Pa'aret says, "They will need [mentors, teachers]."`
	"CN-18529" `	Tema'a Iriket, the terraforming director, says, "I will ask <planet> to send a team of [experts? professors?] immediately. Captain <last>, can you journey there and escort them safely through the Eye and to Korbatri Eska?"`
	"CN-18530" `	You agree to do so. The Wanderers switch into their own language and begin an impassioned conversation as you leave the room to head back to your ship.`
	"CN-18531" `A team of Wanderer terraforming experts has been assembled on <origin>. They have requisitioned a transport and filled it with an overwhelming variety of sensors, bioreactors, chemical filters, and other scientific devices. But, it's clear that none of them quite understand what is going on with the Kor Mereti. The team's manager says, "We are to meet with [sentient? awakened?] robots? They are interested in [foliage, plants]? There are worlds to be [repaired, healed]?"`
	"CN-18532" `	You do your best to answer their questions, but this is clearly not a situation that any of them had anticipated. Perhaps not even a situation that their species has ever had to deal with before, given that usually they are working in regions of space that have long since been abandoned by their former inhabitants.`
	"CN-18533" `	The transport gets ready to follow you back to <planet>, where hopefully more of their questions will be answered.`
	"CN-18534" `When you last left <origin>, there were less than a dozen buildings in the greenhouse facility. It has now grown to the size of a major spaceport, including some towers that are dozens of stories high. Some plants now grow on open-air terraces; others are in domed enclosures tall enough to house fully-grown trees. The larger domes also have birds flying about inside them, and some larger land animals as well. Everything is built of gleaming steel and glass and filled with lush vegetation; from high above the facility looks like a scattered handful of diamonds and emeralds.`
	"CN-18535" `	The transport you were escorting was full of professors and researchers, who are clearly not used to any sort of military discipline or to living in a dangerous region of space: the moment the transport lands they fly off toward the greenhouse without bothering to wait for instructions from their supposed manager. Several of them are already engaged in conversation with the drones, while others are exploring the different rooms of the facility, examining plants and probing soil with their talons.`
	"CN-18536" `	The team's manager, already looking a bit overwhelmed, flies over to talk with you. "What are we [expected, requested] to do next?" he asks.`
	"CN-18537" `	"Help the drones to learn to take care of the planets in this region."`
	"CN-18538" `	"Make sure the drones remain convinced that the Wanderers are on their side."`
	"CN-18539" `	"Maybe see if the drones will share their technology with us? They have impressive weapons."`
	"CN-18540" `	He says, "We will try to do that. But this, storing [plants, living things] in boxes made of metal, is not the Wanderer way. We seek to return worlds to their [natural, pristine] state, not to build our own [monuments, structures] on them."`
	"CN-18541" `	"Very well," he says, "we will do that. Please return to <planet> and see what our [leaders, elders] think should be done next."`
	"CN-18542" `	He doesn't seem enthusiastic about that suggestion. "Human," he says, "you have very different [priorities, goals] than we do. I am more [excited, intrigued] by the possibility of using these drones for [renewal, creation] than by their capacity for destruction."`
	"CN-18543" `	You return to your ship. It will be interesting to see what else has changed the next time you return to this world.`
	"CN-18544" `The mood among the Wanderer leaders is much lighter now that the danger from the Mereti drones appears to have been eliminated. In fact, they're now so intrigued by the emergent Mereti consciousness that they don't seem to be thinking about the more distant threat of the drones in Kor Sestor space. Instead, they want to focus on their true calling: terraforming planets.`
	"CN-18545" `	Sobari Tele'ek tells you, "We should take time to enjoy this [peace, respite]. We need not [face, deal with] the other drones immediately. We will be working to start a second [settlement, base] nearby. Visit us there when the base is [formed, established] and we will decide our next [actions, steps]. In the meantime, our latest ship of [war, defense] is now being produced on our [major, central] worlds, and you may buy one."`
	"CN-18546" `Most of the Wanderer elders have moved to this world, to be more involved in the newest terraforming effort, which they clearly find much more rewarding than the battle against the drones. After listening to them talk for nearly an hour about soil restoration and atmospheric particulates and carbon cycles, you ask what you can help them with next.`
	"CN-18547" `	Tema'a Iriket says, "We should take further action to [befriend, collaborate with] the Korath. Perhaps you could visit Rek, and [invite, welcome] her Korath friends to [witness, inspect] the work we are doing here? Our hope is that our next [settlement, project] will be a [joint effort?] with them."`
	"CN-18548" `	"What about dealing with the Sestor drones?"`
	"CN-18549" `	"There will be [time, opportunity] for that later," says Iriket. "They are not a [threat, pressing concern] to us at this time."`
	"CN-18550" `	You agree to visit the Kor Efreti and invite them to come back here for a visit.`
	"CN-18551" `Rek is making marvelous progress not only in learning the Korath language, but also in winning their trust. They have built her a Wanderer-style treehouse here to live in, and it seems that she is entertaining a constant stream of new visitors. "What can I help you with?" she asks.`
	"CN-18552" `	"The Wanderers on <planet> want to invite some Kor Efret leaders to visit them."`
	"CN-18553" `	"What is your impression of the Korath so far?"`
	"CN-18554" `	She says, "We Wanderers have seen the ruins left behind by so many failed species. It puzzles us greatly to wonder why some are able to transition to a strong and stable and sustainable civilization, as we have done, while others descend into chaos. The Kor Efret hope that what they build out of the ashes will finally be a society of true peace and prosperity."`
	"CN-18555" `	You tell her about the Wanderer invitation, and she takes you to visit some of the Korath leaders. They are eager to learn more about the Wanderers, but after some negotiation they make it clear that they would prefer to travel in one of their own ships, and with Rek as their guest, rather than going as your passengers.`
	"CN-18556" `	(Agree to escort their ship to <planet>.)`
	"CN-18557" `	"I think you might be safer if you travel aboard my ship."`
	"CN-18558" `	Rek talks with them for a while, then explains to you, "They want to be in control of their own journey, rather than being no more than 'living cargo' aboard an alien ship. It sounds like this is a matter of honor." Since it seems like the only option, you agree to let them follow you to <planet> in their own ship.`
	"CN-18559" `The Kor Efret ship lands next to yours, and Rek brings their leaders to meet with the Wanderers. They spend nearly the whole day being led around the settlement, asking questions and inspecting the Wanderer terraforming equipment. But at last, one of the Korath leaders says, "How long until we will see the change here? How long until it will be clear that your plans will work?"`
	"CN-18560" `	When Tema'a Iriket, translating through Rek, explains that it will take centuries, the leader says, "Can you show us a world where you have completed your work?"`
	"CN-18561" `	The Wanderers discuss that, and Tele'ek says, "They should [visit, journey to] <planet>, and be shown what we can achieve at the [apex, conclusion] of our work. Captain <last>, will you [accompany, lead] them to there?"`
	"CN-18562" `	"Are you sure it is safe to let them bring their ship to your homeworld?"`
	"CN-18563" `	Tele'ek says, "If we do not [choose, take a risk] to trust them, they will never have [opportunity, impetus] to show themselves trustworthy. So, we will take the [first, catalyzing] step."`
	"CN-18564" `	You agree to escort the Kor Efret ship on a journey through the wormhole to <planet>.`
	"CN-18565" `The Kor Efret are awed by the treetop villages, the towering buildings, and the bustling spaceport here on <origin>. But what moves them most deeply is the wild forests and mountains outside the city. After being led there by some of the local Wanderer leaders, they stand for half an hour just watching the trees swaying in the wind and the birds circling overhead. A few of them make a strange barking, keening noise, and Rek tells you they are weeping: mourning the fact that few places this beautiful and unspoiled are left on their own worlds.`
	"CN-18566" `	The Korath are eager to see more places of natural beauty like this one, and the Wanderer leaders suggest that they travel to <planet> next, to see how the Wanderers have built farms that will produce rich crops year after year without depleting the soil.`
	"CN-18567" `The Korath are very interested to see how the farms here work. "We are trying to learn to do this on our worlds," one of them explains, "but there has been blight, and drought, and crops that fail for reasons we do not even understand." The Wanderer scientists here do their best to explain how they keep the crops and the soil healthy, with Rek working hard to translate their technical jargon into terms that the Korath can understand.`
	"CN-18568" `	When they have completed their tour, Rek says to you in your own language, "<first>, I think we should show them <planet> next. We should show them the war with the Unfettered. If they see that we are few in number, embattled, with only a handful of worlds, they will feel less threatened by us."`
	"CN-18569" `	"That sounds like a good idea."`
	"CN-18570" `	"What if seeing you as less of a threat emboldens them to attack you?"`
	"CN-18571" `	Rek says, "We are still more numerous and more advanced. And besides, wars are started by fear as often as they are started by aggression."`
	"CN-18572" `	You agree to escort the Korath ship to <planet>. Hopefully they won't be blown to bits by an Unfettered fleet; that would be quite a diplomatic disaster.`
	"CN-18573" `The Korath ship lands safely on <origin>. Rek explains to the Korath that the entire Wanderer territory was once controlled by the Hai, but that the Hai ruined these worlds and abandoned them. She tells them that now that the Wanderers have completed their work of healing these worlds, they are returning them to the Hai.`
	"CN-18574" `	It's a somewhat slanted story, and the Korath are dubious. "If you have done them this great favor," one of them asks, "why are they attacking you?"`
	"CN-18575" `	Rek explains that the Hai wanted these worlds back before the Wanderers were ready to give them back, and the same Korath says, "So, if we allow you to spread to our worlds, you will return them to us not when we ask you to, but when you decide you are done?"`
	"CN-18576" `	Rek tries to assure them that in their own territory, they will be working and living side by side with the Wanderers, in joint control of their worlds. It's not clear if they believe her. "We have seen enough," says the same Korath. "We will return to our world now." You agree to escort them back through the Eye and to make sure they reach <planet> safely.`
	"CN-18577" `You have escorted the Korath world-ship safely back to their home. Hopefully what they saw on their journey will make them more eager to be friends with the Wanderers, rather than less. Rek hands you a written report that she says is an account of the diplomatic mission and says, "Please deliver this to Sobari Tele'ek on <planet>."`
	"CN-18578" `	"Okay, I'll do that."`
	"CN-18579" `	"Do you think the mission was a success?"`
	"CN-18580" `	"I hope so," she says. "The true test will be how we treat the Kor Efreti in the days to come. Clearly it will take some effort to earn their trust."`
	"CN-18581" `	You return to your ship, and get ready to travel to <planet>.`
	"CN-18582" `The Wanderers are eager to hear the results of your diplomatic mission, and whatever is in Rek's report seems to encourage them. Tele'ek says, "If we can [deal with, neutralize] the Kor Sestor drones as well, all of Korath space will be [open, available] for us and for the Korath survivors. Then there will be no more [barriers, impediments] to peace."`
	"CN-18583" `	"If you combined your fleet with the Kor Mereti, you could destroy the Kor Sestor drones outright."`
	"CN-18584" `	"If the Sestor drones are being controlled remotely, we should try to find the control station and take it over, or destroy it."`
	"CN-18585" `	"With great [destruction, loss] of life," says Tema'a Iriket. "That is not [acceptable, moral]. We should seek a more [subtle, elegant] solution."`
	"CN-18586" `	After some discussion, the Wanderers agree that the best way to deal with the Sestor drones is to try to figure out where their control center is. "Their communications are [untraceable, undetectable]," says Tele'ek, "but surely the [control center, communications hub] will be well defended. So by [hunting, searching] for a well defended [site, installation] we may find it."`
	"CN-18587" `	Iriket says, "I can supply Captain <last> with [surveying?] scanners and [ground-penetrating radar?] from the terraforming team. Such a [facility, installation] might well be deep underground."`
	"CN-18588" `	The Wanderers begin loading the scanning equipment onto your ship, and ask you to land on each of the planets in Kor Sestor space to collect measurements. "Bring the [data, results] back to us to be analyzed," says Iriket.`
	"CN-18589" `A few hours after you present the scanning data to the scientists, you are called into a meeting with the Wanderer leaders. "We may have found the [facility, center]," says, Tele'ek, "but we are not [certain, confident]. There is indeed an underground [bunker, fortress] on one of the planets, but it must have been [damaged, overrun] in the course of their war." He calls up a holographic display of the facility, showing that one section of it has been breached, and a tunnel leads from there to the surface.`
	"CN-18590" `	"You're probably right that they wouldn't have kept using the facility once it had been breached."`
	"CN-18591" `	"Is there any sign that they tried to rebuild it after the damage? Or that it's still in use?"`
	"CN-18592" `	Iriket walks up closer to the display to look on it. She adjusts some controls, and an overlay shows up in another color. "The Kor Efret said their [civil war, cultural collapse] ended a century ago, yes?" she asks. You nod. She walks around the display, examining it carefully, then says, "These [cracks, fractures] in the [bedrock?] have not yet been [infiltrated, saturated] with ground water. This damage is not a century old. It is from at most one [month?] ago."`
	"CN-18593" `	"Could it be that whoever was living down there decided to give up and return to the surface?"`
	"CN-18594" `	"Does that mean that someone else captured the facility before we could?"`
	"CN-18595" `	Suddenly, you hear the noise of alarm sirens from the spaceport, and a messenger comes bursting into the room, his talons screeching across the floor as he skids to a stop. "Sestor drones!" he says. "[Enormous, overwhelming] fleet. Need all [defenders, fighters] immediately."`
	"CN-18596" `	You return to your ship and quickly fire up the engines...`
	"CN-18597" `You return to the planet expecting the Wanderers to be celebrating their victory, but the leaders have grim news. "The drones we fought were only the [rearguard? remnant?] of the fleet," says Tele'ek. "Dozens of [capital ships?] passed through this system and continued on. With this [heading, destination]." On the holographic projector, he brings up a star map, and points to the system where the Eye is. The wormhole leading back to Wanderer space.`
	"CN-18598" `	Tele'ek says, "Every ship we can spare must [pursue, follow] the Sestor drones through the Eye, and hope that we [locate, track down] the drones before they can cause [harm, destruction] to our people." You should probably join them.`
	"CN-18599" `A major battle was fought here. The burned-out hulks of several Wanderer ships are floating around in space, along with a handful of disabled Kor Sestor ships. Meanwhile, Wanderer ships are engaged in some sort of rescue or evacuation process on the surface of Varu K'prai. But there is no sign of the bulk of the Kor Sestor fleet.`
	"CN-18600" `Quite a few Kor Sestor ships are in orbit around the anarchist world of Zenith, and you detect many more on the surface. Strangely, the Kor Sestor ships are not attacking the local pirate and anarchist fleets.`
	"CN-18601" `	That is probably not a good sign.`
	"CN-18602" `Everyone in the spaceport on Vara K'chrai is still in a panic from watching the Kor Sestor fleet fly through their system, but fortunately the drones did not attack the planet. In fact, they did not even fire on the Wanderer ships that were in orbit at the time. The Wanderer defenders, not wanting to provoke a fight with a fleet they could probably not defeat, did not attack either. So, the Kor Sestor fleet passed peacefully through this system and continued on to... wherever it is going. No one here has any idea yet what the fleet's destination was.`
	"CN-18603" `The defenders on <planet> have heard of the Kor Sestor incursion into Wanderer space, but they tell you that the fleet did not pass through this system. And here, they are clearly too worried about the Unfettered threat to be able to think about fighting a war on a second front at the same time.`
	"CN-18604" `The entire spaceport on <planet> has been razed to the ground. Teams of Wanderers are sifting through the rubble to recover the bodies of those who were killed here. Apparently the Kor Sestor fleet destroyed the spaceport and every Wanderer ship it found in this system, and then occupied the system for several days, destroying or driving away any scout ships that entered the system.`
	"CN-18605" `	The Wanderers don't know what happened next, but the drones are no longer here. Perhaps they have moved beyond Wanderer space.`
	"CN-18606" `As you bring your ship in for landing at an empty pad, you notice the captain of an adjacent Behemoth inspecting his ship, which is raked with projectile punctures.`
	"CN-18607" `	(Approach the captain and try to find out what happened.)`
	"CN-18608" `	You get a better view of the Behemoth - the Heart of Gold, as indicated on the ship's stern - as you walk up to it. The rear of the ship is badly hammered, and black scorch marks streak forward across the hull. You can't help but notice that at several projectile entry points along the hull, the metal is bent smoothly inwards, almost as if the penetrator seared or melted its way through the ship's armor. The captain of the Behemoth looks up from his inspection. Seeing you, he says, "We were lucky to get out of that one alive!"`
	"CN-18609" `	"How did your ship end up in such a state?"`
	"CN-18610" `	"Was this beauty the victim of a pirate attack?"`
	"CN-18611" `	"I'm not quite sure," the captain says. "We were shot at by a fleet of hostile ships that our computer couldn't identify. They didn't look at all like a run-of-the-mill pirate ship, though, and they were kitted out with tech I've never seen before."`
	"CN-18612" `	"How many ships were there? What did they look like?"`
	"CN-18613" `	"Where did this fight take place?"`
	"CN-18614" `	"You should be glad you're still in one piece."`
	"CN-18615" `	"Well," the pilot says, "we had hired a beefy Leviathan escort to Farpoint. When we were going in for landing, two of these hostile ships jumped in from the northwest, the direction of all the anarchist colonies in this area. The ships weren't big, but they were tough: our four Heavy Laser Turrets weren't enough to produce even a dent in their shields. They made short work of the Leviathan, and nearly disabled our ship, too. It was lucky I decided that jumping would be faster than landing. We warped out of the system while in atmosphere, saving the ship, but now I'm in debt to all my crew because I couldn't meet a rush delivery deadline. Still had to deliver the goods, but lost a pretty substantial bonus."`
	"CN-18616" `	"You're lucky as hell to be here today."`
	"CN-18617" `	"Thanks for the information. I think that these hostile ships are the ones I'm looking for."`
	"CN-18618" `	"Well," the pilot says, "we were on a deadline to do a large cargo run to Farpoint, when two of these hostile ships jumped in from the northwest, the direction of all the anarchist colonies in this area. I had to jump the ship in atmosphere to stop us from getting shredded by their strange melting weaponry. I immediately reported the attack to a desk clerk at the Navy base in the neighboring system Saiph, but their servers show no logs of any unidentified ships beyond Farpoint, so I guess they turned around after scouting out the Alnitak system. Just my luck to be in the system the moment those things entered, too, because I missed the delivery deadline. Still had to deliver the goods, but lost a pretty substantial bonus."`
	"CN-18619" `	"Thanks for the information. I think that these hostile ships are the ones I'm hunting."`
	"CN-18620" `	"I am! The attacking ships weren't big, but they were tough: our four Heavy Laser Turrets couldn't even produce a dent in their shields," the captain says. "We even hired a beefy Leviathan to protect us from the pirate raids as we traveled to Farpoint, but when these hostile ships jumped in from the northwest, they made short work of our escort and nearly disabled our ship, too. I had to jump out of the system while in atmosphere to save the ship, but now I'm in debt to all my crew because I didn't meet a rush delivery deadline. Still had to deliver the goods, but lost a pretty substantial bonus."`
	"CN-18621" `	"You really are lucky as hell to be here today."`
	"CN-18622" `	"No problem, kiddo," the captain says, although he looks awed that you are even attempting to fight such powerful ships. "Remember, northwest of Farpoint. If they're anarchists of any sort, they'll be hiding in one of those pirate systems up there. Take care of yourself out there; those are some dangerous ships that jumped us." With that, he bids you farewell.`
	"CN-18623" `	"Yeah, those ships would have obliterated us if we hadn't jumped pronto." The pilot looks at you, then asks quizzically, "Say, do you know anything about those ships?"`
	"CN-18624" `	"Yeah, those were Korath ships that attacked you."`
	"CN-18625" `	"Maybe. I have a feeling that they're the alien ships that I'm hunting."`
	"CN-18626" `	"I don't want to jump to any conclusions."`
	"CN-18627" `	"Aliens?" The pilot's face reddens, and his eyes narrow in anger. "Like those detestable squirrels, you mean? Told me they were peaceful, but when I went further north, I nearly had my ship torn to pieces!" You try to tell him that the Hai are a separate species from the Korath, but he clearly does not want to hear any more, so you decide to bring the conversation to an end.`
	"CN-18628" `	The pilot seems disappointed in your response, so you decide to bring the conversation to an end.`
	"CN-18629" `	"Thank you for your time," you say to the captain.`
	"CN-18630" `	The pilot sobers up again, and says, "No problem. Remember, northwest of Farpoint. If they're anarchists of any sort, they'll be hiding in one of those pirate systems up there. Take care of yourself out there; those were dangerous ships we faced." With that, he bids you farewell.`
	"CN-18631" `You've located the Kor Sestor fleet, in the Alnilam system. The Republic Navy is probably ill-equipped to fight such powerful alien ships, but they may be the only thing standing in the way of an outright invasion of human space. You should warn Admiral Danforth and the Oathkeepers of the impending threat as soon as possible.`
	"CN-18632" `As you are coming in for a landing, you contact Admiral Danforth and ask to speak with him as soon as possible. He meets you at the landing pad and invites you back to his office, where you explain about the large Kor Sestor fleet that is now gathering to the north of here. He tells you, "For the past several months, Intelligence has been tracking a hidden Alpha base on Zenith and making plans to trap and exterminate them. And now you tell me that Zenith is being guarded by Korath drones. It seems unlikely to be a coincidence."`
	"CN-18633" `	"Could the Kor Sestor have made some sort of deal with the Alphas?"`
	"CN-18634" `	"Maybe the Alphas gained control of the Kor Sestor fleet somehow?"`
	"CN-18635" `	"That would assume that some of the Korath who controlled the Sestor fleet are still alive," he says. "Is there evidence that that is the case?"`
	"CN-18636" `	You tell him about the underground bunker that the Wanderers discovered, and the signs that someone either recently departed from it, or recently infiltrated it from the surface. He says, "We already know that a group of Alphas was active in that region of space. You and I fought them there just recently, and failed to capture them. I bet that after they fled, they somehow gained access to the Kor Sestor bunker and took over control of the drone fleets."`
	"CN-18637" `	It is not particularly surprising when, a few seconds after he says that, an alarm siren begins to sound...`
	"CN-18638" `Admiral Danforth looks like he is still in shock from the carnage and loss of life in the battle that you just fought. "Please tell me that that was the entire drone fleet," he says.`
	"CN-18639" `	Sadly, you shake your head. "They have dozens of capital ships," you say. "That was probably just the vanguard of their fleet."`
	"CN-18640" `	Danforth sighs. "I got a taste of how powerful these Korath ships are during our attack on the previous Alpha base," he says. "I'm not sure I can stand up against a whole fleet of them. Our only hope may be the Quarg. They have a ringworld in Hai space. In fact, isn't that where we left your friend Elias?" You nod. "You should go there immediately," says Danforth. "Hopefully, you will be able to bring back help in time."`
	"CN-18641" `As you are coming in for a landing, you contact the Quarg and discover that Elias Hanover is indeed still living here. He meets you the moment you dock with the station, and you describe the situation. "This must be retaliation," he says. "They want to wipe Danforth and the Oathkeepers off the map to get revenge for him driving them out of their base on Avalon."`
	"CN-18642" `	He leaves to try to find help, and returns about fifteen minutes later. "I've got four Quarg ships who volunteered to help," he says. "That may not seem like a lot, but their ships pack quite a punch. And, they've offered some medical supplies as well, which they'll load onto your ship. Good luck, captain."`
	"CN-18643" `	You thank him for his assistance, and hurry to fire up your ship and return to human space. Hopefully Danforth's base has not already been overrun in your absence.`
	"CN-18644" `Danforth is still alive, and still holding out against the Alpha-controlled drones. After directing several recruits to unload the medical supplies, he tells you, "The Alpha base we've been watching on <planet> is buried deep underground. I'm hoping that the Alphas either don't know we're aware of their base's location, or have chosen to remain there anyway because it is so well defended. If the drones are being controlled from there, taking out the base might deactivate the drones."`
	"CN-18645" `	"Do you think your troops could capture the base?"`
	"CN-18646" `	"Do you have a plan for destroying the Alphas?"`
	"CN-18647" `	Danforth says, "The base is several kilometers underground. Before it was guarded by Sestor drones, we had a chance. We could have landed dozens of troop transports and fought our way inside, albeit with heavy losses. But now, I doubt our troops could even make it to the surface."`
	"CN-18648" `	As he is speaking, two Navy officers approach your ship with a hover-cart carrying something that looks a little bit like a retrofitted Typhoon Torpedo. They salute Danforth, and he tells them, "Put it aboard Captain <last>'s ship." Then he turns to you. "I'm going to give you the coordinates of the Alpha base," he says. "It's on the polar continent, deep under the ice. Fortunately there are no other human settlements nearby."`
	"CN-18649" `	He pauses, as if to resign himself to what he is about to command you to do, and then says, "Land on the planet, drop this device at the coordinates, and then get the hell out of there. You'll have fifteen seconds after you deploy the device to get at least a thousand kilometers away."`
	"CN-18650" `	"Wait, is this a nuke? I thought the Navy was too principled to use them."`
	"CN-18651" `	"Okay, I'll do what you say."`
	"CN-18652" `	"Just drop the damn thing and get out of there, fast," he says. Clearly he doesn't want to tell you anything more about the weapon's origin.`
	"CN-18653" `	Alarm sirens begin to sound. "Don't wait here to defend us," says Danforth. "Go straight to <planet> and deploy the device. It may be the only way you can save us."`
	"CN-18654" `Danforth wasn't joking when he said that the device may be your only chance. There are almost a dozen Sestor capital ships in the system, and countless smaller craft tearing the Navy to shreds.`
	"CN-18655" `Even the Quarg warships are having trouble with an opposing fleet this size. Perhaps a more powerful fleet could defeat the automata, but it would be a difficult battle.`
	"CN-18656" `You shove Danforth's device out the airlock at the coordinates he gave you, and immediately fire your ship's repulsors full blast to take you back up into orbit...`
	"CN-18657" `The way Danforth talked about the device he gave you made you assume that it was a nuclear bomb, but the explosion that rocks <origin> a few seconds after you depart is far too powerful for that. The light of the explosion is many times brighter than this system's sun. And unless your sensors are lying to you, there is now a crater near <origin>'s south pole that goes all the way down to the mantle. Lava is filling the hole, and the entire planet's crust is shifting and shivering in response.`
	"CN-18658" `	You are glad that no human settlements were near the explosion, but your sensors are picking up compression waves traveling along the whole planet's surface, bouncing across it again and again as the planet rings like a bell. Anyone who lived anywhere on <origin> just got hit by an earthquake of deadly proportions.`
	"CN-18659" `	You can only hope that it was worth it, and that the control station has indeed been destroyed.`
	"CN-18660" `The base on <planet> appears to have survived the attack, despite the Kor Sestor drones that were overhead. You meet with Danforth and tell him that you destroyed the Alpha base using the weapon he gave you.`
	"CN-18661" `	He says, "When you destroyed the base, the Sestor drones suddenly stopped acting as a unified fleet. A few stayed here, but most of them have spread throughout this sector of space, and we are receiving reports that they are attacking Navy and civilian ships indiscriminately. My own fleet is too damaged to do anything to stop them, but other Navy bases are sending in reinforcements. Can you join them to help eliminate the drones?"`
	"CN-18662" `	"Of course, I would be glad to."`
	"CN-18663" `	"Of course. But first, what the hell was that bomb you had me drop on Zenith? It cracked the whole planet open."`
	"CN-18664" `	Danforth sighs. "Unfortunately," he says, "I am not permitted to tell you what that weapon was or how we acquired it. And already news agencies throughout the Republic are questioning our use of such a terrible weapon. I wish we had been able to defeat the Kor Sestor fleet without resorting to such extreme measures, but we had no choice."`
	"CN-18665" `	Danforth gives you a map of the systems where there have been reports of Kor Sestor drones attacking civilian ships. "These, plus any that were left alive in the Alnilam system, are all the automata that we have been able to track," he says. "Report back here once you have succeeded in completely destroying them. We can't risk letting some local warlord capture them. The Navy will hopefully send some ships to help you."`
	"CN-18666" `You check in with Danforth, but he tells you that there are still reports of Kor Sestor drones in human space. "You'll have to be sure to destroy them completely," he says. "We can't risk letting some local warlord capture them."`
	"CN-18667" `When you return to <planet>, Danforth tells you, "It seems that you have dealt with the last of the Kor Sestor drones that were terrorizing Republic space, but we still need to deal with the fleet in the Alnilam system. Do you think you can destroy that fleet on your own?"`
	"CN-18668" `	"Yes, I think I can manage it."`
	"CN-18669" `	"Are any of your ships repaired yet? I could use some assistance."`
	"CN-18670" `	He agrees to send some Oathkeeper ships with you to destroy the remaining drones, but it is clear that it pains him to risk the last few ships he has that are still spaceworthy.`
	"CN-18671" `Danforth breathes a sigh of relief when you tell him that the last of the Kor Sestor drones have been destroyed. "I am grateful for your help, Captain <last>," he says. "And now that we have finished with that battle, the public relations nightmare over what we did to Zenith begins. We don't need you to get involved in that, though; perhaps you should return to Wanderer space until things cool down a bit around here."`
	"CN-18672" `Danforth is impressed that you were able to eliminate the attacking Kor Sestor fleet. "The weapon I gave you was a last resort, and one that I would be ashamed to use," he says. "I have no ships to give you until we have had time to make repairs, but if you are able to destroy whatever Kor Sestor ships remain in the Alnilam system on your own, return here and I will send my troop transports with you to destroy the Alpha base the old-fashioned way."`
	"CN-18673" `You tell Danforth that you have destroyed the entire Kor Sestor fleet, without needing to bomb <planet>. He is impressed, and grateful. "I'll send some troop transports with you to take out the Alpha base," he says. "It is riskier destroying it this way, but at least the civilians on <planet> will not be harmed."`
	"CN-18674" `	"Understood. We'll go directly to <planet>."`
	"CN-18675" `	"The anarchist settlers, you mean? You're willing to lose your own troops just to avoid harming the anarchists and pirates by bombing their planet?"`
	"CN-18676" `	Danforth says, "If we had used such a terrible weapon on an inhabited planet, even an anarchist one, it would have sullied the good name of the Navy. Compared to that, the loss of a few Navy lives is acceptable, and the troops who volunteered for this mission are willing to risk their lives for that cause."`
	"CN-18677" `	You return to your ship and prepare to escort the troop transports to <planet>.`
	"CN-18678" `Danforth's troops set up a defensive circle around the entrance to the Alpha base. It appears that they have achieved the element of surprise: the Alphas did not know that the Navy had already located their base, and were probably counting on having a longer time to evacuate. The troop transports were carrying concrete mixers and mining drills; apparently their plan is to seal the Alphas underground and then drill down through the ice and bedrock to bomb and collapse the bunker.`
	"CN-18679" `	As the Navy troops begin pouring the concrete, the massive gate to the tunnel bursts open and more Alphas than you have ever seen in one place come flooding out, several dozen of them. But even these superhuman soldiers cannot survive the concentrated firepower of hundreds of Navy troops. The air fills with explosions and smoke and powdered snow, but as far as you can tell not one of the Alphas escapes alive.`
	"CN-18680" `	When the battle is over, the Navy troops explore the bunker, hoping to find prisoners, but they find no one alive. They seal up the entrance and collapse the bunker, and prepare to travel back with you to <planet>.`
	"CN-18681" `The Navy officers report the results of the battle on Zenith's surface to Danforth. "So it's over," he says. "Captain <last>, thank you for your assistance. This battle would have gone very differently if you were not here."`
	"CN-18682" `	Now that the Kor Sestor fleet has been dealt with, you should probably return and see how things are going for the Wanderers in Korath space.`
	"CN-18683" `You are pleased to discover that the Wanderer colony here has grown into a small city; about a hundred thousand Wanderers have already come through the Eye to settle here. Sobari Tele'ek meets you in the spaceport. He has lost half of his feathers - his whole face is bare and scaly - but rather than wasting away like Rek he has gained considerable weight, and now towers over you.`
	"CN-18684" `	He tells you, "Our Mereti [friends, kinsfolk] tell us that the Kor Sestor have become less [aggressive, warlike] of late. The factories on their worlds are still [producing, churning out] drones, but they no longer act with a [unified will? purpose?]."`
	"CN-18685" `	"Do you think they are weakened enough that we can destroy them?"`
	"CN-18686" `	"Do you think there is any way we could regain control of them?"`
	"CN-18687" `	"Probably," he says, "but we would prefer a more [elegant, peaceful] solution if possible. Would you be willing to [visit, observe] their star systems again, and collect [data, measurements] that might help us to learn to control them or shut them down?"`
	"CN-18688" `	"That is our [hope, desire]," he says. "Or, barring that, at least we may [disable, shut down] the factories. Would you be willing to [visit, observe] their star systems again, and collect [data, measurements] on the drones?"`
	"CN-18689" `	"What about the Kor Mereti drones? Have they remained peaceful?"`
	"CN-18690" `	"Indeed," he says. "And, they have brought much [entertainment? novelty?] to us. You should [visit, call on] them when you have time; they are very fond of you."`
	"CN-18691" `	Tele'ek introduces you to the team of scientists who will tackle the problem of shutting down the Kor Sestor factories. They explain to you that they are looking for any identifying information on the drones, including the alloy composition of their hulls and prevalence of blast marks or other signs of age. That will allow them to estimate how quickly the drones are being produced.`
	"CN-18692" `You give your scanner logs to the Wanderer scientists. A few hours later, you are called in to a meeting of the leaders. Sobari Tele'ek tells you, "Our scientists noted that the most recently constructed drones all have very similar [alloy composition?] and identification numbers. We suspect that means that they are all being produced on a single world, perhaps even a single [factory, facility]."`
	"CN-18693" `	He pulls up a star map and says, "Based on your previous geological scans, we [believe, deduce] that the factory is on this world, Sestor Ikfar. It would be easy enough to [destroy, eliminate] the facility, but Tema'a Iriket has a different proposal."`
	"CN-18694" `	Iriket stands up and says, "I propose that we use this as an [excuse, justification] for a visit to the Korath [exiles, outcasts]. We offer them the chance to [help, assist] us in ending the [scourge, plague] that they started. By [allying with, fighting alongside] us, they will come to view us as [friends, coworkers]."`
	"CN-18695" `	"Why get them involved if you think you can handle this on your own?"`
	"CN-18696" `	"Wait, you want to ask them for help just so they can feel good about themselves?"`
	"CN-18697" `	"That does sound like a good way to solve two problems at the same time."`
	"CN-18698" `	Tele'ek says, "The exiles must [feel, be aware of] their loss of [agency? significance?] in the galaxy. If we [plant, instill] a sense of purpose and [worth, importance] in them, they may become [peaceful, wise] just as the Kor Mereti collective did."`
	"CN-18699" `	Tele'ek says, "Nothing [forges, solidifies] a friendship as quickly as fighting a [common foe?]. And, we [feel, perceive, project] that the reason the exiles engage in [raiding, piracy] is that their society has no greater [purpose, goal] than mere survival. By involving them in the [restoration, healing] of their lands, we will give them [agency? significance?] and they will be free to be [peaceful, wise]."`
	"CN-18700" `	After more discussion the Wanderer leaders reach a consensus that they would like you to travel with Rek to the territory of the Korath exiles and seek to make contact with them. It seems like a very optimistic plan, but then again, the Wanderer approach of seeking friendship worked quite well with the Mereti drones.`
	"CN-18701" `Surprisingly, Rek is less enthusiastic about the diplomatic plan than the other Wanderer leaders were. "Of course I greatly desire to make contact with the exiles," she says, "but it is not safe to assume that the minds of an alien species works the same as our own. These Korath were exiled due to their endless, fruitless war-making. I'm not sure an offer of friendship and a small ego boost is all they need to make them become peaceful."`
	"CN-18702" `	"Do you think we should cancel the mission and just deal with the Sestor ourselves?"`
	"CN-18703" `	"Perhaps not, but isn't it better to try for peace while we have the chance?"`
	"CN-18704" `	"No," says Rek, "the leaders are right, we must offer them our trust until they prove utterly unworthy of it. But you should not be surprised if they are more interested in destroying you than in listening to me."`
	"CN-18705" `	"It is not only better," says Rek, "it is a moral imperative. Our first interaction with the exiles must be an offer of trust, not an act of war. But you should not be surprised if they are more interested in destroying you than in listening to me."`
	"CN-18706" `	Rek makes herself comfortable in one of your bunk rooms, and you prepare for a visit to the territory of the Korath exiles. "We must somehow earn their trust," she says, "so do not fire on any of their ships. Instead we must find a way to communicate with them or a place where they will meet with us peacefully."`
	"CN-18707" `The Korath ships tail you to the planet's surface, but they do not fire on you. Instead, they hover above your ship for a long, indecisive moment. You hold your fire, and they eventually land in the sand next to you. Their airlocks open, and a few of them step out and approach your ship. They do not appear to be armed. Perhaps they have a cultural taboo against using weapons on this world.`
	"CN-18708" `	(Go outside to meet them.)`
	"CN-18709" `	(Leave the planet while I still can.)`
	"CN-18710" `	The Korath seem surprised when you and Rek, two members of obviously different species, step off your ship side by side. They mutter quietly amongst themselves as you approach, then nearly jump in surprise when Rek addresses them in their own language.`
	"CN-18711" `	They converse with Rek for a while, and then Rek explains, "I told them that we hope to eliminate the infection of self-replicating war machines that they left behind, and make their territory safe for habitation once more. They say they are glad we have not destroyed the drones, because they are proud of their handiwork. They say they have command codes for the Sestor factories, to shut them down. But, they will not give the codes to us; they must go and enter them in person."`
	"CN-18712" `	"What are they asking for in return?"`
	"CN-18713" `	Rek says, "They request a meeting with our leaders, to work out terms of trade for our mutual benefit. It is something we would certainly agree to with no difficulty."`
	"CN-18714" `	Rek speaks with the Korath again, and then tells you, "They say that three of their 'world-ships' will travel with us to meet with the Wanderer leaders. If they are able to work out favorable terms, and are convinced that the Wanderers have peaceful intentions, they will go with us to the Sestor factory world and shut it down."`
	"CN-18715" `Rek brings the Korath to meet with the Wanderer leaders. After the meeting ends, she and Tele'ek meet up with you. "That was a strange meeting," says Rek. "It did not feel like a peace summit, but like a child's play at a peace summit, as if negotiating for peace is a skill they are only just beginning to learn. And the terms they asked for were minimal; I would have preferred to offer them far more. But they are taking steps toward becoming a peaceful society, and for that we can be grateful."`
	"CN-18716" `	"Are you sure that they really want peace? They aren't trying to trick you?"`
	"CN-18717" `	Rek says, "It is hard to be sure. Their culture is very different from the Kor Efret; even some of their language and gestures are new to me. But they have behaved peacefully toward us so far; we must hope that their peacefulness continues."`
	"CN-18718" `	Tele'ek says, "You must bring the [exile, outcast] ships to <planet> and keep them from being destroyed by the drones [along the way?]. There, they will [attempt, accomplish] what they have promised, and shut down the factories. Your only role will be to [shield, protect] them, and we will give you some of our warships to [assist, accompany] you." He gestures with a straggly, slightly misshapen wing towards a number of Wanderer vessels being loaded with supplies and prepared for battle. You notice a type of weapon you don't recognize mounted on some of them.`
	"CN-18719" `	"Are those ships carrying a new type of weapon?"`
	"CN-18720" `	"Sounds like a good plan. Let's get going!"`
	"CN-18721" `	Tele'ek seems pleased that you noticed. "Indeed. They are more [useful, effective] against hull armor than shields, [perfect, appropriate] for use against the Kor Sestor vessels alongside our [existing, previous] armaments." He pauses before continuing. "[Hopefully, If this goes well], they will not get much use, but will see you [safely, successfully] through this [mission, task] to finally end this [blight, menace]. However, we will have them [ready, prepared] if the need does [arise, return]."`
	"CN-18722" `	"Can I get some for my own ship?"`
	"CN-18723" `	"Is it a good idea to show off these new weapons to the Korath Exiles when making overtures of friendship?"`
	"CN-18724" `	"I look forward to seeing them in action. I should get my ship ready for to go."`
	"CN-18725" `	Tele'ek gestures towards Rek who says, "I raised a similar concern, but in this case, I [recognize, accept] that the benefit outweighs possible risks."`
	"CN-18726" `	Tele'ek explains, "If they view these weapons as signs of [aggression?] against themselves, there is little I can do for them. Their ships are not as [durable, well-armored] as the Kor Sestor automata, so our other technologies would already be [effective, damaging] enough if used against them. If they are [rational, intelligent], they will value the added protection on this [journey, endeavor]."`
	"CN-18727" `	"We have not yet produced many, but they will be [available, present] in our outfitters soon."`
	"CN-18728" `	You and Rek say goodbye to Tele'ek before returning to your ship, and preparing it for the trip to <planet>.`
	"CN-18729" `The drones stop firing on the Korath ships the moment they enter the atmosphere, which is a good sign - it probably means that their command codes worked. While they begin scouting out the manufacturing center, the exiles tell you (through Rek) that they need you to return to orbit and keep the remaining drones from attacking them until they can be sure the factory is shut down for good; it might take them a while to accomplish that.`
	"CN-18730" `	You fire up your engines and blast off for one last battle against the Kor Sestor...`
	"CN-18731" `As you come in for a landing, the Korath exiles inform you that they have succeeded in disabling the factories. They tell you that they will be returning to their territory on their own; now that their job is done, they no longer need you to "chaperone" them, as Rek translates it. You wish them luck, and they depart.`
	"CN-18732" `	The factory district does indeed seem to have been shut down: no more hum of machinery or flashes of arc-welders or smokestacks belching steam into the atmosphere. In fact, on closer inspection you realize that they did not merely shut down the factories; they have also removed some critical components from them.`
	"CN-18733" `	Rek asks, "Does it look like they succeeded?"`
	"CN-18734" `	"Yes, the factories are shut down."`
	"CN-18735" `	"It looks like they disassembled the factories and took some of the parts with them."`
	"CN-18736" `	"Oh," says Rek, "that is slightly ominous. But they are scavengers after all; perhaps they simply did not wish to leave useful machinery to rust."`
	"CN-18737" `	With nothing else to do here, you get ready to return to <planet> and report to the Wanderer leaders.`
	"CN-18738" `When you meet with the Wanderer leaders, Sobari Tele'ek tells you, "We have received word from our [scouts, observers] that the Sestor drones are [dwindling, reducing] in numbers and will soon be no more. We owe you our [gratitude, thanks]. But, the Mereti tell us a more worrisome [tale, story]." You notice that although he has grown larger, he appears to be having trouble standing upright, and hence his head is at roughly the same height as yours.`
	"CN-18739" `	Meto Pa'aret says, "The Mereti [contacted, communicated with] me and said that one of their stations was [raided, infiltrated] by the Korath exiles, and some of their [machinery, equipment] was stolen. The Mereti did not [fight, attack] the exiles because they thought they were [friends, allies]. Captain <last>, can you bring Rek to visit the [exiles, outcasts] and learn what their plans are?"`
	"CN-18740" `	"Could the stolen equipment make it possible for them to build a drone fleet of their own?"`
	"CN-18741" `	"That is what we are afraid of," says Tele'ek. You agree to travel to the territory of the exiles and see if there is any evidence that they are building war drones there.`
	"CN-18742" `You inform the Wanderers that the Korath exiles are now producing war drones. "This is [unfortunate, regrettable]," says Sobari Tele'ek. "Clearly they [anticipate, expect] further conflict in the future."`
	"CN-18743" `	Tema'a Iriket says, "Perhaps they are [afraid of, threatened by] us and seek only to have the means to [defend, protect] themselves. The important thing is that the drones in this [territory, area] have been [neutralized, pacified] and we can now focus on our true work."`
	"CN-18744" `	From there, the conversation shifts to an excited discussion about what worlds they will settle on next and what their next steps should be in building relationships with the Kor Efret and the Kor Mereti collective. The exiles may become a threat some time in the future, but for now the Wanderers are eager to pursue their peacetime calling in this new territory that the Eye has led them to.`
	"CN-18745" `All the other worlds belonging to this species have appeared unwilling to let you land, but here you find a slightly warmer welcome. A cloud of small, highly maneuverable patrol ships takes off from the planet as you approach and herds you onto one particular landing pad where, after a few minutes, several of the aliens approach your ship.`
	"CN-18746" `	This species is birdlike, but with bodies nearly as large as yours, and with wings that tower above you. They come swooping down from the sky, circle your ship to inspect it, and then land near the hatch and wait for you to open it. They do not appear to be armed, but their talons are eight or nine centimeters long.`
	"CN-18747" `	Hesitantly, you open your hatch and greet them. One of the aliens speaks to you: a chirping, clicking noise. You have no idea what it is saying.`
	"CN-18748" `	"Hello. I come in peace."`
	"CN-18749" `	"My name is <first>. I am glad to meet you."`
	"CN-18750" `	The alien leans forward as you speak, as if trying to decipher your words. "Iyik'ka'ak kareek elik, ek karu karai kavet," it says. You shake your head to indicate that you do not understand, and again try to speak to it in your own language. Again it leans forward as if deeply focused on what you are saying.`
	"CN-18751" `	The other aliens standing beside it are inspecting you with equal curiosity. Finally, one of them says to the leader, "Ek kalek kiro suk i'hai, sek speru siyek ka'hai esek'ru fer'ek." The leader gestures in response, turning up open palms, and the second alien steps forward and addresses you in an entirely different language, one that does not sound like birdsong at all. In fact, judging by the difficulty it seems to be having in trying to speak it, you suspect that it is the language of a different species entirely. Unfortunately, it is no more comprehensible to you than the bird's own language.`
	"CN-18752" `	They make some further attempts to communicate with you, but without success. Eventually they give up and all but the leader leaves. The leader makes a sweeping gesture to the rest of the spaceport, apparently inviting you to explore.`
	"CN-18753" `As before, you are ushered to the ground by a flock of the small alien ships, and a few of them fly over to your ship and wait for your to come out and try to talk to them. Also as before, you do not recognize their language and they do not understand yours, although their leader seems to be focused intently on trying to understand you.`
	"CN-18754" `	The other aliens standing beside it are inspecting you with equal curiosity. Finally, one of them says to the leader, "Ek kalek kiro suk i'hai, sek speru siyek ka'hai esek'ru fer'ek." The leader gestures in response, turning up open palms, and the second alien steps forward and begins speaking in an entirely different language. After a moment, you are startled to realize that it is speaking the language of the Hai. The difficulty it has producing the sounds lends it a rather coarse accent, but it is almost certainly Hai.`
	"CN-18755" `	"Hai, you speak the Hai language?" you ask. You cup your hands above your ears to mimic the large, rodent-like ears of the Hai.`
	"CN-18756" `	"Iy, ka'hai!" says the alien, rustling their wings in what you take as a gesture of excitement, "Speru ek ka'hai?" At the same time, though, one of the other aliens takes a step back and flexes their talons at you. It occurs to you that the Hai may or may not be viewed favorably here.`
	"CN-18757" `	"Sorry, I don't speak their language."`
	"CN-18758" `	"Are there any Hai here?"`
	"CN-18759" `	The same alien speaks again, pantomiming your ship flying into the sky and then returning, and then points to your airlock and mimics your rodent-ear gesture for the Hai. You think they are telling you to go find one of the Hai who can serve as an interpreter, and bring them back here.`
	"CN-18760" `The aliens north of Hai space seem to speak the Hai language. Do you want to look for someone here who could serve as an interpreter?`
	"CN-18761" `	(No; the other Hai south of here are better suited for this.)`
	"CN-18762" `	You search around the spaceport for any sign of a local government. Eventually, one of the Hai approaches you. "You are lost, monkey. What is it that you are looking for?"`
	"CN-18763" `	"Do you know where I can talk to an official?"`
	"CN-18764" `	"Do you know where I could find an interpreter?"`
	"CN-18765" `	"I'm doing fine, thank you."`
	"CN-18766" `	The Hai says, "If your reason for talking to our chiefs is worthwhile, then I will take you to them."`
	"CN-18767" `	"I'm looking for a Hai interpreter," you say.`
	"CN-18768" `	She looks back at you quizzically. "What purpose would an interpreter serve? You can understand my words, can you not?"`
	"CN-18769" `	"I need one to talk to the aliens up north from here."`
	"CN-18770" `	"I think that I'll be better off finding one of the chiefs on my own."`
	"CN-18771" `	The Hai scrunches up her nose. "Foolish monkey. We have already contacted those aliens; we have little use for another emissary."`
	"CN-18772" `	"Can you still provide an interpreter, though?"`
	"CN-18773" `	"You do not need an interpreter. All you need is to know that those aliens are not worth conversing with."`
	"CN-18774" `	The Hai walks away, leaving you to your own devices in the spaceport.`
	"CN-18775" `	The Hai scoffs at you. "If you do not seek for help, or seek to help, then you have no place on our worlds." She walks away, and you spend another hour searching the spaceport before giving up and heading back to your ship.`
	"CN-18776" `	You manage to contact the local governor's office, but when you speak with the governor he says, "First contact? Human, this is not a task for just any Hai. You must go to our home world, where an official ambassador can join you. I will contact them and tell them to expect you."`
	"CN-18777" `As you are approaching Hai-home, you contact the Hai government and ask if they would be willing to provide an ambassador to help you communicate with the aliens to the north, who seem to speak the Hai language. They immediately direct you to a private government hangar, where a diplomat meets you. She holds out a paw to greet you, and says, "My name is Sayari. I was the envoy to the human government, a century ago."`
	"CN-18778" `	To the best of your knowledge, the Republic has never mentioned the Hai or publicly acknowledged receiving an envoy from them.`
	"CN-18779" `	"Wait, the human Republic knows that the Hai exist? I had heard nothing but vague rumors of your existence before I found the wormhole."`
	"CN-18780" `	"Wait, the human Republic knows that the Hai exist?"`
	"CN-18781" `	"I'm pleased to meet you. Are you willing to travel with me?"`
	"CN-18782" `	She laughs, in the Hai manner: a rapid chittering sound. "Yes, the humans and the Hai both worried that too many humans would emigrate all at once if they knew of our peaceful lands. So we agreed that the Hai would be a secret, always here for the adventurous to discover, but difficult to find, so that the human immigration would be slow enough for us to gradually adjust to it."`
	"CN-18783" `	"Are you the translator who will travel with me?" you ask.`
	"CN-18784" `	"Yes," she says. "If these aliens will provide a place for me, I mean to live with them permanently, an ambassador between their people and ours. I am old, and in need of a great novelty like this to make my life interesting once more." You note that the fur on her face, especially on the snout, has turned from brown to silvery gray - a sign of age in terrestrial creatures, and perhaps in the Hai as well.`
	"CN-18785" `	"I'm glad to have the company of such a distinguished ambassador. Let's go visit these aliens immediately!"`
	"CN-18786" `	"What if the humans want our own envoy to these aliens?"`
	"CN-18787" `	She says, "If they prove to be friendly, I will help you to find a way to communicate with them directly, so you need not use me as an intermediary. But our first step must be to speak with them." You help her aboard your ship, and get ready to return to the alien homeworld.`
	"CN-18788" `Once again, the Wanderers allow you to land, but with a large flock of their light warships surrounding you to herd you into a particular landing zone. A small delegation of Wanderers meets you and Sayari, whom they greet hesitantly in the Hai language. She responds, and a heated exchange follows. You do not understand any of what they are saying.`
	"CN-18789" `	(Ask her what they are talking about.)`
	"CN-18790" `	(Wait for a break in the conversation.)`
	"CN-18791" `	She holds up a paw to you while speaking a few more sentences to them, then says, "They are saying that the Hai are attacking them, and they want to know why. It must be the Unfettered who are raiding them, and I am trying to explain that the Unfettered do not represent the Hai people as a whole."`
	"CN-18792" `	They continue talking for a while, and then the Wanderers ask you a question. Sayari translates, "They want to know what humans want, and why you have come to their territory."`
	"CN-18793" `	"I'm just an individual explorer. I don't represent my species or their governments."`
	"CN-18794" `	"My hope is that our species might both benefit from trading goods and technologies with each other."`
	"CN-18795" `	"I believe that different species should communicate with each other rather than remaining in forced isolation."`
	"CN-18796" `	They respond, and Sayari translates, "They say that like you, they are travelers, and this region of space is not their home, so they will gladly welcome other sojourners here. But they warn you that if you betray their trust, you will not find that trust easy to regain. They also say..." She pauses as the Wanderers speak again, then continues translating. "They say that in their travels, they have met few species truly capable of living in peace, and they hope that yours is one of them, because..." Again she pauses as the Wanderers speak, then says, "Because, they hate to make new friends only to lose them again."`
	"CN-18797" `	They respond, and Sayari translates, "They say that they would perhaps be willing to trade with you, although to form a broader trade agreement with humans would be a serious decision and one they cannot make lightly." She pauses to listen again, and then continues, "They also say that they will discuss among themselves whether you should be given access to Wanderer technology, but again, that will not be a swiftly made decision." She pauses as the Wanderers speak again, then continues translating. "They say that in their travels, they have met few species truly capable of living in peace, and they hope that yours is one of them, because..." Again she pauses as the Wanderers speak, then says, "Because, they hate to make new friends only to lose them again."`
	"CN-18798" `	They respond, and Sayari translates, "They say that their species has encountered many other species in the past, and always has found those encounters to be valuable. Although..." She pauses to listen as the Wanderers continue speaking. "Although, they say that in their travels, far more often than they encounter living species, they instead only find themselves sifting through the refuse of a species that has destroyed itself through war or carelessness. They hope that you are not such a species, because..." Again she pauses as the Wanderers speak, then says, "Because, they hate to make new friends only to lose them again."`
	"CN-18799" `	Speaking through Sayari, you try to reassure the Wanderers that you have peaceful intentions. They speak with her for a while longer. She tells you, "They say that I will be allowed to stay here as an ambassador, and they will also let you land on most of their worlds. But they will not welcome any other Hai into their territory. I fear that they distrust the Hai because of the actions of the Unfettered, and being associated with me may harm your chances to win their favor. For your sake, we should find a different way for you to communicate with them."`
	"CN-18800" `	"How can we do that?"`
	"CN-18801" `	She says, "There are scientists on the Hai world of <planet> who develop speaking machines, to allow the Hai who do not know the human language to communicate with humans. I will write a letter asking them to give you one of these speaking machines, so that you may talk with the Wanderers without needing me as an intermediary."`
	"CN-18802" `You land on <origin> and seek out the technologist that Sayari told you to contact: a Hai named Eruk. His eyes light up when you describe what you need from him, and why. "Contact with a new species! How very exciting," he says. "I am glad for Sayari that such an opportunity has been presented to her. But our speaking machines are very valuable. Before I give one to you, will you do a small favor for me?"`
	"CN-18803" `	"Of course. What do you need?"`
	"CN-18804" `	"Can't I just pay you for one?"`
	"CN-18805" `	He says, "The human immigrants tell me that in the region of your space they call the Deep is a space station, a library that houses human cultural artifacts and a database of human literature and history. Bring me a copy of that database, and I will give you a speaking machine."`
	"CN-18806" `	"Money?" he says, with a dismissive gesture. "What use is money? No, from you I desire something far more valuable. The human immigrants tell me that in the region of your space they call the Deep is a space station, a library that houses human cultural artifacts and a database of human literature and history. Bring me a copy of that database, and I will give you a speaking machine."`
	"CN-18807" `	"No problem, I'll bring you a copy of the database as soon as I can."`
	"CN-18808" `	"How will I convince them to give me a copy of their data?"`
	"CN-18809" `	Your question seems to utterly confuse him. "Information," he says. "It is what you call a non-rival good, is it not? When I give information, I do not lose it. Sharing it costs me nothing. The librarians, surely they will understand this. Have no fear."`
	"CN-18810" `	"I actually already have a copy of that data."`
	"CN-18811" `	"You do? Please go get it!" he exclaims.`
	"CN-18812" `	You go to your ship to retrieve the data and give it to him upon returning. His eyes light up with excitement as he makes a copy of the card and returns the original to you.`
	"CN-18813" `You return to Eruk's workshop and give him the data card. His eyes light up with excitement as he makes a copy of the card and returns the original to you.`
	"CN-18814" `	"I have spent my whole life studying human culture," he says. "This is a treasure to me. And now, here is your speaking machine." He hands you a small, spherical device, with speakers and microphones mounted on it, as well as what look like camera lenses. "The device is programmed with the human and Hai languages," he says. "It is not always possible to translate perfectly between our two languages, but it will try to give you a sense of the range of meanings in what is being said."`
	"CN-18815" `	"Thank you. I'm eager to try it out!"`
	"CN-18816" `	"Is there anything else I need to know?"`
	"CN-18817" `	He humors you by demonstrating how the machine works, holding a conversation with you where he speaks in the Hai language, and the machine automatically translates for you and then translates your responses back into his language. It apparently uses its cameras to track who you are speaking to or listening to. It's an impressive piece of technology, and easy enough to use. You thank him for his help, and return to your ship.`
	"CN-18818" `You had wondered how you would get a copy of the entire cultural archive, but it turns out to be easier than expected. The station has a small museum gift shop, which sells a copy of the archives on a data card. ("The perfect gift for the budding historian in your family! Hold all of human history in the palm of your hand. On sale now for only 39.99!") Given that a cheap data card costs a fraction of a credit, it's a bit of a rip-off, but you gladly buy one to take back to Eruk.`
	"CN-18819" `With the help of your new translation device, you are able to contact the Wanderer government. They welcome you back and tell you that a Wanderer named "Iktat Rek" has been appointed as the official envoy to deal with human visitors, and he should be arriving at your landing pad shortly.`
	"CN-18820" `	Rek is slightly larger than most of the Wanderers you have seen, with muted white and brown plumage and a calm, dignified bearing. "It is very [rare, exceptional] in our history that we have to [deal with, cope with] other species," he says, "and now we find ourselves dealing with two at once." He is speaking the Hai language, and the translation device does its best to render his words in your own language.`
	"CN-18821" `	"How did you learn the Hai language?"`
	"CN-18822" `	"How long have you been fighting the Unfettered Hai?"`
	"CN-18823" `	"It has been nearly twenty [years, cycles] now," he says. "At first only a single Hai ship [visited, invaded] us, but back then we had no defenses in place to stop it. For years the ship only [harvested, stole] food from our frontier worlds, and avoided combat. In our culture it is an [obligation, duty] to share our food with one who [asks for, demands] it, so we did not oppose the Hai ship. But then more Hai ships came, attacked one of our worlds and took it for themselves, and killed many of our people. We built warships and drove them back, and yet their [raids, attacks] still continue."`
	"CN-18824" `	"Recently we managed to [take, capture] some of them as prisoners," he says. "They have been [raiding, visiting] us for twenty [years, cycles]. At first they only stole unguarded stores of food, and fled if we approached. We allowed them to take it, because in our culture it is a [duty, obligation] to share our food with those who [ask for, demand] it. But recently they have become far more [aggressive, desperate]. They captured one of our worlds and killed many Wanderers, and we built warships and drove them back. Some of them tried to hide on the planet, and we made them our [prisoners, guests] and slowly learned their language."`
	"CN-18825" `	"Do you know what the Unfettered want?" you ask.`
	"CN-18826" `	"They want food, and [land, elbowroom]," says Rek. "This we guessed when they first raided us, and the Hai named Sayari has confirmed this to me, that the Unfettered have [squandered, consumed] their own worlds and now make war to gain others."`
	"CN-18827" `	"What is the history of your species?"`
	"CN-18828" `	"How long have the Wanderers been in this region of space?"`
	"CN-18829" `	"It is now nearly ten thousand [years, cycles] since we passed through the Eye and entered this [region, territory]," he says.`
	"CN-18830" `	"We are an ancient people," he says. "This [region, territory] is not our homeland. We came here through the Eye nearly ten thousand [years, cycles] ago."`
	"CN-18831" `	"The Eye?" you ask.`
	"CN-18832" `	"A wormhole," he says. "Once in an [eon, era] the Eye opens, and the Wanderers journey through it to a new home. Since the time of our oldest [history, legends] it has been so. A hundred times, maybe a thousand, we have left one home and journeyed to another. Each new home the Eye brings us to is full of [devastation, destruction], and it takes many lifetimes to set things right. Then the Eye beckons again, and we move on. And each time we pass through the Eye we become something new."`
	"CN-18833" `	"Why would you travel through the wormhole, if you are leaving fruitful worlds you have worked hard to develop, and only ruined worlds await you on the other side?"`
	"CN-18834" `	"What do you mean, you become something new?"`
	"CN-18835" `	"The first generation of Wanderers that passes through the wormhole [receive, undergo] the Molt," says Iktat Rek. "They are altered in their [being, essence] and become [giants, people of renown]. Those who stay behind in the safety of the old worlds remain only themselves, and slowly diminish. So all Wanderers who have [courage, ambition] yearn for the Eye to open so our species may once again [grow, evolve]."`
	"CN-18836" `	"The reason we travel through the Eye is that those who [remain behind, settle] in the easy life on the worlds that need no further [healing, repair] are diminished. But those that pass through the Eye and face the challenge of new worlds undergo the Molt. They are altered in their [being, essence] and become [giants, people of renown]. So all Wanderers who have [courage, ambition] yearn for the Eye to open so our species may once again [grow, evolve]."`
	"CN-18837" `	"What makes the wormhole open? Who or what controls it?"`
	"CN-18838" `	"Why does the Molt happen? How does it work?"`
	"CN-18839" `	"Those are questions that we do not ask," he says. "It is a [taboo? religion? mystery?] for us."`
	"CN-18840" `	You ask a few other questions, but do not gain much more information. He does mention that the other Wanderer worlds have agreed to sell you some of their technology, and that you will be allowed to "[view, admire, envy]" their ships, but not to purchase them. You thank him for his time and his willingness to trust a member of an entirely unknown species, and return to your ship.`
	"CN-18841" `You have discovered that there is a Pug outpost north of Wanderer space. Since the Pug are known to be able to control wormholes, it is likely that they are the ones that control where and when the Wanderers travel to new worlds. Do you want to tell Iktat Rek about this?`
	"CN-18842" `	You meet with Rek and explain that the Pug are a species known for interfering in the affairs of others, and that you suspect that they are the ones who open the wormhole that causes the whole Wanderer species to migrate. Rek seems unfazed by this information. "I hope you will do nothing to [anger, offend] them," he says.`
	"CN-18843" `	"Of course, but doesn't it bother you that they are controlling your species?"`
	"CN-18844" `	"They are manipulating your whole species, using you as a planetary cleanup crew. Don't you want to be free from their control?"`
	"CN-18845" `	His feathers ruffle up a bit in response to your comment, but all he says is, "It is a great [gift, blessing] to our species that the Eye leads us to new lands and new challenges whenever we become [complacent, bored]. If another species gains some [advantage, benefit] from our work as well, should that not make us more [glad, eager] to do that work, rather than less?"`
	"CN-18846" `	"But wouldn't you rather be free from their control, free to remain on these worlds you have worked so hard to restore?"`
	"CN-18847" `	"If your species is being secretly controlled by another, doesn't that bother you?"`
	"CN-18848" `	"Alright. I understand. It's just that I would be concerned if my species were being controlled in this way."`
	"CN-18849" `	"Are we being controlled," he says, "or is it a partnership? We have gifts for making [ruined, corrupted] worlds bloom with new life. They give us worlds where our gifts can be [put to use, valuable]. We need new challenges to drive our species to greater [transformation, perfection]. They open new galaxies to us."`
	"CN-18850" `	He pauses, and then says, "Of course we know that how the Eye works is too [convenient, tailor-made] to be a random phenomenon. But it is a [gift, blessing] to us, and you must do nothing to drive them away, or we will be [trapped, stranded] on these few worlds and will stagnate and decline."`
	"CN-18851" `Walking around the spaceport, you are approached by two Wanderers. One of them begins speaking in the Hai language, which your translator picks up. "Greetings, [stranger, curiosity]. We heard you are capable of [providing, gifting] help. Is this correct?"`
	"CN-18852" `	"Yes it is. What do you need?"`
	"CN-18853" `	"Depends on how much you are willing to pay."`
	"CN-18854" `	"Ambassador Sayari mentioned humans do many [jobs, hobbies] in their space. Or are we mistaken?"`
	"CN-18855" `	"Indeed we do."`
	"CN-18856" `	"We only do those jobs to get paid."`
	"CN-18857" `	"Ambassador Sayari mentioned you are great [hero, explorer] in human space, and solved many [issues, disasters]. Or are we mistaken?"`
	"CN-18858" `	"Ambassador Sayari mentioned you are great [hero, explorer], even in Hai space, and solved many [issues, disasters]. Or are we mistaken?"`
	"CN-18859" `	"I guess I could be considered a hero."`
	"CN-18860" `	"Calling me a 'great' hero would be an understatement."`
	"CN-18861" `	"That's me, but I would prefer some payment as well."`
	"CN-18862" `	The speaking Wanderer looks at you with a blank expression, and simply says, "There can be [compensation, arrangements] of <payment> for the work.`
	"CN-18863" `	"At the [body, planet] named Vara Ke'sok, there are [raids, conquests] by Unfettered that take place. During these, various structures get [damaged, hurt]. We wish you to help [fix, mend] these by carrying <tons> of [supplies, materials]."`
	"CN-18864" `	"I'd be happy to do that."`
	"CN-18865" `	"Sorry, but I have more important matters to attend to."`
	"CN-18866" `	When the Wanderer hears your translated response, they chatter in the Wanderer language to their friend, who nods and runs off towards a nearby warehouse. "We will load the cargo into the ship soon. I will [join, accompany] you to <planet> to direct the [healing, repairs]."`
	"CN-18867" `Soon after you land in the spaceport, there is a flurry of activity as many of the Wanderers fly to their ships, which begin to take off from the planet. In the sky, you see bright flashes that may be distant weapons fire or explosions.`
	"CN-18868" `	You are buffeted by wind as one of the Wanderers lands next to your ship and says, in the Hai language, "Unfettered [raider, pirate] fleet comes. We have put food on freighter, hope they take [offering, gift] and leave. If not [appeased, satisfied] you help convince them to leave. Yes?"`
	"CN-18869" `Touching down onto the planet, several Wanderers gather around your ship and prepare to carry the cargo out of your ship. Before the Wanderer you transported to <planet> can say a word, a shrill bird cry fills the air.`
	"CN-18870" `	Looking around, you suddenly see a flurry of activity as many of the Wanderers fly to their ships, which begin to take off from the planet. In the sky, you see bright flashes that may be distant weapons fire or explosions.`
	"CN-18871" `	The Wanderer that tasked you to carry the construction materials speaks up. "Unfettered [raider, pirate] fleet comes. We will put food on freighter, hope they take [offering, gift] and leave. If not [appeased, satisfied] you help convince them to leave. [Understand, empathize]?"`
	"CN-18872" `	"I will help drive the Unfettered away."`
	"CN-18873" `	"Why do I need to help? I only accepted a transport mission."`
	"CN-18874" `	The Wanderer seems slightly taken aback by your response. "Imminent [danger, aggression]. The Unfettered bring [devastation, destruction]. Many [losses, crop failures] if you do not help. Will you aid us now?"`
	"CN-18875" `	"Yes, I will help drive the Unfettered away."`
	"CN-18876" `	"No, I will not help you fight them."`
	"CN-18877" `	The Wanderer flies off to join the defense effort. A few hours later, the flashes in the sky end; the Unfettered have either been destroyed, or have gotten what they wanted and left.`
	"CN-18878" `	The Wanderer leaves to join one of the ships that is taking off, and you quickly ready your own ship to follow...`
	"CN-18879" `One of the Wanderers thanks you for your assistance. "These foes become more [dangerous, aggressive]," it says. "You will report to [leaders, elders] on <planet>. They must decide our [action, response]."`
	"CN-18880" `On <origin>, you meet up with Iktat Rek and the Hai ambassador Sayari, and tell them that you just helped to drive off an Unfettered raid on the Wanderer water world of Vara Ke'sok. "The situation is not [sustainable, livable]," says Rek. "Perhaps the Unfettered are the ones [chosen, intended] to [inherit, receive] the fruit of our labors here, but until the Eye beckons us to a new [home, place] we have nowhere else to go."`
	"CN-18881" `	"You're saying that after working so hard to restore these worlds, you would give them to someone as destructive as the Unfettered?"`
	"CN-18882" `	"That can't be right. The Unfettered wrecked their own worlds. They would wreck yours as well."`
	"CN-18883" `	"That is the [way, calling] of the Wanderers," says Rek. "We [restore, repair] worlds and leave them to others, knowing that their new [caretakers, overseers] will squander their wealth."`
	"CN-18884" `	"But why?" you ask. "Why do so much work for the sake of others who will waste what you have made?"`
	"CN-18885" `	"Because we have tended the graveyards of a hundred failed species," says Rek, "who [spent, burned] all their resources before learning [wisdom, balance]. Put any creature in too small a cage, and it will [befoul, soil, defile] its own home and die. Give it more [space, opportunity] and it may flourish." He says to Sayari, "Ambassador, are we [foolish, simple] to have this hope?"`
	"CN-18886" `	Sayari says, "The Unfettered did not make war with you or with us until recently, when their three worlds began to die. Give them a new frontier, and we may have peace again."`
	"CN-18887" `	"But what can we do about their attacks?"`
	"CN-18888" `	"Rather than helping to expand and clean up those 'cages,' why not do something about the ones who built those cages in the first place?"`
	"CN-18889" `	Sayari says, "Set every species loose to make war on each other? That would be foolishness. War favors the strong, not the wise."`
	"CN-18890" `	Iktat Rek nods in agreement. "Life is too [prolific, creative]," he says. "New species are born too often, and new planets, too seldom, if each species were to take all that it [demands, covets]. So, there must be [limits, divisions]."`
	"CN-18891" `	"Then what can we do about the Unfettered?" you ask, "Won't they eventually desire even more?"`
	"CN-18892" `	Sayari says, "To buy time, you can offer them food in exchange for peace. Call it 'tribute,' not charity, or you will offend their pride."`
	"CN-18893" `	Rek says, "This is the best [plan, option] I have heard. <last>, will you carry me to <planet> to arrange for a shipment of food?"`
	"CN-18894" `	"Sorry, I don't want to assist the Wanderers any more."`
	"CN-18895" `Once you arrive on <origin>, Iktat Rek explains, "We have [captured, salvaged] a few jump drives from the Unfettered, and installed one in a freighter. To avoid [provoking, threatening] the Unfettered, the freighter is unarmed. It would be a bad start to our [diplomacy, peacemaking] to strike the Unfettered with Wanderer weapons."`
	"CN-18896" `	"Does that mean I should not fire on them either?"`
	"CN-18897" `	"What should we do if they attack us, then?"`
	"CN-18898" `	"I would prefer that you avoid combat," he says. "The Unfettered are said to be [greedy, eager] for bribes, if you are willing to spend money to buy peace. Or simply avoid returning fire; the freighter is well shielded."`
	"CN-18899" `	It takes several hours for the massive Wanderer freighter to be loaded. Rek explains that they have kept track of which kinds of food the Unfettered prefer to steal, so they know what will be edible for them. He says, "Our destination is called <planet>. Sayari tells me that all Hai share a [custom, taboo] concerning guests, so once we land on their planet we will be able to [speak, parley] with them in safety."`
	"CN-18900" `The Unfettered make no attempt to attack you once you have landed on their planet. The Wanderer crew begins unloading the crates of food onto the landing pad, and eventually a small delegation of Unfettered leaders approaches. Iktat Rek explains that the food is a peace offering.`
	"CN-18901" `	"It is far too little," says the Unfettered leader, "too little to pay us back for the ships you have destroyed and the worlds you have stolen. Until you give us back our worlds, we cannot have peace."`
	"CN-18902" `	(Let Iktat Rek do the talking.)`
	"CN-18903" `	"You mean the ships that were destroyed while they were pillaging the Wanderers? You expect them to pay you back for those?"`
	"CN-18904" `	"Peace, human," says Iktat Rek. "We are not here to decide who is right." He gestures to you to step back and allow him to speak with the Hai alone.`
	"CN-18905" `	"This is indeed only a [token, foretaste]," says Iktat Rek. "We have plenty more to offer, and surely you see that for us to fight each other is wasteful."`
	"CN-18906" `	They talk for a while longer. Eventually the Hai leader settles on a deal: "We will send you freighters. Whenever the freighter comes, you will fill it with food. If not, it is war. If you attack the freighter, it is war. And you must let us reclaim one of our worlds."`
	"CN-18907" `	Iktat Rek says, "We will give you food, but I am not [authorized, permitted] to give you a world. I must speak to our [government, elders]." The Hai agree to that, and you get ready to return the freighter to <planet>.`
	"CN-18908" `You drop the freighter off safely on <origin>. Iktat Rek says, "Now I must return to our home, to [discuss, plan] with our elders. We cannot trust the Unfettered with a world in our space; they would build a [garrison, war fleet] there and attack us. But perhaps this [agreement, settlement] will give us peace for long enough to find a better solution."`
	"CN-18909" `When you return to <planet>, Iktat Rek meets with Ambassador Sayari and a few of the Wanderer elders. The elders thank you for the role that you played in negotiating a temporary peace, and Rek says, "We will [reward, honor] you by allowing you to purchase our current [civilian, peacekeeping] ships. And, we [request, insist] that you do not [attack, assault] the ships sent to collect [tribute], as long as they remain [peaceful, cooperative]."`
	"CN-18910" `	The elders seem to agree that this is only a temporary solution. The Unfettered cannot be granted a base in Wanderer territory: they would use their few jump drives to move a few warships at a time to that base until they had a fleet too strong for the Wanderers to defeat. Sooner or later, the Unfettered will grow tired of demanding such a base and will return to open warfare.`
	"CN-18911" `	In the meantime, the only way to defuse the situation would be to get all the jump drives out of the hands of the Unfettered - and that means discovering and stopping whoever is supplying those drives to them.`
	"CN-18912" `It has been a while since you negotiated the ceasefire between the Wanderers and the Unfettered, and so far the truce seems to be holding. Now that the immediate crisis is under control, maybe it's time to meet up with Iktat Rek to talk about finding a more permanent response to the Unfettered incursion.`
	"CN-18913" `When you arrive on <origin>, Iktat Rek greets you warmly. "Human," he says, "it is a [relief, delight] to have [peace, safety] within our territory. But the Unfettered will not be [placated, satisfied] forever. I have spoken with ambassador Sayari about this and we are agreed that we must know what [allies, accomplices] the Unfettered have, what their [strength, capability] is, and how they have acquired jump drives."`
	"CN-18914" `	"Agreed. How can I help you?"`
	"CN-18915" `	"Umm... they may actually have gotten some of those jump drives from me."`
	"CN-18916" `	Rek seems startled, but finally says, "I see. It is [understandable, forgivable] that you would want to placate them. So I will not [fault, censure] you for that. In fact it may help us that you have done so. What we [ask, desire] of you is to sell them another drive, but this time find a [pretense, excuse] to ask who else supplies them with jump drives. Since you have [helped, abetted] them, they may trust you with that information."`
	"CN-18917" `	Rek says, "What we [ask, desire] of you is to acquire a jump drive and sell it to them, to [earn, curry] more favor with them. Then find a [pretense, excuse] to ask who else supplies them with jump drives. Because you [brokered, negotiated] the ceasefire, they may trust you with that information."`
	"CN-18918" `	"But, won't it hurt you in the long run for the Unfettered to have another jump drive?"`
	"CN-18919" `	Rek says, "Over a hundred of their ships have [raided, violated] our space in the past few years. Someone is [equipping, supplying] them with many jump drives, and one more will make little difference. We must [cut off, eliminate] the source."`
	"CN-18920" `	You promise to do your best to cajole information from the Unfettered, and he wishes you luck in doing so.`
	"CN-18921" `You report to Iktat Rek. "Most [intriguing, disturbing]," he says. "If what you say of these Alpha humans is [correct, unbiased], they are a dangerous foe. And in exchange for so many jump drives, no doubt the Unfettered have [supplied, furnished] them with many weapons." He pauses to think for a minute, then says, "You must track them. There is a Wanderer [device, technology] that can help you. But I must ask our [elders, government] for permission before giving you access to it. I will meet you back in the spaceport soon."`
	"CN-18922" `Following Iktat Rek's suggestion, would you like to sell a jump drive to the Hai and see what information you can get in return?`
	"CN-18923" `	You eventually find one of the Unfettered who speaks your language. She directs you to the office of the "governor" (or perhaps warlord) in charge of the spaceport. The governor says, "I offer you same terms as to the other humans. One million credits, and we give you hyperdrive in place of jump drive. Is this acceptable?"`
	"CN-18924" `	"Sorry, let me come back when I have a jump drive to spare."`
	"CN-18925" `	Carefully, almost reverently, the Unfettered technicians remove the jump drive from your ship. The governor pays you and then stands by to watch them work. Perhaps you can get more information from him.`
	"CN-18926" `	"If I want to find more jump drives to give you, where should I look?"`
	"CN-18927" `	"You said that 'other humans' have been selling you jump drives as well?"`
	"CN-18928" `	He says, "The unfettered humans will not tell us their source, but we suspect they steal from our old foe, the Korathi invaders. The unfettered human leader told a story I did not understand, that Prometheus was punished for stealing from the gods, but no one is punished for stealing from Prometheus. Was Prometheus a human hero?"`
	"CN-18929" `	"Yes," he says, "the unfettered humans. They sell us many jump drives. They say it is their calling to help us. The unfettered human leader told a story I did not understand, that Prometheus was punished for stealing from the gods, but no one is punished for stealing from Prometheus. Was Prometheus a human hero?"`
	"CN-18930" `	You explain the myth to him as best you can, then ask, "What do you mean, 'unfettered humans'?"`
	"CN-18931" `	He seems surprised that you do not know what he is talking about. "The green ones," he says.`
	"CN-18932" `	"Alphas? You shouldn't trade with the Alphas! They're dangerous, uncontrollable criminals!"`
	"CN-18933" `	"Oh, of course. The green humans are held in as high esteem as Prometheus himself. Can you tell me where to find them, so I can give them the honor they deserve?"`
	"CN-18934" `	"That is what the altered Hai say about we the Unfettered," he says. "They say that because they are weak and afraid. Perhaps you are weak and afraid also, and I was wrong to deal with you."`
	"CN-18935" `	He is silent and looks at you with a wary, calculating expression. "They did not say where they come from," he says, "and they said others would come seeking to ensnare them. Perhaps I was wrong to trust you."`
	"CN-18936" `	You are able to get no further information from him, but what you already know is quite valuable. You should report back to Iktat Rek and see what he says.`
	"CN-18937" `When you meet Iktat Rek, he hands you a small box containing several small, charcoal black cubes, about two centimeters wide. "These are the [eyes, sensors] of our [communications? surveillance? information?] network," he says. "Until they receive the [request, query] command they generate no [signal, electromagnetic radiation] and almost no heat. But they watch, and [record, remember]. [Sow, scatter, deploy] several of these in each Unfettered system. Then you should visit the Hai [center, homeworld] and see if they know anything of the [activities, presence] of the Alphas."`
	"CN-18938" `	You bring the surveillance devices back to your ship. It looks like Rek gave you extra, presumably so that you can deploy enough in each system to have redundancy if some of them fail. It probably wouldn't make a difference to the success of the mission if you kept one for yourself, and based on what Rek said this technology might be very valuable.`
	"CN-18939" `	(Use all of them for the mission, as instructed.)`
	"CN-18940" `	(Steal one of the devices to keep for myself.)`
	"CN-18941" `	You split the devices up into three groups to launch out your airlock in each of the three Unfettered systems. Hopefully the Unfettered will not notice what you are doing.`
	"CN-18942" `	You split the devices up into three piles, one for each of the Unfettered systems, and keep one of them for yourself, well hidden in a safe place on your ship.`
	"CN-18943" `The surveillance cubes have all been deployed. While you wait for them to collect their recordings of the ship traffic in the Unfettered systems, you stop by the Hai center of government and ask for the human ambassador. When they realize that you are the one who made contact with the Wanderers, they quickly give you an appointment.`
	"CN-18944" `	The ambassador is an old, male Hai named Hiyamaharu. "Honored human," he says, "it is a pleasure to meet you. If I may assist you in any way, I shall do so."`
	"CN-18945" `	"Thank you." (Explain about the Alphas.)`
	"CN-18946" `	He says, "We know of them. Indeed, our first contact with the humans, two centuries ago, was with these green people. They sought to cheat us and dominate us. They are not merely misfits like the Unfettered; these Alpha humans are cruel and self-interested. They thought we were simple because we are peaceful, but we were too shrewd and too strong for them, and they are now banned from our territory. But then the peaceful humans came, and we learned that you are not all like the Alphas."`
	"CN-18947" `	"Is it possible that they have a hidden base on one of your worlds?"`
	"CN-18948" `	"Do you know where they went when you banned them from your space?"`
	"CN-18949" `	"No," he says, "It has been two hundred years, and our worlds are populous and overseen with great diligence. Unless they have taken refuge with the Unfettered, they are not in our space."`
	"CN-18950" `	"Then where could they have gone?" you ask.`
	"CN-18951" `	"We do not know," he says. "It is not our business to track the doings of other species, outside our territory. And during the time of the Korath raids, we would not have had the capacity to track them, anyway."`
	"CN-18952" `	You thank him for his time. Now you just have to wait long enough for the surveillance cubes to collect their data, and hope they record something useful.`
	"CN-18953" `It has been a month since you deployed the surveillance devices in the Unfettered home systems. It's time for you to go back and retrieve whatever recordings they made. You'll then be able to bring the recordings back to Iktat Rek on <planet> to decrypt and analyze them.`
	"CN-18954" `	Hopefully you will be able to collect the data without the Unfettered intercepting the transmissions and realizing they have been spied on.`
	"CN-18955" `When you arrive at the spaceport, you contact Iktat Rek and send him a copy of the encrypted recordings. You also mention to him that the Unfettered attacked you after you sent out the data retrieval signal. "That is [unfortunate, regrettable]," says Rek. "I hope they will [cool off, calm down] in time. I suspect you could buy their [friendship, favor] back with another jump drive, or just ignore their [attacks, antagonism] for now."`
	"CN-18956" `	You ask what you should do next, and Rek says, "We need some time to [analyze, inspect] the sensor logs. Meet me in the spaceport in an hour."`
	"CN-18957" `When you meet up with Iktat Rek, he shows you a picture of a Navy Carrier. "The sensors [observed, detected] this ship entering the Hi Yahr system via jump drive," he says. You tell him that it is a human military vessel. "Do you think your military could be [assisting, abetting] the Unfettered?" he asks.`
	"CN-18958" `	"It's possible, but it could also be a stolen ship. I wouldn't expect the Navy to side with the Unfettered."`
	"CN-18959" `	"I wouldn't put it past them. It could be some sort of hidden program to gain access to alien technology."`
	"CN-18960" `	Iktat Rek says, "I see. So either your [leadership, government] knows about this secret, or it is a [private, separate] military conspiracy. Either way, that worries me."`
	"CN-18961" `	"What should we do about it?" you ask.`
	"CN-18962" `	"I hope you are right," says Rek. "I do not wish our [conflict, tension] with the Unfettered to place us at war with humans. We must [investigate, explore] this matter further."`
	"CN-18963" `	"How can we do that?" you ask.`
	"CN-18964" `	"You must track this ship," says Rek. "A jump drive creates a temporary [portal? identity? oneness?] between two [locations, regions] in space. A species that [creates, manufactures] jump drives may be able to [track, detect] the residue of those links. Sayari tells me that such a species [lives in, borders on] Hai space. Perhaps they will aid you."`
	"CN-18965" `	You agree to make a visit to the Quarg ringworld in Hai space, and he wishes you luck on your journey.`
	"CN-18966" `As always, it is impossible to tell which of the Quarg is in charge here or might be able to help you. The first few you ask seem none too eager to give any technology related to the jump drive to a human, but finally one of them listens to your story and says, "I know of the Alphas. And of the Unfettered. There is one who may be willing to assist you." After a brief conversation in the Quarg language via a communication device, the Quarg says, "Return to the spaceport in an hour and one will meet you to hear your petition."`
	"CN-18967" `Iktat Rek arrives carrying a handheld device with two long antennas. "You must [pardon, forgive] me," he says. "It appears you have [dropped, misplaced] one of the tracking devices. Fortunately I have the [means, capability] to determine where on your ship it is [located, concealed]. Shall I assist you in finding it?"`
	"CN-18968" `	"No, umm... I bet it just fell out of the box in my cargo hold. I'll look around and see if I can find it."`
	"CN-18969" `	"I'm sorry, I kept one of them to try to figure out how it works. I'll go get it and give it back to you."`
	"CN-18970" `	(Get back in my ship and flee.)`
	"CN-18971" `	"I see," says Rek. You wish you were able to read Wanderer facial expressions; you are not sure if he believes you. You go into your ship, wait long enough to make it appear that you needed to search, then return and give the device back to him.`
	"CN-18972" `	"I am glad you [admitted, confessed] that," says Rek. "Please be more [honest, obedient] in the future." You retrieve the hidden surveillance device and return it to him.`
	"CN-18973" `	"Thank you," says Rek. "Now, here is what we discovered." He shows you a picture of a Navy Carrier. "The sensors [observed, detected] this ship entering the Hi Yahr system via jump drive," he says. You tell him that it is a human military vessel. "Do you think your military could be [assisting, abetting] the Unfettered?" he asks.`
	"CN-18974" `	As your ship is leaving the atmosphere, the surveillance cube suddenly glows red hot and collapses in on itself, melting down into a tiny pile of slag. Not only have you betrayed the Wanderers, but you are left with nothing to show for it.`
	"CN-18975" `As always, it is impossible to tell which of the Quarg is in charge here or might be able to help you. The first few you ask seem none too eager to give any technology related to the jump drive to a human, but finally one of them listens to your story and says, "I know of the Alphas. And of the Unfettered. There is one who may be willing to assist you." After a brief conversation in the Quarg language via a communication device, the Quarg says, "Go to the spaceport, and one will meet you to hear your petition."`
	"CN-18976" `You recall hearing hints that the Pug assisted the humans of the Deep in battle against the Alphas, so the Pug might be natural allies in your current mission. Would you like to see if any of them here will help you?`
	"CN-18977" `	You try to get several of the Pug to talk to you, but most of them pointedly ignore you. Eventually, probably because you've made it clear that you are not going away, one of them approaches you carrying a small black box. It speaks to the box in its language, and the box says, "Hello you are a human you are from planet Earth are you not." It seems that the box is a rudimentary translation device, speaking in a monotone voice and without pausing between sentences. It is somewhat jarring to listen to, but you understand what is being said.`
	"CN-18978" `	You say, "Yes, that's correct."`
	"CN-18979" `	The box appears to translate your words, and the Pug responds to it. The box says, "Humans are not our responsibility why have you come to our planet."`
	"CN-18980" `	"The Alphas are causing trouble again, and I've heard that you helped us fight them in the past."`
	"CN-18981" `	"The Alphas have sided with the ones who are invading the Wanderers. Can you help us track them down?"`
	"CN-18982" `	The Pug speaks again. "Who are the Alphas that name is not known to us."`
	"CN-18983" `	You do your best to explain. Perhaps the humans of the Deep were wrong that the Pug knew about the Alphas. The Pug responds, "We can defend the Wanderers but the Hai and humans are beyond our jurisdiction we will not enter their space."`
	"CN-18984" `	(Try to convince them to help.)`
	"CN-18985" `	You do your best, but the Pug here are clearly not interested in helping you. Eventually you give up and return to your ship.`
	"CN-18986" `You are met in the spaceport by a bearded, middle-aged human man and a Quarg with exceptionally wrinkly skin. The Quarg says, "I hear that you need help against the Alphas. My friend Elias here has lived among us for a long time, and has told me much about the Alphas, their wars and their depredations."`
	"CN-18987" `	The human shakes hands with you and introduces himself as Elias Hanover. He says, "The Quarg are very hesitant to take sides in what they view as an internal human conflict. And they are equally hesitant to entrust their technology to a stranger like you. But if the Alphas are gathering strength and amassing alien technology, they must be stopped."`
	"CN-18988" `	The Quarg says, "Elias is a trusted friend of ours. We have given him a device for tracking a ship traveling by jump drive, and programmed it with the parameters of a human Carrier. Do not try to take the device from him. He will lead you to find your quarry, and then you must return the device to us immediately."`
	"CN-18989" `	Elias asks, "If we find them, are you prepared to take on a Carrier by yourself?"`
	"CN-18990" `	"Yes, my ship is stronger than anything in human space."`
	"CN-18991" `	"I don't think so. Are you sure that will be necessary?"`
	"CN-18992" `	"You think the Alphas are likely to surrender without a fight?" he asks. "Maybe you should invest in a Hai warship before we begin chasing them down."`
	"CN-18993" `	You thank the Quarg for being willing to help you, and you and Elias return to your ship.`
	"CN-18994" `When you land back on <planet>, Elias says that he should go and immediately return the tracking device to his Quarg friend. "After that," he says, "we'll need to figure out who can help us to locate and bust open the Alpha base. Meet me in the spaceport when you're ready."`
	"CN-18995" `You park your ship high up on a mountain where you will be able to see if any of the giant reptiles approach. This is almost certainly where the Alphas have their base, but your sensors are not able to locate it, and even if you could you do not have a military ground force with you. To take care of the threat once and for all, you will need to return with an invasion force.`
	"CN-18996" `When you meet up with Elias Hanover in the spaceport, he says, "I can't think of any other way to go about it: we need to involve the Navy in this. No one else has the capability to launch a ground attack."`
	"CN-18997" `	"Are you sure we can trust them? The Alphas were in a Navy ship, after all."`
	"CN-18998" `	"We could go to Admiral Danforth. He's a Navy officer who I trust to be on the right side."`
	"CN-18999" `	"Can you think of any other option?" he says.`
	"CN-19000" `	"There's a branch of the Navy called the 'Oathkeepers,'" you tell him, "led by Admiral Danforth. If there is anyone in the Navy whom we can trust, it's them."`
	"CN-19001" `	"Danforth?" says Elias. "William Danforth? The Hero of Hope? He's still in the service?" You nod. "Well then yes, let's go to him," says Elias.`
	"CN-19002" `	He comes back aboard your ship, and you prepare to travel to Danforth's base on <destination>.`
	"CN-19003" `Admiral Danforth is very pleased to see you, but his expression turns grim when you explain why you have come. When you mention the Alphas, he hushes you. "Let's not speak of that, out here in the open," he says. "Not that I do not trust my people, but it is best to be safe. I will gather troops who I know are able to operate discreetly and have them be ready to join us on an expedition. Meet me in my private office at the spaceport when you're ready."`
	"CN-19004" `Danforth welcomes you into his private office and uses a device to sweep the room for bugs. "Please forgive my caution," he says when he is done. "Now, show me where this planet is."`
	"CN-19005" `	You show him the planet on your map. "That's a long way out from human space," says Danforth. "All the way on the other side of Hai territory. Are the Hai rebels still occupying these systems?" He points to the three systems where the Unfettered live.`
	"CN-19006" `	"Wait, you know about the Hai?"`
	"CN-19007" `	Danforth looks bemused. "Living on their doorstep? Of course I do. Why do you think the Navy maintains such a large base on Farpoint in the first place? It's not like the human anarchists up north pose that much of a threat."`
	"CN-19008" `	"It's not just the distance," says Elias. "The only way to get there is by jump drive. Fortunately Captain <last> has one."`
	"CN-19009" `	"As do I," says Danforth, a bit smugly. When he sees your surprised expressions he elaborates. "Recovered it from the Pug. Accidentally forgot to file the paperwork reporting it. You know how it is. Old men like me can be absent-minded." He smiles. "My engineers are installing it in my flagship even as we speak."`
	"CN-19010" `	"So you're willing to come with us?"`
	"CN-19011" `	"Are you sure you want to take the risk of traveling with us?"`
	"CN-19012" `	"Wouldn't miss it for the world," he says. "With a mission like this, if I want it done right, I need to be there in person. Now, let's get going before the rumors start to fly. It's hard for three squadrons to prep for a secret mission without anyone else noticing."`
	"CN-19013" `It does not take long for Danforth's team to locate the Alpha base, buried deep underground in a network of limestone caves. You and Danforth hover your ships above the site to catch anyone who tries to take off and escape. Danforth keeps you updated on the progress of the troops. "Breached the perimeter. Dealing with some booby traps. Explosives, poison gas. Nasty stuff. No sign of inhabitants, but they were here recently. Place looks cleaned out. Extensive base. Hangars, labs, supply rooms. Probably took them a century to build."`
	"CN-19014" `	His troops spend a while exploring the base and eventually conclude that the Alphas packed up and left soon after you destroyed the Carrier. Once the place has been thoroughly explored and they are sure there are no more clues to be found, Danforth tells them, "Okay, blow the place. No sense in leaving them a base to return to."`
	"CN-19015" `	"So this was all for nothing?"`
	"CN-19016" `	"I wish we had been able to catch them."`
	"CN-19017" `	"Don't feel so bad," says Danforth. "At least you took out their Carrier. If you had come for me without engaging them, chances are they would still have figured their cover was blown and fled. And now they're on the run, which is going to limit their ability to make mischief."`
	"CN-19018" `	Danforth's ship collects his troops and takes off. A few seconds later he hails you. "Captain, we have incoming ships from the far side of the planet," he says. "My ship is no match for them. Let's get out of here." It looks like this world is not completely uninhabited, after all...`
	"CN-19019" `You and Elias return to Danforth's private office to debrief, but a few minutes after you arrive there is a knock on the door. Danforth pulls up a video monitor to check who it is, swears, takes a brief glance around the room as if to check that he hasn't left anything incriminating out in plain sight, then opens the door. An officer in an unmarked uniform walks in along with several armed guards. "Admiral Danforth," says the officer, "I trust your expedition went well?"`
	"CN-19020" `	Danforth mumbles something in reply. "And you, Captain <last>," says the officer, "Always in the thick of things, eh?"`
	"CN-19021" `	"I suppose so."`
	"CN-19022" `	"Only when the galaxy needs saving."`
	"CN-19023" `	"Just trying to do what's right."`
	"CN-19024" `	The officer turns to Elias. "And Mister Hanover," he says, "I want to thank you personally for assisting us in the fight against the Alphas, once again."`
	"CN-19025" `	"You're welcome," says Hanover, warily.`
	"CN-19026" `	"You're very camera shy," says the officer. "You didn't stick around long enough to receive our thanks after helping to liberate those worlds in the Dirt Belt back in 2894 AD. Of course, you went by 'Jeremy Hanover' back then." He hands Hanover a photo of some Navy officers talking with a man who looks very much like Hanover himself.`
	"CN-19027" `	"That was my grandfather," says Hanover.`
	"CN-19028" `	"I see," says the officer. "Of course, what you deserve even more thanks for is your assistance during the Second Alpha War. Here's a photo of you from 2461 AD." He displays another photo, again apparently of Hanover himself, with some men in archaic pre-Republic uniforms. The guards standing behind you raise their weapons and point them at you and Elias.`
	"CN-19029" `	(Try to fight.)`
	"CN-19030" `	(Try to run away.)`
	"CN-19031" `	You jump up from your seat. The guards fire, and everything goes black.`
	"CN-19032" `	You raise your hands in surrender. The guards fire, and everything goes black.`
	"CN-19033" `You wake up with a pounding headache and the groggy, hung-over feeling of having been shot with a military grade stun gun. You are strapped into a metal chair with at least a dozen electrodes connected to your head and body. Elias is in a similar chair facing you. A technician stands behind a bank of computer displays in one corner, with the nameless officer looking on.`
	"CN-19034" `	"I demand that you let me go!"`
	"CN-19035" `	Seeing that you are both awake, the officer walks over and looks at you for a second with a cool, appraising expression. Then without warning, he punches you in the face.`
	"CN-19036" `	"Standard operating procedure," says the officer, walking over to you. Then, without warning, he punches you in the face.`
	"CN-19037" `	The officer walks over to you. "Sorry, I can't let you go just yet," he says. Then, without warning, he punches you in the face.`
	"CN-19038" `	While you are still reeling from the blow, the officer walks over to Elias and punches him, as well. He pauses to adjust one of the electrodes that was loosened by the blow, then walks back to you and punches you again. The technician stares down at the computer screens with an intense frown on his face as the officer hits Elias again and then walks back to you.`
	"CN-19039" `	"What the hell are you doing?"`
	"CN-19040" `	"Please just tell me what you want."`
	"CN-19041" `	(Spit in his face.)`
	"CN-19042" `	The officer glances over at the technician, who says, "<last> appears to be well within human parameters, sir."`
	"CN-19043" `	He ignores your question and glances over at the technician, who says, "<last> appears to be well within human parameters, sir."`
	"CN-19044" `	"Interesting," he says, as he wipes the spittle off his face with his sleeve. Then he glances over at the technician. "Did you get a read on that?"`
	"CN-19045" `	"<last> is well within human parameters, sir," says the technician.`
	"CN-19046" `	The officer nods in acknowledgment, then unclips your arm restraints. "It seems I owe you an apology, Captain," he says. "Would you like to hit me back?" He leans in toward you to put his face within striking range.`
	"CN-19047" `	(Punch him back.)`
	"CN-19048" `	"How kind of you," he says. Then he asks the technician, "What about Hanover?"`
	"CN-19049" `	The technician says, "Hanover isn't human. Or Alpha. I've never seen readings like this before, except maybe from an empath."`
	"CN-19050" `	You punch him. He staggers back, then looks over at the technician, who reports, "Hanover felt that, sir. Empathetic response."`
	"CN-19051" `	"What?" says the officer. He walks over and studies the monitors for a minute, then says, "Mister Hanover, you have the skin of a human. You have the physique of an Alpha. But you registered more sympathetic pain from watching someone else get struck in the face than you did when you yourself were punched, which makes your brain the complete opposite of an Alpha's. So, what the hell are you? Who made you, and why?"`
	"CN-19052" `	Elias says nothing.`
	"CN-19053" `	"Sir," says the technician, "could the stories be true?" The look in his eyes is something approaching awe.`
	"CN-19054" `	"Yes, there are the old legends," says the officer thoughtfully. "A secret weapon against the Alphas. Made in government labs with forbidden technology. Like the Alphas in some ways, but designed to serve, not to master all. Is that what you are? Are you a Beta?" Elias says nothing.`
	"CN-19055" `	"If he's not an Alpha, you have no right to imprison us."`
	"CN-19056" `	"If you're convinced that neither of us is an Alpha, will you please let us go?"`
	"CN-19057" `	"I suppose so," says the officer. As they release you from the chairs, he says to Elias, "If you are what I believe you are, we can help you to complete your work at last. Gather your siblings. Join us. Together we can put an end to the Alphas." Still, Elias says nothing.`
	"CN-19058" `	They lead you out into the hallway and you realize you are on board a Navy Cruiser. As you leave the ship, the officer tells Elias, "Think about what I said."`
	"CN-19059" `	Elias remains quiet while you are in earshot of the ship, then says, "Let's meet up with Danforth back in the spaceport and see what he thinks we should do next."`
	"CN-19060" `Danforth looks relieved to see you both alive. "Damned Republic Intelligence Agency," he says. "They think they're above the law. And after all that they decided you both are clean?" He looks intently at Elias.`
	"CN-19061" `	"Yes, in fact now they're trying to get us to work together with them against the Alphas."`
	"CN-19062" `	"Yes, and they think Elias can help them against the Alphas."`
	"CN-19063" `	"I see," says Danforth. "I wish I could tell you that they can be trusted. I wish I could tell you that there is no safer place for an enemy of the Alphas than here with me."`
	"CN-19064" `	He pauses to pull out a data pad from his desk and call up a file on it. "Recently," says Danforth, "an officer of mine assisted in taking down an Alpha enclave, like you have done." He's looking specifically at Elias as he says that. "A month later he was somehow assassinated, right here in my Naval base. Here's a photo of him." Danforth slides the data pad across the desk. It's showing a man you do not recognize, but Elias stifles a cry of dismay when he sees who it is. Danforth says, "I can't pretend you would be safe here. I think the safest thing for both of you would be to leave human space for a while."`
	"CN-19065" `	He pauses to pull out a data pad from his desk and call up a file on it. "Recently," says Danforth, "an officer of mine assisted in taking down an Alpha enclave, like you have done." He's looking specifically at Elias as he says that. "A month later he was somehow assassinated, right here in my Naval base. Here's a photo of him." Danforth slides the data pad across the desk. It's showing a photo of Commander Nguyen, and to your surprise Elias stifles a cry of dismay when he sees who it is. Danforth says, "I can't pretend you would be safe here. I think the safest thing for both of you would be to leave human space for a while."`
	"CN-19066" `	You agree that you will take Elias back to Alta Hai. Whatever Elias is, whoever might wish him harm, you can only hope that a Quarg ringworld is the safest place for him right now.`
	"CN-19067" `You drop Elias off on <origin>. "Don't worry about me," he says, "The Quarg have kept me safe here for a long time. Thanks for being willing to risk your life against the Alphas."`
	"CN-19068" `	"Wait, won't you tell me whether anything that officer said about you was true?"`
	"CN-19069" `	(Let him go without pressing him for more information.)`
	"CN-19070" `	He says, "It is true that I am six centuries old. It is true that I am not strictly human. It is true that I oppose the Alphas. More than that, I will not share, both for my own safety and for yours."`
	"CN-19071" `	You wish Elias the best of luck and tell him that you hope to meet again one day. Now you should probably return to Wanderer space and check in with Iktat Rek.`
	"CN-19072" `It's hard to be certain, but the activity around the spaceport seems more hectic than usual, and the Wanderers seem to have put some new ship models into production as well. When you ask Iktat Rek about it, he says, "When the Unfettered first [invaded, occupied] our territory, we had almost no weapons of [war, defense]. Since then we have retrieved old [designs, instructions] and begun preparing for what is to come, [unpleasant, unfortunate] though it may be."`
	"CN-19073" `	As you describe your mixed success at dealing with the Alphas, he shakes his wings and ruffles out his feathers in what seems to be a nervous, agitated gesture. "These Alpha [beings, creatures] sound more [dangerous, unreasonable, ruthless] than the Unfettered," he says. "Any [social, gregarious] species that evolves naturally develops certain [limits, checks, restraints] that an [artificial, constructed] species may not possess. How can we best [respond to, deal with] them?"`
	"CN-19074" `	"It may be wisest to leave them alone."`
	"CN-19075" `	"I think the only answer is to be strong enough that they leave you alone."`
	"CN-19076" `	"Sooner or later we will have to hunt them down and destroy them."`
	"CN-19077" `	"You are probably right," he says, uncertainly. He stares absently up into the sky and scratches at his wing with one talon. A few feathers fall out. "If only the Eye would open," he says. "I feel the air is [charged, tense] like the moment before a storm. Like we are [waiting, anticipating] something that ought to be here and is not. Though it may bring [catastrophe, upheaval, transition] I wish the wait would end."`
	"CN-19078" `	You talk for a while longer, but it seems that for now there is nothing more the Wanderers need from you. Iktat Rek mentions that you should stop by the outfitter before you leave and see "our [grim, regrettable] new devices," then thanks you once more and departs.`
	"CN-19079" `The Wanderers on <origin> are in a panic. Apparently the Unfettered have finally succeeded in capturing one of the Wanderer planets, and are now amassing a war fleet there. You should probably check with Iktat Rek and see if he needs your help to drive the Unfettered back.`
	"CN-19080" `Iktat Rek looks more harried and anxious than you have ever seen him: his feathers, normally perfectly preened, stick out at odd angles in patches on his face and shoulders, and he paces back and forth restlessly as you converse. "We have begun building warships," he says, "but do not yet have the [strength, numbers] to resist the invaders. We must retreat to a more [narrow? defensible?] position. Will you assist us in the evacuation?"`
	"CN-19081" `	"Why not strike back at the Unfettered and drive them out, before they can gain a stronger foothold?"`
	"CN-19082" `	"That is not who we are," he says. "You are not Wanderer. You cannot [understand, empathize]. Our work is not complete until the worlds we have [tended, cared for] are [gifted, bequeathed] to another. [Art, creation] is lifeless until it is [enjoyed, experienced] by others. If the Unfettered are the ones [destined, chosen] to enjoy what we have [created, accomplished], then we will gladly give our [territory, worlds] to them."`
	"CN-19083" `	"Okay, I'll help you to evacuate."`
	"CN-19084" `	"Thank you," he says. "We have assembled a fleet of freighters, refitted to carry [refugees, evacuees]. These ships are not ideal, but they will suffice for now until we can produce dedicated [transportation, evacuation] ships. Please escort the fleet to <planet>. You will receive further [orders, directions] when you land."`
	"CN-19085" `You have reached <planet>, but the Wanderer transports have not all arrived yet. You should take off and wait for them to catch up with you.`
	"CN-19086" `A female Wanderer named Emeka'a Isai meets you when you land with the freighter fleet. From the way others are obeying her orders, you would guess she is a local governor or someone of similar status. "Iktat Rek told me to expect you," she says. "We will evacuate civilians first, then the [defenders, warriors], then our [goods, possessions] if time is given. A [cohort, group] of civilians is prepared to depart already. Please escort them to <planet>." She turns away to speak to someone else. Apparently she is too busy to give you more details.`
	"CN-19087" `	(Leave her to her work, and prepare to escort the freighters.)`
	"CN-19088" `	"Could I assist you with the fighting, instead?"`
	"CN-19089" `	Surprised, she halts her other conversation and turns back to you. "It is not yet the [proper, strategic] time to fight," she says. "They come like a tide; we must fall back to higher ground where their waves will be [stretched, spent] in striving to reach us."`
	"CN-19090" `	You apologize for the interruption and agree to help escort the refugees to safety.`
	"CN-19091" `You drop off the Wanderer refugees. One of the Wanderer officials who is here to meet them tells you, "We are grateful for your [assistance, friendship]. If you are [available, willing] to help us further, go talk with Sobari Tele'ek, the military commander." The Wanderer official points toward one section of the spaceport where many Wanderers are busy loading supplies into some Wanderer ships unlike any you have seen before.`
	"CN-19092" `The ships in this corner of the spaceport are indeed a new design, stockier and less streamlined than most Wanderer ships. Sobari Tele'ek, who turns out to be a military commander, greets you and says, "For the first time in ten thousand years, we have made ships [designed, intended] for war. How do you [view, judge] them?"`
	"CN-19093" `	"That's a beautiful design."`
	"CN-19094" `	"They look like very powerful ships."`
	"CN-19095" `	His pupils dilate and contract with some inscrutable Wanderer emotion. "They are ugly ships," he says, "[ungraceful, inelegant, crude], like all things of war. An [unfortunate, regrettable] necessity."`
	"CN-19096" `	As you are talking, his communication device beeps, and an urgent voice speaks to him in the Wanderer tongue. Tele'ek turns to you and says, "<planet> is under attack. We must [drive off, push back] the Hai for long enough to prepare more of our people to evacuate. Will you help us [fight, resist] them?"`
	"CN-19097" `	"Gladly."`
	"CN-19098" `	"Sorry, I don't want to assist the Wanderers anymore."`
	"CN-19099" `	"I am glad of your [help, company]," he says, "though not of our circumstances. My ships will follow you to the <system> system. There we must fight off the Hai until the next [convoy, fleet] is ready."`
	"CN-19100" `It appears that the very last of the civilians are ready for transport to <planet>; a large crowd is gathered in the spaceport, but nearly all the buildings are vacant. Incongruously, a few Wanderers are busy sweeping the sidewalks, watering plants, and making other efforts to tidy up the port, as if to make it as presentable as possible for the Unfettered when they land.`
	"CN-19101" `	Isai greets you and asks if she can ride along with you. "These are the last of the civilians," she says. "The [warriors, defenders] will remain behind until everyone is [safe, away], then they will join us on <planet>. But most important is that the transports reach <planet> unharmed. Will you escort them?"`
	"CN-19102" `	"I will. I'm sorry you have to abandon your home."`
	"CN-19103" `	"I would be glad to stay and fight, if you want."`
	"CN-19104" `	"You are strange," she says. "You are not the one who suffers [loss, indignity] here. You have no [right, reason] to desire to strike back. Is fighting a greater [delight, enjoyment] to you than the saving of lives?"`
	"CN-19105" `	"Okay, I'll help protect the transports."`
	"CN-19106" `	"Sorry, I just thought I could be of more use to you in helping to fight than in helping to retreat."`
	"CN-19107" `	"I [predict, foresee] you will have plenty of opportunity to help with the [fighting, violence] before this situation is resolved," she says, "but for now our goal is to [avoid, minimize] conflict until we can understand the Hai better."`
	"CN-19108" `	"Okay," you say, "I'll help protect the transports."`
	"CN-19109" `	"Thank you," she says. "As before, do not [wait, tarry] or join in the fighting. Just bring our people safely to <planet>."`
	"CN-19110" `You have reached <planet>, but the Wanderer transports, or your ship carrying Isai, have not all arrived yet. You should take off and wait for them to catch up with you.`
	"CN-19111" `As the transports come in for a landing, Isai receives a message, which she passes on to you: "A council of leaders is meeting soon in our capital, and they have agreed to [permit, invite] you to join us because you are a [stakeholder, interested party] in this conflict. Can you transport me to <planet>?"`
	"CN-19112" `	"Sorry, I don't want to help the Wanderers anymore."`
	"CN-19113" `	"Thank you," she says. "We should go there quickly, so that we can decide our next [gambit, strategy] before the Hai attack us again."`
	"CN-19114" `You land on <origin>, and Emeka'a Isai leads you to the building where the council of war is taking place. Sayari, the Hai diplomat, has also been invited, along with Iktat Rek and various other leaders. Rek looks even more bedraggled than before: his wings are drooping, and more of his feathers are out of place.`
	"CN-19115" `	It is not entirely clear to you who outranks whom in the meeting, or even what roles the different participants have. To make matters worse, you are uncomfortably reminded that your translator only understands the Hai language. Rek and Isai speak mostly in Hai so that you and Sayari can be included, but when the conversation gets heated they all switch into their native tongue, a cacophony of clicks and whistles.`
	"CN-19116" `	They are looking at a map of Wanderer space, and it's clear from their gestures that the discussion is about how far they can afford to retreat in order to form a more defensive position. Rek explains to you, "When the Eye opens, we must leave this [territory, space] anyway, so a retreat now will just position us better to [embark, journey on] when the time comes."`
	"CN-19117" `	"But what if the Eye does not open and you are trapped here?"`
	"CN-19118" `	"Do you know when the Eye is going to open?"`
	"CN-19119" `	"No," says Isai, "we do not. It may not open for another hundred [years]. The Eye is a thing of [myth, mystery] and it may not answer to our need. Which is why I say that where we choose to [take a stand, draw a line], we must [hold, defend] that place firmly."`
	"CN-19120" `	"That is my concern too," says Isai. "The Eye is a thing of [myth, mystery] and it may not answer to our need. We cannot afford to make plans [assuming, expecting] that it will open this year, or even in the next hundred years. So we must choose what we can afford to [lose, cede, give up] now, and [hold, defend] the rest of our territory firmly."`
	"CN-19121" `	The Wanderer leaders decide to begin evacuating four more of their worlds closest to the Unfettered, hoping that they will not be attacked until the evacuation is complete. If necessary, they will fall back to the Ap'arak system, immediately east of this one, and take their final stand there.`
	"CN-19122" `	In the meantime, the entire Wanderer strategy depends on where and when the mythical Eye will open, the portal that will carry them to their next home. As the only Wanderer ally with access to a jump drive, perhaps you will be able to answer that question.`
	"CN-19123" `You have collected some useful information on the nature of the "Eye." You should probably head to the spaceport and meet up with Iktat Rek.`
	"CN-19124" `This world is populated by the Pug, the same enigmatic species that recently invaded human space - and left without giving you any clear answers about why they did so. You already know that the Pug have the ability to control wormholes, so it's quite likely that they have something to do with the "Eye" wormhole that the Wanderers hope will open soon.`
	"CN-19125" `You return to this Pug world hoping to get a few more answers than they offered to you last time. As before, they seem peaceful enough, but most of them are acting as if you do not exist.`
	"CN-19126" `	After you've stood around for at least 20 minutes, one of the Pug walks over to you and says, "It appears to this one that the human is not intending to just politely return to its vessel and leave. Can this one help hurry the human on its way?"`
	"CN-19127" `	"I need to know: do you control the wormhole that the Wanderers call the Eye?"`
	"CN-19128" `	"The Wanderers are being attacked. They are dying. Do you care about them?"`
	"CN-19129" `	"We do," it says.`
	"CN-19130" `	"We care deeply," it says. "They are irreplaceable, and most useful to us."`
	"CN-19131" `	"You must open the Eye so that the Wanderers can escape from the Unfettered."`
	"CN-19132" `	"Can you tell me when you plan to open the portal?"`
	"CN-19133" `	"Must we, human? Must we?"`
	"CN-19134" `	You are beginning to draw a crowd. Two more Pug walk over. One is armed with a staff. The other says to you, "Tell the world-shapers, it is not yet time for the portal to open. They must prepare to fight. Now, go."`
	"CN-19135" `	"They aren't strong enough. They will be killed."`
	"CN-19136" `	"They must become strong enough," says the Pug with the staff. "They must remember how to fight."`
	"CN-19137" `	"No. They are peaceful people. Don't force them to make war. Don't force them to kill."`
	"CN-19138" `	The Pug do not reply. Instead, they start to walk away.`
	"CN-19139" `	"I demand that you listen to me."`
	"CN-19140" `	As you try to follow the group of Pug, the first one says to the others, "The human must like getting hit with the happy stick." The one with the staff waves it menacingly in your direction.`
	"CN-19141" `	(Keep insisting that they listen.)`
	"CN-19142" `	With a somewhat contemptuous gesture, the Pug points the staff toward your face and a wave of wonderful rainbow light washes over you and bathes the whole world in iridescent sparkles that leap nimbly from the whiskers of things and nuzzle into your contented consciousness like flashing minnows of pure joy. You caper off to chase a trail of floating soapy baubles that burst with the sound of wind chimes and distant trumpets as you touch each one and the smell of ripe peaches fills the air until you stagger through your airlock and throw up in a corner.`
	"CN-19143" `	It may be time to leave this planet.`
	"CN-19144" `You meet up with Ambassador Sayari and Iktat Rek and tell them what the Pug said. "The Keepers of the Eye speak [subtly, carefully]," Rek says, "and hide truths in the [shades, distinctions] of their words. What precisely did they say?"`
	"CN-19145" `	"It is not yet time for the portal to open. You must prepare to fight."`
	"CN-19146" `	"We must [make preparations, become ready] to fight," repeats Iktat Rek, slowly. He runs a claw through the ruffled feathers of his scalp, in something akin to the human gesture of scratching your head in confusion. Quite a few feathers fall out. "I see," he says, and his wings droop even lower than before. "I will tell the [war-chiefs, strategists] to tell the [builders, designers] that we must make more and bigger warships."`
	"CN-19147" `	"How can I help in the meantime?"`
	"CN-19148" `	Sayari says, "I have offered to speak to the Hai governors, to see if they can do anything to restrain the Unfettered from making further incursions into Wanderer space. Would you be willing to transport me to <planet>?"`
	"CN-19149" `	"Of course," you say. She leaves to gather some traveling gear and to meet you at your ship.`
	"CN-19150" `The Hai are ruled by an elected "council of elders" who agree to meet with you and Sayari. After you describe the situation with the Wanderers, one of the elders says, "We had heard rumors of this. The Unfettered have recruited thousands of new warriors by telling stories of planets for us to explore and colonize, and a cowardly and foolish enemy to defeat."`
	"CN-19151" `	Sayari says, "We must not allow the Unfettered to commit genocide in the name of the Hai people."`
	"CN-19152" `	Another elder responds, "But, we promised in the Frostmark Accords that we would not interfere in Unfettered space."`
	"CN-19153" `	"They have never kept their side of the treaty," says yet another of the elders, "and surely the prevention of genocide is enough reason to break ours."`
	"CN-19154" `	"Could you threaten to cut off aid to the Unfettered if they continue their aggression?"`
	"CN-19155" `	"Could you launch an attack on the Unfettered, force them to fight a war on two fronts?"`
	"CN-19156" `	"I fear that would only drive them to further acts of desperation," says Sayari.`
	"CN-19157" `	"I will not authorize preemptive violence against our own flesh and blood," says one of the elders. "We only defend ourselves against them, never willingly initiate an attack."`
	"CN-19158" `	"Perhaps it would be enough merely to threaten them," says another of the elders. "We could gather a massive war fleet above Cloudfire. The Unfettered would need to muster a matching fleet above Darkcloak. It would draw many of their warships away from the alien territory."`
	"CN-19159" `	After well over an hour of further discussion, they reach consensus that that is their best option. As you leave the meeting, Sayari says, "And now, I would like to visit the Unfettered themselves. Perhaps we can talk sense into them."`
	"CN-19160" `The Unfettered war chiefs listen to Sayari's plea with condescending smiles on their faces. When she is done speaking, one of them says, "This is a war, not a polite dinner party. We will take what we want, when we want it. We are through with waiting on the charity of others."`
	"CN-19161" `	"But people will die, on your side as well as the Wanderers," says Sayari. "They are willing to give you these worlds if you only give them time, perhaps no more than a few months or a year. Why lose your lives to claim what will be yours soon enough?"`
	"CN-19162" `	"Better to die asserting our strength than to live with our hands outstretched to beg," says another of the chiefs.`
	"CN-19163" `	You are unable to convince them to change their plans, and as soon as the conversation ends they insist that you leave their planet. "Our warriors in orbit are eager to test this human's strength," says one of the chiefs, laughing.`
	"CN-19164" `You have been gone for several weeks, and Iktat Rek's appearance has changed drastically in that time. Nearly half his head is bald, showing scaly gray skin and scattered white under-feathers in place of his usual plumage. Patches on other parts of his body have lost their feathers as well. His appearance is shocking. In a terrestrial animal you would attribute it to a mange... or to a molt.`
	"CN-19165" `	"What is happening to you? Are you ill?"`
	"CN-19166" `	"Are you molting?"`
	"CN-19167" `	Rek says wearily, "The doctors believe it is what you would call a cancer, what my people would call a [premature, non-viable] molt. If so it will kill me. But I hope it may be the true Molt, come earlier than the [stories, myths] claim is possible - for the Eye is not yet open."`
	"CN-19168" `	"You can't tell the difference between a cancer and the Molt?"`
	"CN-19169" `	"They are the same thing," he says. "Only the [outcome, result] is different. The Molt is a cancer so [successful, virulent] that it [consumes? displaces?] every cell in one's body. But since the first Unfettered attacks a [decade] ago, hundreds of Wanderers have undergone a false Molt. All of them have died. I may be a fool to hope that I might survive."`
	"CN-19170" `	"Well, I hope that your doctors are wrong to be so pessimistic."`
	"CN-19171" `	"Isn't there anything your doctors can do?"`
	"CN-19172" `	"They could try to kill the [mutant, cancerous] cells," he says, "but if it is the true Molt, killing it would kill my future, my [true form? destiny?]. And in any case, the treatment would weaken me and leave me no [strength, attention] to help my people in this time of necessity. So for now I choose neither to hasten nor to halt the [process, progression]."`
	"CN-19173" `	"Well," you say, "I hope for your sake that it is a true Molt."`
	"CN-19174" `	"Thank you," he says. "And now, if you are willing to help my people further, they have asked for your [assistance, expertise] on <planet>. Do not worry about me; I will [face, deal with] whatever future comes, when it comes."`
	"CN-19175" `	As you return to your ship, Sayari approaches you, seemingly having listened in on your conversation with Rek. "I too have been told that my presence has been requested on <planet>." She pauses for a moment before continuing. "And while this 'Molt' is a mystery to me, I hope that it may go well for your friend." You thank Sayari for the well wishes and get ready to leave for <planet>.`
	"CN-19176" `Sobari Tele'ek, the military commander whom you met earlier, greets you and Sayari when you land. "The human who enjoys taking part in fights!" he says. "And the Hai ambassador. I am glad you have come. We have two [pieces, items] of good news for you, human. The first is that we have decided it is [permissible? prudent?] to allow you to purchase our warships. That will include the new [ugly, brutish] one, the Tempest."`
	"CN-19177" `	"Thank you," you say.`
	"CN-19178" `	"The other news is even better!" he says. "We have [saved, set aside] a fight for you. Unfettered ships of unknown design have been [spotted, discovered] in the Prakacha'a system. I ask you to destroy all these ships, then report to me what their [capabilities, strengths] are. I will discuss the [situation? troubles?] of the Unfettered with Sayari while you are gone."`
	"CN-19179" `	You tell him that you will do your best. Now that you are able to purchase Wanderer warships, you should be able to match anything the Unfettered throw at you.`
	"CN-19180" `Tele'ek and Sayari listen carefully as you outline the strengths and weaknesses of the new Unfettered carriers. "I am not greatly [concerned, frightened] by tiny fighters," Tele'ek says. "The weapon that has done us most harm is their Ion Cannons, which no ship so small can [wield, carry]. But thank you for your assistance."`
	"CN-19181" `	Sayari looks more concerned about this information. "These carriers may not be an issue for the Wanderers, but this development could cause trouble for the Hai. I have written a message describing the situation." She hands you a data chip. "Please deliver it to the council of elders on <planet>."`
	"CN-19182" `	"Please be quick if you are to deliver this message now," Tele'ek says. "We have no other [fights, brawls] for you to take part in right now, but once you return here, you will find another evacuation fleet that needs an [escort, protector]."`
	"CN-19183" `You give the message from Sayari to the spaceport authorities so that they can deliver it to the council of elders. After the message has been delivered, the council requests that you meet with them.`
	"CN-19184" `	When you arrive on <planet>, you are quickly escorted from the spaceport to the council chambers.`
	"CN-19185" `	"Greetings again, <first> <last>," one of the elders says to you. "It is our understanding that our Unfettered brothers and sisters have created a carrier ship. How difficult was it for you to combat it?"`
	"CN-19186" `	"The carrier is strong, but not strong enough, and can be easily taken down."`
	"CN-19187" `	"It was easy for me, but I can't say it will be the same for your ships to combat."`
	"CN-19188" `	"It was a difficult fight, as the carrier is very powerful."`
	"CN-19189" `	The elders mumble among themselves about this information, periodically glancing down at what must be the message from Sayari detailing the Solifuge.`
	"CN-19190" `	"We gather a large fleet above Cloudfire," one of the elders says, "and shortly afterward the Unfettered unveil this new ship. Perhaps it is only right that we respond in kind with a ship of our own."`
	"CN-19191" `	"My son is an engineer," another elder says. "He helped create our Centipede and Geocoris ships, both as a result of the humans living among us. Perhaps he would be of assistance in creating a ship to respond to the Unfettered." The elder presses a button and leans over to a microphone. "Please bring Osen into the council chamber."`
	"CN-19192" `	A short while later, the elder's son enters the chamber and introduces himself to the council. They tell him about the Unfettered having created a carrier and the need for a new ship to be created as a response, and Osen's eyes go wide.`
	"CN-19193" `	Osen begins speaking very quickly in the Hai language, so fast that your translation device seems to barely be able to keep up.`
	"CN-19194" `	"I have [exactly, precisely] the ship! My team has been [developing, producing] a ship for many [years, cycles] that carries a [fleet, squadron] of drones. We have [working, functional] [prototypes, models], but they are not yet [finished, complete]. We are still [developing, producing] technology to repair the [hull, armor] of a ship in flight, which would make this ship and its drones much more [effective, powerful]."`
	"CN-19195" `	The device continues speaking to you for nearly a minute after Osen stops talking (which is a little awkward as everyone stares at you). "Sorry, I wasn't aware that you had a translation device," Osen says, no longer speaking in Hai.`
	"CN-19196" `	"You talk really fast."`
	"CN-19197" `	Osen shrugs and smiles at you. "I speak fast when I'm excited."`
	"CN-19198" `	"When is the earliest that you could provide these ships to us?" Osen's father asks.`
	"CN-19199" `	"It would only be a few weeks for us to have a number of prototype ships ready, but I highly suggest that we wait until we have created hull repair technology. If these Unfettered Solifuges do not have such technology, then having it will give our ship an advantage by being able to redeploy damaged drones, but we believe that we are still many years away from developing technology strong enough to be of any real use."`
	"CN-19200" `	The elders once again mumble among themselves. They continue to ask Osen a number of questions about this new carrier. How difficult is one to produce? How much does it cost? What are the capabilities of the drones? How useful would it be without being able to repair the hull of its drones?`
	"CN-19201" `	After having all their questions answered, the elders seem to be interested in the idea of Osen's new ship. "This hull repair technology indeed sounds necessary," an elder says. "We will provide what funding we can to help fast track its development."`
	"CN-19202" `	Osen's father turns to you. "You have traveled many systems, <first> <last>. Perhaps you might be able to help. If you know of any peoples who have such technology from elsewhere in the galaxy, should it exist, then perhaps we could meet with them."`
	"CN-19203" `	"I'm sorry, but I can't help right now. I need to return to the Wanderers."`
	"CN-19204" `	"I'd be glad to help. I'm sure I could find someone with hull repair technology that could help."`
	"CN-19205" `	"Sayari's message mentions that you are still needed by the Wanderers," Osen's father responds. "Perhaps you should return to where you are needed the most, but when you are able to help us, we will gladly accept it." The elders all thank you for bringing Sayari's message and bid you safe travels back to <planet>.`
	"CN-19206" `	"This is understandable," Osen's father responds. "Return to where you are needed, but when you are able to help, we will gladly accept it." The elders all thank you for bringing Sayari's message and bid you safe travels back to <planet>.`
	"CN-19207" `	"This is understandable," Osen's father responds. "But we can be patient. Should you find time to help in the future, simply return to <origin> and inform the port authorities that you have what we seek, and we will meet with you again." The elders all thank you for giving them more information on the Unfettered Solifuge and bid you safe travels.`
	"CN-19208" `	"Wonderful," Osen's father responds. "Once you have finished looking, simply return to <planet> and inform the port authorities that you have what we seek, and we will meet with you again." The elders all thank you for giving them more information on the Unfettered Solifuge and bid you safe travels.`
	"CN-19209" `When you return to Wanderer space, you find four Wanderer ships that you've never seen before are parked near the spaceport. These must be the dedicated transport ships that Iktat Rek mentioned. One of the captains approaches you and says, "We are evacuating the worlds that will be [isolated, trapped] if the Unfettered gain more territory. Will you escort us to <planet>, and from there to the capital?"`
	"CN-19210" `	"Not now - I will come back when I am ready."`
	"CN-19211" `The Wanderer transports land in the spaceport and begin loading passengers. The village appears to be almost empty; all but the last few stragglers have already left. As on Varu Mer'ek before it was captured, they seem to have taken pains to leave their village as neat and tidy as possible. In similar circumstances, a human government would probably have chosen to burn everything of value to the ground rather than let it fall into enemy hands.`
	"CN-19212" `The transports offload the refugees, and one of the captains tells you that they are wanted back on <planet>. But now that you know that Iktat Rek may be dying, perhaps you should visit him while you are here.`
	"CN-19213" `	(Check in on Iktat Rek.)`
	"CN-19214" `	(No, I can always visit him next time I'm here.)`
	"CN-19215" `	You contact Rek, and he invites you to come visit him in the house where he is staying - a Wanderer tree house near the outskirts of the city. He looks even more tired than before, and the bare patches of skin are spreading. In a few places a new set of black, oily feathers seem to be growing in, but they are thin and hairlike - not enough even to cover his skin, let alone to allow him to fly.`
	"CN-19216" `	You sit and talk with him for a while. He is moving and speaking more slowly, but you are glad to see that his mind is as sharp as ever, and to pass the time he asks you all sorts of questions about human culture and history, which you answer as best you can. Eventually, you say goodbye and return to the spaceport.`
	"CN-19217" `	The transports finish unloading the last of the passengers, and get ready to follow you back to <planet>.`
	"CN-19218" `Soon after the transports land, an alarm begins to sound and you see many Wanderers, the warriors in particular, rushing to board their ships. Sobari Tele'ek swoops down and lands next to your ship, and explains quickly, "We have detected a large Unfettered fleet [incoming, approaching]. Will you join in the defense?"`
	"CN-19219" `	You agree to help them, and begin preparing your ship for takeoff...`
	"CN-19220" `The Unfettered fleet has been driven off. Tele'ek thanks you for taking part in defending this world. "Unfortunately," he says, "I just received news that this was only half of the Unfettered [assault, attack]. An equally large fleet attacked the Chirr'ay'akai system, and overwhelmed the defenses there so [quickly, unexpectedly] that some of our people did not have time to [escape, evacuate] and have been forced into hiding. If you're willing to help rescue them, please meet me in the spaceport once I am done [debriefing, informing] the warriors."`
	"CN-19221" `Sobari Tele'ek explains the situation to you. "Nearly a hundred warriors were on the ground on <planet> when it was captured," he says. "They [scattered, evaded capture] and flew away from the spaceport, then regrouped in hiding in one of the forests. I'm sending two warships to land on the planet and [retrieve, rescue] them, and I'd like you to [join, accompany] them. Any questions?"`
	"CN-19222" `	"Why do you need me to take part in this mission?"`
	"CN-19223" `	He says, "It matters deeply to some of our people to know that a member of another species is [assisting, journeying with] us in this conflict. Not merely for [morale? public relations?] but because your [support? acceptance?] gives our [self-defense, struggle] [moral weight? legitimacy?]." Your translator seems to be having trouble with the exact shades of meaning in his explanation.`
	"CN-19224" `	You agree to join the expedition, and he introduces you to the captains of the two ships that will travel with you.`
	"CN-19225" `The Wanderer warships come to a stop hovering above one of the largest forests on the planet. You see the flash of many different colors of wings as the Wanderer warriors who were hiding in the trees fly up to meet the ships, which open their airlocks to receive them. After less than five minutes, the Wanderer captains signal you that everyone is aboard, and you can return to <planet>.`
	"CN-19226" `The Wanderers on <origin> are overjoyed that the rescue succeeded, and many of them thank you personally even though you feel like your role in the mission was rather minor. As the celebration continues, Tele'ek pulls you aside and says, "We must go somewhere [quiet, private] and speak."`
	"CN-19227" `	He leads you into what looks like an officers' lounge, and you sit down at a table. "Rek who was called 'Iktat' was your [designated contact? cultural guide? species companion?], yes?" he asks. You nod, although it's clear your translator doesn't know exactly what the word means. "Rek is very sick and needs [advanced, intensive] medical care," he says. "He desires that you be the one to transport him to the [hospital, medical facility] on Tik Klai. You must return to <planet> and meet him."`
	"CN-19228" `	"Okay, I'll go there immediately."`
	"CN-19229" `	"But, it's just the Molt. He'll be fine."`
	"CN-19230" `	"It is probably [beneficial, encouraging] for Rek to maintain that hope," he says, "but our [stories, myths] say that never before has a Molt been [viable, successful] if it began when the Eye was not open."`
	"CN-19231" `	You promise that you will go visit Rek as quickly as possible, and bring him wherever he needs to go.`
	"CN-19232" `When Rek meets you in the spaceport, he is in the Wanderer equivalent of a motorized wheelchair. He has lost even more of his brown and gray plumage, and nothing but thin, withered, black feathers have grown in their place, like dark hairs growing from diseased skin. You are not sure if he has lost weight, or the loss of feathers simply makes him appear more gaunt. "I am glad you are here, <first> <last>," he says.`
	"CN-19233" `	"Don't worry, Iktat Rek. You'll make it through this."`
	"CN-19234" `	He winces when you say his name. "You must not call me that anymore," he says. "'Iktat' was my role-name, and I can serve in that role no longer. I am now known only by my core-name of Rek, or my child-name Rek d' Esta'a i' Veruk. If I survive the Molt, I will become someone new, and will receive a new role-name as well."`
	"CN-19235" `	"You're strong. I'm sure you will survive."`
	"CN-19236" `	"Do you have any idea what you will become?"`
	"CN-19237" `	"I hope so," he says, "but I cannot avoid overhearing the whispers of those around me. And the doctors say the Molt is rearranging and shutting down some of my internal organs. My primary hope now is just to live long enough to know that my people will have a future."`
	"CN-19238" `	"It is impossible to know," he says. "The Molt can make us not just a new individual, but almost a new species, with new abilities no Wanderers had before. I have some suspicions of what may be changing inside me, but I do not wish to invite ill fortune by voicing those hopes aloud."`
	"CN-19239" `	It is not until you have wheeled him halfway up the ramp into your ship that you realize something: throughout the entire conversation, Rek was speaking to you in your native language, without using the translator. You had not realized that Wanderer vocal organs could mimic human speech so perfectly.`
	"CN-19240" `	"Rek, when did you learn to speak my language?"`
	"CN-19241" `	He makes a sound halfway between a laugh and a cough, and says, "Even as my body decays, my mind has grown sharper. The more I listened to your box speaking to you, the more its words began to make sense to me."`
	"CN-19242" `	He seems too tired to answer any more questions. You make sure Rek is comfortable in one of your bunk rooms, then prepare to travel to <planet>.`
	"CN-19243" `A Wanderer hospital is not too different from a human one. You stand in a corner trying not to get in the way as they transfer Rek to a bed and connect him to various tubes and wires. Without his feathers he looks unbelievably fragile, almost skeletal, but the Wanderer nurses and doctors are handling him as gently as possible.`
	"CN-19244" `	Eventually you are left alone with him. For a while he seems to just be gazing off into the distance, his eyes unfocused. Then he seems to realize that you are here and his eyes take on a new depth and alertness as he turns to look at you. Again speaking in your own language, he says, "Go visit the Sko'karak system and tell me what you find there." Then he shuts his eyes and falls asleep.`
	"CN-19245" `You enter this system with high hopes that Rek, despite his weakened state, has sensed something significant happening here and sent you to discover it. But, your sensors pick up nothing out of the ordinary.`
	"CN-19246" `When you arrive, you can tell that the locals are agitated about something. Finally one of them switches into the Hai language and explains to you what is going on. "We have just heard that the Unfettered have [stolen, captured] three more of our worlds," he says, "but do not tell Rek the news."`
	"CN-19247" `	You visit Iktat Rek and tell him that you found nothing out of the ordinary in the Sko'karak system. He barely even opens his eyes as you speak to him. "Go back and look again," he says.`
	"CN-19248" `	"Okay, I'll go and look again."`
	"CN-19249" `	"You should know, another three systems were lost to the Unfettered."`
	"CN-19250" `	He sighs. "If the Eye would only open, it would not matter. I do not understand why the keepers of the portal will not open it and let us flee from this war into a place of safety. Go again to Sko'karak, and look."`
	"CN-19251" `You enter the system again, and do an even more detailed sensor sweep in case you missed something the first time. You find nothing.`
	"CN-19252" `When you enter the spaceport, a white-plumed Wanderer who looks eerily similar to Rek comes out of the hospital to meet you. For a brief confused moment you wonder if Rek has indeed completed the Molt and is now standing before you healed, then she introduces herself as Melaka Esta'a, Rek's mother. "Rek is asleep," she says. "Do you bring good news?"`
	"CN-19253" `	"No, I found nothing."`
	"CN-19254" `	She says, "Rek's body is destroying itself [fighting, resisting] the Molt. Soon we must give him the drugs that will [disable, eliminate] his immune system and allow the new cells to finish their [conquest, invasion] of his body. For that treatment he must enter [seclusion, isolation] to protect him from infection. But he will not go until you bring him the [word, news] he awaits."`
	"CN-19255" `	"I will go back one more time and see if anything has changed."`
	"CN-19256" `	"Should I lie to him and say the Eye is open?"`
	"CN-19257" `	"No," she says, "go back one more time and look. If there is still nothing, we will [decide, consider] what to do next."`
	"CN-19258" `This time when you enter the system, your sensors pick up some strange astronomical phenomenon out beyond the orbit of the farthest planet, a wisp of light like a gathering raincloud. It's not a wormhole, but it is a change. Perhaps it will be enough to give Rek hope.`
	"CN-19259" `You hurry into the hospital room. Rek's skin is now almost entirely bare aside from the withered, stringy black feathers that have grown in place of the once rich plumage. Rek's eyes spring open when you enter the room. "You have news," Rek says. "I can see it in your expression. What did you see?" Given how hard it is to read alien facial expressions, it would be quite remarkable if Rek could actually tell anything from looking at your face, but it would not be polite to say so.`
	"CN-19260" `	"Something has begun in the Sko'karak system, a cosmological phenomenon my ship's sensors did not recognize. It may be the Eye, beginning to open."`
	"CN-19261" `	"There is some sort of cosmological phenomenon, but it is not a wormhole. I do not want to offer you false hope."`
	"CN-19262" `	"It is the Eye," says Rek. "I am sure of it. It comes too late to save us from the great losses we have suffered, but perhaps not too late to preserve our species from destruction. So, my waiting is at an end."`
	"CN-19263" `	Rek calls to one of the nurses. The hospital bed is on wheels, and they quickly detach it from the various machines on the walls. Esta'a, Rek's mother, comes into the room and explains to you, "The room of [seclusion, isolation] is deeper underground. They will [wash, sterilize] Rek's body, then wait a week to check for any [residual, hidden] contamination, then begin to administer the drugs that will stop Rek's body from [fighting, resisting] the transformation. Even if all goes well, we will not see Rek again for a long time, and never again in this [body, form]."`
	"CN-19264" `	"Don't worry. Rek is strong enough to survive this."`
	"CN-19265" `	"Will you let me know what happens, regardless of the outcome?"`
	"CN-19266" `	"I will," she says. "Unless, of course, some great [calamity? upheaval?] befalls us and we are too caught up in other [matters, necessities]."`
	"CN-19267" `	Three Wanderer nurses come and wheel Rek's bed out the door and into an elevator. At Rek's request, you join them. The elevator opens up to a wide and vaulted hallway lined on either side by Wanderers dressed in black, come to pay their last respects to Rek. It is like something out of a dream: the subterranean passage dense with the stately forms of Wanderer officials, the black-cloaked wings and shadows contrasting with the bright linen of the hospital bed and the white plumage of Rek's mother as she follows the cart to the threshold of the isolation chamber.`
	"CN-19268" `	The door of the chamber snaps shut with a pneumatic hiss, and you make your way back up to the spaceport with the other visitors. One of the visitors is Emeka'a Isai, the former governor of Varu Mer'ek. She pulls you aside and says, "You should not [remain, dawdle] here, human. They will have need of you at the [front, battle line]. And the sight of you may be unwelcome to some of the [mourners? associates?] of Rek who are here."`
	"CN-19269" `	"Okay, I'll go to <planet> and aid in the defense."`
	"CN-19270" `	"Wait, why would people be angry at me after all I've done to help?"`
	"CN-19271" `	"Not angry at you," she says, "but some say the Molt is [triggered, provoked] by exposure to [alien, foreign] things: that your coming is what made Rek's body begin its [change, metamorphosis] too soon." She is silent for a moment, then says, "Please, do not be [concerned, grieved]. Rek may yet live, and rise to great renown as the first of a new [generation, race]. In any event, that is the past. Go, now, and help us to [secure, obtain] a future."`
	"CN-19272" `As you are coming in for a landing here you think you see a few Wanderer ships of yet another unfamiliar design, even larger than the Tempest. Their level of military technology has risen at an incredible rate since the Unfettered invasion began, even if it is true that they are just putting ancient ship and weapon designs back into production rather than inventing them anew.`
	"CN-19273" `	But the new technology cannot completely offset the fact that no living Wanderer has any real military experience. So, several of their leaders here are eager to talk with you, and you spend hours telling them stories from your recent experience in the war in human space. Sobari Tele'ek, the military commander, is among them. Your conversation is interrupted when sirens begin to sound in the spaceport. "The Hai are approaching!" says Tele'ek. "Please join us in battle, one more time."`
	"CN-19274" `You receive a message from Sobari Tele'ek: "We are [aware? incredulous?] of reports that you have [exterminated, eradicated] our Keepers in the Ap'arak system. This is unacceptable! From now on, you are no longer welcome in our [territory, space]."`
	"CN-19275" `The Wanderers here seem incredulous that they managed to drive off such a powerful Unfettered attack force. As you walk through the spaceport, many of them stop to thank you for your assistance in defending their home.`
	"CN-19276" `	Just as you reach the pavilion where the military leaders are gathering, a shadow falls over you, and you look up to see two ships approaching with the unmistakable horned silhouettes of Pug warships. Throughout the spaceport you hear Wanderer voices raised in excitement, and hundreds of them leap into the air to accompany the Pug ships to the landing pad. Sobari Tele'ek says to you, "It is a [visitation, appearance] of the Keepers! In our hour of [need, desperation] they make themselves known at last." A small delegation of Pug disembarks from the ships and approaches the pavilion on foot.`
	"CN-19277" `	"Let's hope that they offer you more help than they did last time I talked with them."`
	"CN-19278" `	"The Pug are dangerous and unpredictable. You should not trust them."`
	"CN-19279" `	"If they really cared about you, they would have intervened before so many of you died fighting the Unfettered."`
	"CN-19280" `	(Hear what the Pug have to say.)`
	"CN-19281" `	"The Keepers are [subtle, mysterious]," says Tele'ek, "but always their [intervention, action] has been for our [benefit, good]. Now be silent, and allow them to speak."`
	"CN-19282" `	The Pug delegation reaches the pavilion, and one of them begins speaking in the Wanderer language. You have no idea what they are saying, and they all seem to be ignoring your presence. A few of the Wanderer leaders respond. There's an awful lot of fanning of wings, flipping of tails, and preening of feathers going on. That might be the Wanderer way of trying to make a good impression, or else they're just feeling pleased with themselves. Or maybe they're nervous; it's hard to tell.`
	"CN-19283" `	The Pug finish their conversation with the Wanderers and return to their ships, and only then does Sobari Tele'ek turn to you and say, "Great news! They say that their two ships will [patrol, remain in] this system and [hold off, hold at bay] the Hai fleets. Also," he adds, preening himself, "they are very pleased with us for [growing, becoming] so strong. And, they say we need not [fight? worry about?] the Hai anymore."`
	"CN-19284" `	"I've fought Pug ships. There's no way two of them can stand against the entire Unfettered war fleet."`
	"CN-19285" `	"Does this mean they're finally willing to open the wormhole for you?"`
	"CN-19286" `	"Maybe they have grown stronger, too," says Tele'ek. "In any case, we are [safe, secure] here now, so we do not need your [help, protection]. Perhaps you should return to our capital and see if they need you there."`
	"CN-19287" `	Tele'ek's crest droops a little bit. "I suppose they did not make any [promises, predictions] about that," he says. "But in any case, we are [safe, secure] here now, so we do not need your [help, protection]. Perhaps you should return to our capital and see if they need you there."`
	"CN-19288" `	"Very well, I'll go check if they need me on <planet>."`
	"CN-19289" `	"You really think that nothing can go wrong here, just because the Pug have arrived?"`
	"CN-19290" `	You try to convince Tele'ek that the Pug may not be completely trustworthy, but it's clear you cannot change his mind. To the Wanderers, the Pug must have the status of gods; speaking against them is fruitless. Eventually you give up and agree to go visit <planet>.`
	"CN-19291" `A few minutes after you land on <planet>, a sudden uproar passes through the Wanderers in the spaceport. It's hard to be sure, but you think they sound excited, not frightened. Ships start taking off, more and more of them until the spaceport is almost deserted, and no one who is left seems at all interested in talking with you or explaining what is going on. You're probably going to have to return to your ship and see for yourself what all the fuss is about.`
	"CN-19292" `You've heard enough horror stories about the sort of accidents that happen when starship systems malfunction to be completely convinced of the necessity of a pre-flight safety check. As you listen to the complex symphony of hums, rattles, and clicks of the <ship> warming up, you run through a mental checklist. Computers: check. Life support: check.`
	"CN-19293" `	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up your systems for a test run... and you discover that your generator does not produce enough power to power them. You'll have to either install some batteries, or switch to a more powerful generator.`
	"CN-19294" `	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up the thrusters for a test run... and you realize, much to your embarrassment, that you do not have any thrusters installed. Time to head back to the outfitter and fix that!`
	"CN-19295" `	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up the steering engines for a test run... and you realize, much to your embarrassment, that you do not have any steering installed. Time to head back to the outfitter and fix that!`
	"CN-19296" `	By the time you reach the end of the checklist, it has grown uncomfortably warm. The air smells like ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing a plume of steam or smoke escaping from the hull near the engines. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they're likely to overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives.`
	"CN-19297" `	It is all going smoothly, but suddenly a manual confirmation prompt appears on the diagnostics screen. You hail the crew of the <ship>... and you realize, much to your embarrassment, that you do not have any bunks installed. Time to head back to the outfitter and fix that!`
	"CN-19298" `This is the bank. Here, you can apply for new mortgages, if your income and credit history allows it. The bank is also a good place to get an overview of your daily expenses: mortgage payments, crew salaries, etc.`
	"CN-19299" `Paying off a mortgage early means you pay less interest to the bank, but it is sometimes wiser to instead use your money to buy a bigger ship which can earn you more income.`
	"CN-19300" `When entering a credit value at the bank, you can put in an exact number, or use the suffixes K, M, B, and T as shorthand for thousands, millions, billions, and trillions. For example, entering a value such as "100k" would count as 100,000 credits.`
	"CN-19301" `Entering a number that is higher than what you or the bank have available will default to the maximum available value. For example, entering "1m" to pay off a 100,000 credit loan will completely pay off the loan without giving extra, should you have available credits.`
	"CN-19302" `Uh-oh! You just died. The universe can be a dangerous place for new captains!`
	"CN-19303" `Fortunately, your game is automatically saved every time you leave a planet. To load your most recent saved game, press <Show main menu> to return to the main menu, then click on "Manage Pilots" and "Enter Ship."`
	"CN-19304" `Your ship just got disabled! Before an enemy ship finishes you off, you should find someone to help you.`
	"CN-19305" `Press <Select next ship> to cycle through all the ships in this system. When you have a friendly one selected, press <Talk to selected ship> to hail it. You can then ask for help, and the ship will come over and patch you up.`
	"CN-19306" `If the ship that disabled you is still hanging around, you might need to hail them first and bribe them to leave you alone.`
	"CN-19307" `Hiring extra crew is only helpful if you plan on capturing enemy ships. Each crew member other than yourself is paid 100 credits per day. Larger ships require more than one crew member, but you will automatically hire the minimum number of crew when you buy those ships.`
	"CN-19308" `Crew members take up space that can otherwise be used for passengers.`
	"CN-19309" `Taking on jobs is a safe way to earn money. Special missions are offered in the Spaceport; more mundane jobs are posted on the Job Board. Most special missions are only offered once: if you turn one down, it will not be offered to you again.`
	"CN-19310" `The payment for a job depends on how far you must travel and how much you are carrying. Jobs that have a time limit pay extra, but you are paid nothing if you miss the deadline.`
	"CN-19311" `As you gain a reputation for skill in combat, new jobs will become available, including escorting convoys and bounty hunting.`
	"CN-19312" `There's nothing out here. The only way to get to another star system is by jumping through hyperspace. Unless you are out of fuel, you can jump by pressing <Initiate hyperspace jump>. To select which system you want to jump to, bring up the map by pressing <View star map>.`
	"CN-19313" `At any time, you can return to the main menu by pressing <Show main menu>. All the key controls can be viewed, and changed, in the Preferences.`
	"CN-19314" `You seem to be lost. The universe is a big and complicated place, and no one is going to hold your hand out here. You might want to review the key controls (press <Show main menu> to bring up the main menu, then click on "Preferences") to figure out what is going on. There is also a player's manual with much more information. To read it, go to endless-sky.github.io and click on "Manual."`
	"CN-19315" `The void between the stars is cold and empty. Your ship, a tiny oasis of warmth, drifts alone out here illuminated only by the distant light of cold, uncaring suns. The distances between the stars are vast, beyond what the human mind can grasp; you could spend your whole life drifting out here and never reach another star.`
	"CN-19316" `Or, you could press <Initiate hyperspace jump> to use your hyperdrive. It will get you there a whole lot faster.`
	"CN-19317" `Out here in the endless sky, you have the freedom to do whatever you want in your tiny new spaceship. Become the captain of a merchant fleet. Or a bounty hunter. Discover strange alien societies and powerful new technology.`
	"CN-19318" `Or if you want, you can just keep drifting here in empty space. Unless you've been ignoring all these messages, you already know that you can jump to another star system by selecting it in the map (which you bring up by pressing <View star map>), then closing the map and pressing <Initiate hyperspace jump>.`
	"CN-19319" `The hum of your ship's engine is the only sound you hear. As you have traveled farther and farther away from the center of this star system, even the occasional plink of micrometeorites against your hull has stopped. Deep space is utterly quiet and strangely beautiful. A different captain might grow bored out here, but you find yourself content and at peace.`
	"CN-19320" `Or maybe you're just really, really bad at figuring out how to play this game.`
	"CN-19321" `You slip deeper and deeper into the zen-like calm of outer space. The Tao which can be spoken is not the true Tao. The game that must be played is not the true game. You let go of all desire: your desire to press <Show main menu> and check the game's preferences to find out how to control your ship. The desire to view the other places you can travel to by pressing <View star map>. You release even the desire to press <Initiate hyperspace jump> and initiate a random hyperjump in whatever direction you are facing in. Enlightenment hovers on the edge of your consciousness, so close you can almost grasp it.`
	"CN-19322" `The void whispers its secret to your soul: outer space, it says, is not about lasers or explosions. It is not about fighting space pirates or saving the galaxy. No, the true message of the void is the utter loneliness you have found while drifting here: one tiny speck of warmth, insignificant compared to the vasty nothingness between the stars and the trillions upon trillions of souls of proud humans and inscrutable aliens whom you will never meet.`
	"CN-19323" `The inner voice urging you to do something, anything rather than just continuing to drift here, falls silent...`
	"CN-19324" `This map shows all the star systems you know about and the hyperspace links between them. You can use the map to plot a hyperspace course by clicking on the system you want to travel to. To initiate a jump to that system, close the map and press <Initiate hyperspace jump>.`
	"CN-19325" `You can also press F to search the map for a specific system or planet.`
	"CN-19326" `As you explore more of the galaxy, the star map will quickly become a very powerful tool. Clicking on a distant system will automatically plot the quickest route to it. You can Shift+click on systems to plot a route between them, or Control+click to select a system without setting a route to it.`
	"CN-19327" `There are many other useful modes the map can be set to. Click on one of the buttons in the lower right corner to learn more.`
	"CN-19328" `The ports panel shows you where systems with spaceports are, as well as a plethora of other information. Clicking on the name of the system, the government of the system, the lines under the name of each planet, or any trade commodity will color the map differently, the key to which can be seen on the right side of the screen.`
	"CN-19329" `Clicking the name of a planet, or clicking on a planet in the orbit map on the right side of the screen, will show that planet's description if you have visited it already. Clicking a planet on the orbit map will also tell your autopilot to land on that planet after you have arrived at that system at the end of your jump path.`
	"CN-19330" `The shipyard and outfitter map panels respectively display the ships and outfits sold on any planets that you have seen. Ships and outfits are displayed in categories which can be collapsed by clicking on the category name. Using Shift+click on a category name will collapse or uncollapse all the categories at once.`
	"CN-19331" `Each ship or outfit can be clicked on, displaying that item's stats while also highlighting any planets where it is sold. Using Shift+click on a ship or outfit after you already have one selected will display that item's stats side by side with the previously selected item.`
	"CN-19332" `You can also press F to search the shipyard and outfitter maps for a specific ship or outfit.`
	"CN-19333" `The starry map mode displays the stars on the system map. This can also be enabled by pressing T. The stars present in a system affect the amount of solar power and solar wind available for use by solar collectors and ramscoops respectively.`
	"CN-19334" `The galaxy can be a dangerous place! Pirates raid some systems more frequently or in greater strength than others, and a poorly defended convoy risks attracting them in many systems. To get an idea of the relative danger of different systems, click on the alert icon next to the system name.`
	"CN-19335" `Now that you have more than one ship, you can reorder the ships in your fleet by clicking and dragging them in the shipyard, outfitter, or player info panel, as long as you are landed. You will use the first ship in the list as your flagship.`
	"CN-19336" `You can also "park" escorts in the player info panel.`
	"CN-19337" `If you want to select a few similar ships from your fleet at once, double-click one of them. Other ships of the same model, with the same outfits as the one you selected will be added to your selection.`
	"CN-19338" `The player info panel contains a wide variety of information about your pilot, including their net worth, combat rating, salary, and licenses.`
	"CN-19339" `It also contains a list of all ships you currently own. Clicking on a ship and then going to the ship info tab, or double clicking on it, will bring up more information about that ship.`
	"CN-19340" `Your pilot's logbook and current missions can be accessed by clicking on the buttons below the panel.`
	"CN-19341" `The player info panel can be brought up at any time by pressing <View player info>, including mid-flight. However, some functionalities of the panel can only be accessed while landed.`
	"CN-19342" `You can click on the column headers to temporarily sort your fleet. To make this order permanent, press the "Save Order" button.`
	"CN-19343" `You can also park your ships by selecting them and pressing "Park", or by pressing "Park Local" or "Park All". Parked ships will not launch or follow you, and do not require any crew salaries. You cannot park or unpark ships mid-flight.`
	"CN-19344" `The ship info tab lets you view detailed information about ships in your fleet at any time. This includes any information you could see at a shipyard or outfitter, as well as the cargo and passengers distributed among each ship.`
	"CN-19345" `Ships can be renamed in this panel by clicking on the ship's name. While landed on a planet, you are able to change how guns and turrets are arranged by dragging the name of a weapon to another gun or turret location. While in flight, you are able to jettison individual pieces of cargo by clicking on the name of the cargo.`
	"CN-19346" `Once you're in space with multiple ships that you own, you can give orders to those escorts. Orders will be given to all selected escorts, or if no escorts are selected then all your escorts will receive the order. Escorts can be selected by either clicking on them in space, clicking the ship icon at the bottom left of the screen, or by clicking and dragging to select a group of escorts in space. The list of escort order keys can be found in the preferences panel.`
	"CN-19347" `Escorts can also be ordered with the mouse. Right-clicking on an empty point in space will order escorts to fly to and hold position at that point, while right-clicking on a hostile ship will order your escorts to focus fire on it, and right-clicking on a friendly target will cause them to follow it.`
	"CN-19348" `Escorts can be saved into control groups by pressing Control+number key. All selected escorts will then be bound to that number key, selecting the group when pressed.`
	"CN-19349" `With an asteroid scanner and a fleet, you can direct your fleet to assist with mining operations and collect mined resources.`
	"CN-19350" `If your escort or fighter has no weapons but has cargo space, then it will chase after mined resources instead of mining.`
	"CN-19351" `Shortcuts for asteroid targeting:`
	"CN-19352" `	<Select nearest asteroid> selects the nearest asteroid if you have an asteroid scanner.`
	"CN-19353" `	<Fleet: Fight my target> will focus your fleet on mining a targeted asteroid.`
	"CN-19354" `	<Fleet: Harvest flotsam> will toggle whether your fleet tries to pick up flotsam.`
	"CN-19355" `Alternate targeting:`
	"CN-19356" `	Left click - will target an asteroid without mining it.`
	"CN-19357" `	Right click - will focus your fleet to chase an asteroid and mine it.`
	"CN-19358" `You can order your escort to pick up discarded cargo or asteroid flotsam.`
	"CN-19359" `<Fleet: Harvest flotsam> will order your fleet to collect flotsam if they have free cargo.`
	"CN-19360" `Equip an asteroid scanner to learn more.`
	"CN-19361" `By enabling the "Fighters transfer cargo" preference, drones and fighters in your fleet will transfer cargo to their parent carrier if there is cargo space in the carrier. If a fighter cargo hold is full then it will return to the carrier automatically.`
	"CN-19362" `Drones and fighters will transfer cargo upon docking with their carrier for any reason.`
	"CN-19363" `You have a carrier which can use fighters to collect dropped materials if the fighter has cargo space.`
	"CN-19364" `	In Preferences and Settings under the Gameplay section, turn on "Fighters transfer cargo" to learn more.`
	"CN-19365" `Welcome to the sky! To travel to another star system, press <View star map> to view your map, and click on the system you want to travel to. Your hyperdrive can only travel along the "links" shown on your map. After selecting a destination, close your map and press <Initiate hyperspace jump> to jump to that system.`
	"CN-19366" `Your ship does not jump until you release the jump key. Once you have escorts, you can hold the key to get them ready to jump, then release it to have them all jump simultaneously.`
	"CN-19367" `When you reach a new system, you can press <Land on planet / station> to land on any inhabited planets that are there.`
	"CN-19368" `Also, don't worry about crashing into asteroids or other ships; your ship will fly safely below or above them.`
	"CN-19369" `Here, you can buy new equipment for your ship. Your ship has a limited amount of "outfit space," and most outfits use up some of that space.`
	"CN-19370" `Some types of outfits have other requirements as well. For example, only some of your outfit space can be used for engines or weapons; this is your ship's "engine capacity" and "weapon capacity." Guns and missile launchers also require a free "gun port," and turrets require a free "turret mount." Also, missiles can only be bought if you have the right launcher installed.`
	"CN-19371" `Use your scroll wheel or click and drag, to scroll the view.`
	"CN-19372" `As in the trading and shipyard panels, you can hold down Shift, Control, or Alt to buy 5, 20, or 500 of an outfit at once, or multiple keys for larger amounts.`
	"CN-19373" `You can also press F to search the outfitter for a specific item.`
	"CN-19374" `Here, you can buy new ships.`
	"CN-19375" `As in the trading and outfitter panels, you can hold down Shift, Control, or Alt to buy 5, 20, or 500 ships at once, or multiple keys for larger amounts.`
	"CN-19376" `You can also press F to search the shipyard for a specific ship.`
	"CN-19377" `Sometimes you may want to buy some outfits directly into your cargo hold instead of having them installed. Perhaps a mission has asked you to retrieve some outfits or you want to carry extra ammunition to refill your ships somewhere that does not stock those weapons. To accomplish this, you need to switch out of installation mode into 'purchase to cargo' mode. This can be achieved by Control+clicking on your selected ship to deselect it.`
	"CN-19378" `When you are in 'purchase to cargo' mode, your ship information on the right-hand side will be replaced by information on how much cargo space you currently have available.`
	"CN-19379" `Outfits that are in your cargo hold can be (re)installed at any outfitter without cost.`
	"CN-19380" `You can also uninstall outfits directly into planetary storage by selecting the outfit and pressing U. This can be useful for if you want to shuffle outfits between ships, store outfits for future use, or simply try on different outfits. Outfits in storage can also be transferred to cargo when you go to 'purchase to cargo' mode. Outfits that are in planetary storage or cargo can be (re)installed at any outfitter without cost.`
	"CN-19381" `If you sell an outfit at an outfitter, then you can immediately buy it back for the same price that you sold it, so long as you do not leave the planet. This means that you do not necessarily need to worry about uninstalling outfits into planetary storage when you are changing outfits around.`
	"CN-19382" `You can manage outfits on multiple ships at the same time. Ctrl+click a ship icon to add it to your selection. You can also use Shift+click to select a range of ships.`
	"CN-19383" `When you have more than one ship selected, you can install or remove outfits from all of those ships at once. Additionally, all selected ships with the currently selected outfit installed are marked with a pointer next to their sidebar icon.`
	"CN-19384" `Oops! You just ran out of fuel in an uninhabited star system. Fortunately, other ships are willing to help you.`
	"CN-19385" `Press <Select next ship> to cycle through all the ships in this system. When you have a friendly one selected, press <Talk to selected ship> to hail it. You can then ask for help, and if it has fuel to spare it will fly over and transfer fuel to your ship. This is easiest for the other ship to do if your ship is nearly stationary.`
	"CN-19386" `This is the trading panel. Earn money by buying commodities at a low price in one system, and selling at a higher price elsewhere. To view your map of commodity prices in other systems, press <View star map>. To buy or sell, click on [buy] or [sell], or select a line with the up and down arrows and press "+" or "-" (or Enter and Delete).`
	"CN-19387" `You can buy 5 tons at once by holding down Shift, 20 by holding down Control, 500 by holding down Alt, or larger amounts at a time by holding down two keys at once, or even all three.`
	"CN-19388" `This ship is disabled and needs your help to patch them up! Pressing <Board selected ship> will fly you to their ship and get them up and running again. Just be sure to do it when no one is trying to kill you, or they could get caught in the crossfire!`
	"CN-19389" `You've enabled controlling your ship with your mouse.`
	"CN-19390" `The nose of your ship will always turn toward your mouse pointer.`
	"CN-19391" `<Forward thrust> is used to thrust forward.`
	"CN-19392" `<Reverse> is used to thrust reverse.`
	"CN-19393" `Right mouse click will fire primary weapons.`
	"CN-19394" `<Mouse turning (hold)> will toggle mouse turning while it is held.`
	"CN-19395" `The "go to and hold" command is remapped from the right mouse button to the middle one.`
	"CN-19396" `	He spreads his arms out as if presenting a great circle. "The Assembly was an attempt at securing harmony between these polities, to prevent conflicts, and when that became impossible, to set the rules and limits of war. One representative, an Elector, per polity, with a vote weighted by the number of Avgi belonging to it, and by how those Avgi had chosen to dilute their own membership among the various polities. And from them they select three Speakers, a Triumvirate to lead the leaders."`
	"CN-19397" `While navigating the skies of this desert world, you notice subsurface readings similar to the planet where you previously encountered a member of the Gegno Vi. It's likely this world is also home to the same or a similar species of large, serpent-like creatures you confronted back then. Eventually, you come across a large Gegno Vi vessel stationed on the surface, though unlike in your prior encounter, the ship isn't sunken into the desert - it has likely landed here recently. A group of Vi warriors are marching out and nearby the vessel, and while they do, two more Gegno ships appear above you.`
	"CN-19398" `	The approaching ships descend towards the surface, paying you no attention. One of them is the same model as the one on the ground, likely some type of transport. The other, however, appears to be some sort of interceptor vessel, though it is definitely larger than something like a Sparrow from human space, maybe even the size of a Headhunter.`
	"CN-19399" `	Considering that the planet is home to more of those monsters from before, and the Vi are here in numbers, it might be best you take your leave now before the situation gets out of control again.`
	"CN-19400" `	The first time you get the device to work, you see an image of a hematite asteroid, rich in iron, with five strange-looking tally marks next to it. Mining for them may not be the best way to learn more about the Gegno, but working for them is a start.`
	"CN-19401" `	(Approach the Vi.)`
	"CN-19402" `	The Quarg here move in an unusually quiet and eerie manner. They are dismissive of the other species walking about, who are equally as dismissive of you. The strange atmosphere is eventually broken when a few Quarg start to advance towards you, moving much quicker than the rest. After some unidentifiable discussion and gestures between themselves, one of them motions you to follow them.`
	"CN-19403" `The visual of a complete Quarg Ringworld is drastically different than the alien homeworld you were on before. Such a pristine, advanced structure is quite the opposite of a disorderly industrial civilization. The population of Quarg here must be in the trillions, many times more than the population of the alien homeworld. What's even more interesting is that there are aliens of the kind you met before are here on the ring too. The Quarg must have some kind of relations with them, perhaps through trade, maintenance, or other services. Despite their presence, both they and the Quarg seem to be dismissive of one another. However, a few of the aliens occasionally glance over at you in some form of curiosity.`
	"CN-19404" `	The Quarg motions a bow to you, and the first one from earlier escorts you out of the room. It seems associating with these so-called "Gegno" would be difficult, and you will have to deal with their xenophobia for the foreseeable future.`
	"CN-19405" `	The Quarg raises from its seat, and you act in accordance. "Please do be distinctly cautious in your encounters with the Gegno. Always feel gracious to visit here once more, should you mindfully choose to do so." As you are directed out of the room, you turn back to see the Quarg bowing. You can't help but wonder what was on its mind during the conversation, but it might be for the best you are more careful from now on.`
	"CN-19406" `While you are going about your business, a faint signal starts emanating from somewhere in your ship. You aren't sure what it is, as it doesn't appear to originate from the ship itself, so you decide to take a look. After a few minutes of searching for the culprit, you come across a small device not too dissimilar from the one that was given to you by the Gegno you met on Var Oti, arbitrarily shoved into a corner of your ship's infrastructure. You don't know how or when it got there, but it doesn't appear to be dangerous.`
	"CN-19407" `	Aside from the strange signal it's emitting, all the device appears to be doing is pointing to the location of a planet within Gegno space. The only option, aside from ignoring the device, is to visit this planet and see if there are any answers to this strange situation.`
	"CN-19408" `Led here by the mysterious device on your ship, you descend to the surface of this world, going through several thick layers of clouds. Once you break though them and prepare to land, you notice what appear to be a few Gegno Scin ships grounded nearby, easily distinguished by their various green color patterns. Two of them look like military vessels you've seen in nearby systems, while a third one between them is a small shuttlecraft. The Scin must be responsible for the device, seemingly expecting you as one of their warships begins to lift off the ground and head in your direction.`
	"CN-19409" `	Wary of the Scin warship, you turn around and begin to ascend back into space. The Scin ship advances towards yours, but as it comes closer, it begins to take on an escort formation with you, following you as you leave the planet's atmosphere. You're unsure of what they're doing on the planet or why you've been led to them, but maybe it's better for you to be careful and not get involved.`
	"CN-19410" `	Once you are at your ship, they move their blade away from your neck. When you get a better look at it, you realize that the blade is shaped like a sickle as opposed to a sword, meaning there was little chance you could have avoided being decapitated if they chose to use it. Boarding your ship in a hurry, you prepare to take off, and you notice the other Scin warship also powering up. It's clear you've overstayed your welcome.`
	"CN-19411" `	They escort you back to your ship, and along the way, several more Scin stand guard in the same armor. Once you are at your ship, the blade is moved away from your neck. When you get a better look at it, you realize that the blade is shaped like a sickle as opposed to a sword, meaning there was little chance you could have escaped being decapitated if they had chosen to use it. Boarding your ship in a hurry, you prepare to take off, and you notice the other Scin warship also powering up. It's clear you've overstayed your welcome.`
	"CN-19412" `As you leave the planet's atmosphere, the Scin ship breaks formation with you and goes their separate way. While the Gegno may not be interested in associating with you overall, it seemed like the few Scin you met were interested in some capacity. There may be other opportunities to encounter the Gegno elsewhere in their space and learn more about them.`
	"CN-19413" `	Still, it might be best to listen to what the Quarg said and exercise caution going forward.`
	"CN-19414" `The Scin ships following you off the planet show little hesitation before firing their weapons at you, likely feeling provoked by your choice of actions with them during the encounter. Still, they must have some sort of interest in you if they led you to them, meaning that there could be other possibilities to get involved with the Gegno at other locations in their space.`
	"CN-19415" `	Still, the Gegno already have qualms with outsiders. It might be a good idea to listen to what the Quarg said about exercising caution, especially if it leads to hostile encounters.`
	"CN-19416" `Alfy mogą żyć wieki i jest prawdopodobne, że wiele z nich przetrwało, ukrywając się na anarchistycznych światach lub gdzieś poza ludzką przestrzenią. Na szczęście rozmnażają się znacznie wolniej niż zwykli ludzie.`
