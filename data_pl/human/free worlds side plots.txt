Instead, you could offer them some sort of pact: they stop supporting pirate fleets, and you agree to leave their planets in peace."`

			`Soon after you land, two men in militia uniforms approach your ship, and tell you they represent the "Wolf Pack." They introduce themselves as Rex and Fido; you're pretty sure those are not their real names.`
			`	Once you are in a private room inside your ship, Rex, who is the younger one, says, "With ramscoop technology, our ships will be able to venture deep into the Dirt Belt. Now, Captain, why do you think the Republic is so determined to hold on to the Dirt Belt, even if it means fighting bloody battles? It's clear that the tax revenue isn't worth it."`
			choice
				`	"Maybe it's just the principle of not ceding territory without a fight."`
				`	"Maybe they want the resources that the Dirt Belt produces?"`
					goto resources
				`	"Maybe to keep a buffer in between our territory and the worlds that really matter to them, like Earth and the Paradise Planets?"`
			`	"That might be part of it," says Rex, "but there is a larger reason."`
				goto map
			label resources
			`	"Precisely," says Rex, "and one resource in particular is more important to them than all the rest combined."`
			label map
			`	The man named Fido, who is older and has a thick beard, spreads out a map on the table. You recognize it as a chart of food prices throughout human space. "Food," says Rex. "The Dirt Belt is the breadbasket of the galaxy. And the Republic is full of teeming, overpopulated worlds that could never hope to feed themselves. If we cut off the supply of food, the Republic will be forced to make peace with us."`
			`	Fido says, "We are proposing a concentrated effort to destroy the freighter convoys that bring food to the richest, most densely populated Republic worlds. When their citizens find themselves lacking basic supplies, they will demand an end to the war."`
			choice
				`	"I'd be glad to join you. That does sound like a much quicker solution than our current policies that the Senate and the Council support."`
					goto join
				`	"You're trying to starve the Republic into submission? Won't that just add more brutality to a war that has already been far too bloody?"`
			`	"In the short run, perhaps," says Rex. "But think how many lives will be saved - how many bloody battles will be averted - by forcing them to end this war quickly rather than dragging it out across years of time."`
			choice
				`	"I don't buy your argument. If we use such reprehensible tactics to build our new society, the society we build will be as corrupt as the old one."`
				`	"Okay, you've convinced me. What do you want me to do?"`
					goto join
			`	"Very well," says Rex. "Sorry for wasting your time." They leave.`
				decline
			label join
			`	"First, you should buy a ramscoop here, if you haven't got one already," says Rex. "Then, your first target is a convoy of three freighters that will be departing from Big Sky in the Sarin system shortly. There may be escorts, but only the freighters themselves need to be destroyed."`
