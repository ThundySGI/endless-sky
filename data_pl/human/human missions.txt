			`	The inside of the racing complex is packed to capacity. Around you is a swarm of elbows and shoulders, jutting into you while you worm your way through the crowd. The sounds of rancorous conversation blend in with the pounding of rain on the roof as you glimpse a sight of the main attraction: a large, fenced-off oval. White lines inside the area form racing lanes, and arranged on the far side of the track are four cages covered with cloth.`

			`	A stagehand hops over the fence and towards the cages while the announcer continues. "Bleedbug is a veteran of the racing track. He's never taken the pole position, but perhaps this will be his lucky day!" The stagehand removes the covering of the innermost cage as a cheer rings out. The dog inside begins ferociously barking upon seeing the cacophony around him, but you can't help but notice how withered Bleedbug's body looks.`
			`	"Our second hound is one that you're all familiar with. He's an 18-time victor of the track," the voice pauses, "even if some of his wins were only by technicality." Already, a jeer is rising in the audience. The announcer says, "It's the hound that you don't want to beat: Doom." The booing reaches a peak as the stagehand takes the cover off of the largest cage of the lineup, revealing a gargantuan hound. Doom's body is finely defined, devoid of his competitor's malnutrition. As soon as he sets his eyes on Doom, Bleedbug stops yelling and retreats to the corner of his cage to whimpering. Pleased at his reputation, Doom lets out a thunderous bark.`

			`	"Now, our other two racers for the day are all-new." A murmur of anticipation sweeps through the audience. "Our first newcomer is a fine lady. Rumored to be from the wilderness of Zenith, can everyone put their hands together for Zinc!" The cover over the third cage is taken off to reveal a creature that is clearly not a dog. Her long, gray fur and piercing, golden eyes mark her as a far more graceful and feral beast, though underneath her coat, you spot atrophied muscles. Zinc initially stands unfazed by the crowd and the other dogs, calmly observing her surroundings. When Doom spots the wolf ignoring him, he begins to bark louder and louder, until she abruptly stares at him with an inscrutable expression.`
			`	"Our final contestant for the day is a most... unorthodox choice. The merchant who graciously donated her to us came with a most fascinating story. She said that the hound comes from the Paradise Worlds, and her owner wanted the pet to have a luxury flight to her holiday home. Well, let's see if she can pay her way to victory here, folks." The audience snickers. "Now, give your best welcomes to Puny!" Puny is easily the frailest of the dogs, barely more than skin and bones. White whispers of hair clump around her head, chest, and ankles, and the bottom of her cage is wet. None of the other racers acknowledge her, but the crowd is rearing to volley a variety of curses and slurs at her, as though an actual Paradise World baron was in the cage. As you look at the poodle, you can't help but feel a strange sense of familiarity.`
			`	You feel your back get nudged, and turn to see a woman dressed in rags holding four buckets filled with credits. The names of the racers are crudely written on each of them. "Betting is 3,000 credits," she says unusually sweetly.`
			choice

			`	A red light on the ceiling turns on, and the audience shouts, "Three!" A second one lights up. "Two!" A third light, this time yellow, turns on. "One!"`
			`	A green light appears, and the crowd descends into chaos as the cage doors open.`
			`	The first to move is Bleedbug, desperate to get as far away from Doom as possible. Doom himself has his eyes set on a different target. As soon as the doors open, he rushes over the lane lines towards Zinc and bares his teeth for a bite. Anticipating this, Zinc dodges beneath the attack, and lunges in with her mouth open. Doom responds to the threat by lowering his head and bashing into her, and the two animals are quickly locked into a brutal mess of teeth and blood. The crowd goes wild at the spectacle unfolding before them as the brawl approaches your section of the fence.`

Doom initially appears to have the upper hand, ramming himself into Zinc with impunity as she is sent sprawling. However, when Doom goes in for another tackle, Zinc dashes in and sinks her teeth into his neck. His roars of pain diminish into whimpers as blood spills readily on the complex's floor.`
			`	Suddenly, a gunshot rings out throughout the building. The two beasts fall over as the stagehand steps forward holding a shotgun. The crowd is left in silence for a moment, until they start to jeer and boo, angered by the unsatisfying end to the duel. The stagehand responds by pointing his gun up and firing again. "That's enough!" he yells. "If you freaks want your bloodsports, then go to the gladiator stadium, or a cockfighting ring. But this establishment will not support such degeneracy!" The crowd goes quiet, but out of the corner of your eye, you see some mean-faced figures reach into their pockets.`

Before you can react, you hear another gunshot and see a spurt of blood erupt from the man's temple. Almost instantly, the entire audience is up in arms as gunfire comes in from every direction. Acting instinctually, you duck down and crawl through the forest of legs towards the exit. Once there, you reach your hand up and push the door open before running out.`

			`	The address brings you to a stark white mansion upon a cliff overlooking the ocean. A path snakes down from the entrance of the mansion to a large, gold-plated gate. You bring Puny out from the taxi and ring the doorbell next to the gate. A minute later, a servant in a prim suit approaches. As soon as she sees him, Puny straightens up, holding her head high.`

			`	The walk to the front of the house is arduous; you pass through several different stadium-sized gardens along the way, each dedicated to a different type of biome. Looking up at the sky, you see the remnants of clouds contort unnaturally around invisible pillars. As you follow the servant, he looks back at you repeatedly, checking that you're still following. You decide to look behind yourself, and see Puny eagerly following. She has somewhat recovered from her time on Freedom, but her body is still little more than skin and bone.`
			`	By the time you reach the mansion, your skin is slightly sunburnt. The servant walks up to the oddly tall door and presses the doorbell before moving to the side, hands folded behind his back. The bell is answered by a woman with a monstrous hairdo, barely able to fit in the doorway. Puny breaks into barking as soon as she sees her, but the woman ignores the barking and says, "Walters, who is this?"`
			`	"It's the captain who put out a description of Pookie, Madam Pemefrey," the servant replies.`
			`	When she hears this, Pemefrey's expression changes from annoyance to elation. "Really? Oh, I can't thank enough for this, dearie. How was it rescuing her? Did you have to barter with smugglers to track her down? Chase down kidnappers to free her? Battle with warlords for her safety?"`

			`	Pemefrey snaps her head to look back at her servant. "Walters! I thought you were on my side!" She holds her hands on her chest. "It would be such a shame if you ruined our friendship like this. Why, I wouldn't be able to bear to keep you around if you betrayed me like that."`
			`	Walters shoots a desperate glance at you while stepping back, but otherwise says nothing.`
			`	"Now, where was I... oh, right. You. Out. Now." She claps twice, jumping Walters to attention, who beckons you and Puny back to the gate of the mansion.`
			`	You slam the door of the taxi shut as Walters locks the gate. The return journey is somewhat somber, with even Puny wearing a frown. When you look back up from Puny, you find yourself in a far more humble region of <origin>. The grandiose manors built into impossible locations are far distant, replaced with a small suburban town that would not look out of place in the Dirt Belt were it not for the picturesque mountain ranges surrounding it.`
			`	While this town is less wealthy than the neighboring estates, it is still unmistakably on a Paradise World, with the street lamps scrubbed and polished to a wasteful degree. As you pass through the commercial district, your eyes catch a sign that says "Antette and Co. Animal Adoption Agency."`

			`You wander into one of several dimly lit, smoke-filled bars near your docking bay. Soon after you sit down, a pair of hooded figures stand up and begin moving toward you. They aren't carrying any visible weapons, but on a station like this one there's a good chance that everyone you meet has a concealed gun. One of them is carrying a bundle wrapped in cloth. You can't see their faces.`

				`	(Wait and see what they want.)`
					goto meet
			
			`	You've heard too many stories of kidnappings and murders on this station to be willing to take any risks. You quickly get up and leave the bar, and walk down the passageway back toward your ship. Glancing behind you, you see that the hooded figures have decided not to follow you.`
				decline
			
			label meet
			`	The hooded figures turn out to be a boy and a girl, both perhaps thirteen or fourteen years old. The bundle in the girl's arms is a baby. "Are you a captain?" the boy asks.`
			`	"Yes," you say.`
			`	"We're looking for passage off-world," he says. "My cousin works in the refineries on Arabia, and I'm hoping he can get me a job there."`

			`	The boy grins. "No, not at all. I mean, aside from the fact that we're pirates."`
			`	Seeing the incredulous look on your face, the girl says, "Members of a pirate gang. Crew on a pirate ship. Captains are usually older, but most of the pirate ships you see out there are crewed by kids like us. It's a hard place to grow up. We want something better for our daughter."`
				goto search
			
			label payment
			`	They are silent for a long moment, looking down at the table. Finally, the boy says, "We're crew on a pirate ship, hardly better than slaves. The captain keeps our wages. We don't get paid anything unless they agree to let us go. But if you help us start a new life, we'll work hard and some day we'll pay you back."`
			`	The girl adds, "You don't know what it's like for a little girl to grow up on a pirate ship. We want something better than that for our daughter."`
			
			label search
			`	As you are conversing a bearded man and a rough-looking teenage boy enter the bar and begin looking around the room. "That's our captain," she says. "Please, you have to help us. There's a service tunnel that connects to the back entrance of the bar. We can escape through there."`
			`	You've heard of these service passageways: the most dangerous part of this lawless station, dimly lit and seldom traveled, except by drug addicts and prostitutes. This whole thing might just be a ruse to lure you into one, where they can attack you without anyone interfering. "No," says the boy, "if we head for the service tunnel, they'll be sure to notice us. Let's just stay at the table until they go away."`
			`	The baby begins to cry, softly, and she bounces it gently, trying desperately to quiet it. "Shh. Shh." For the moment, it falls silent.`

				`	(Try the service tunnel.)`
					goto tunnel
				`	(Wait.)`

				`	"I'm sorry, this isn't worth risking my life for. I'm leaving."`
	
			`	You stand up and leave. The men in the doorway make no effort to stop you.`
				decline
			
			label tunnel
			`	The boy stands up. "Wait ten seconds, then head to the tunnel," he says. He walks into the bathroom, which is right next to the back entrance that she pointed out. You wait for a few seconds, then stand up. "Don't run," says the girl. "Walk slowly. Pretend. You've had a bit too much to drink. We're headed out back to find some privacy." You don't dare look behind you to see if the men in the doorway are watching you.`
			`	Finally, you reach the back entrance, and she spins the wheel to unlock it. The hinges squeal, but it opens enough for you to squeeze through. You find yourselves in a narrow corridor lit only by flickering sodium lamps. In the yellow lamplight her face and hands look pale, jaundiced. The floor of the corridor is littered with beer bottles and discarded hypodermic needles. To one side of the door are several over-stuffed trash cans. As you step into the corridor, a rat scurries away into the darkness.`
			`	A few seconds later, watching through the open airlock, you see the boy walk out of the bathroom. He can't help stealing a quick glance towards the men in the doorway, after which he quickly ducks through the airlock and slams the door shut. "Run!" he whispers.`
			`	You begin running down the corridor, in the direction of your ship. You pass a man, slumped over in a corner; there is no time to see if he is dead, or just sleeping. In places the lights have gone out, and it is so dim that you can barely see the floor beneath you. Your footsteps pounding on the metal decking ring terribly loud up and down the empty hallway.`
			`	Eventually the passageway widens out into a maintenance room, full of humming equipment and large tanks. You duck behind one of them and listen for sounds of pursuit. "I think we're safe," says the boy. He walks over to another airlock door on the opposite wall and tugs it open. Light pours in, almost blinding at first. You are looking out into the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. Crowds of people are walking past, paying no attention to you. He glances quickly in both directions, then gestures for you to follow.`
				goto ship
			
			label outside
			`	You wait at the table, pretending that you are busy placing a drink order. The men at the door do not leave. Instead, they step into the room and begin circling around the edge of it. "What berth is your ship in?" asks the boy. You tell him. "Wait ten seconds, then follow," he says. He stands up and walks through the door. The searchers glance at him as he leaves, but they must be looking for two people together, because they ignore him.`
			`	The searchers approach the bar and begin talking to one of the bartenders. You and the girl stand up. "Walk slowly," she hisses under her breath. "Saunter. Don't run." You put an arm around her shoulders and do your best to act like an ordinary bar patron headed home with a new friend after having a bit too much to drink. You don't dare to glance at the bar to see if you are being watched.`
			`	Finally you reach the door. You are in the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. It is crowded and brightly lit. You quicken your pace slightly and begin walking toward your ship, still afraid that if you break into a run, you will attract attention. The girl keeps glancing at the shop windows that you pass by: checking the reflection to see if anyone is following you. "They're leaving the bar," she says. And then, "They're walking in the other direction. I think we're safe."`
			`	You pass a narrow doorway, probably an entrance to one of the service tunnels. The boy is standing there, holding a gun by his side. His grim expression softens somewhat when he sees you approaching.`
				goto ship
			
			label ship
			`	You quickly make your way back to your ship. As soon as the door has closed behind you, all three of you breathe a sigh of relief. A second later, the baby begins to wail, loudly. As you show them to their bunks, they introduce themselves as Joe and Maria; the baby's name is Jesse. "I don't know how to thank you," says Maria.`
			`	"Please don't take too long leaving the station," adds Joe. "But, I think we'll be safe here until you're ready to leave. There's no way they can search all the ships at the dock."`

			`	Finally the band announces that their last song will be "Sad Archie." You've never heard of it, but the fans scream in approval. It's a slow, ballad-like song about a man named Archie who lives forever and is sad because the friends he makes all grow old and die. Archie has a pet dragon, and he builds a beautiful house for the dragon, but the dragon dies young. Archie is so sad seeing the dragon's house empty and gathering dust that he rents it out to some friends, but they fight with each other and trash the place. The story makes no sense, but some of the fans are wiping away tears as the song ends.`

		conversation
			`You drop off the two managers from Rand, whose names are Eric and Alaric, at the Academy. While you wait for their meeting to end, you look around the lobby. The students have apparently just had some sort of science symposium, and poster boards are on display all along the walls. One of them catches your eye: the title is "Affordable Terraforming through Equilibrium Mapping."`
			`	The basic concept of the poster seems to be that instead of altering the climate of a planet through brute force, it ought to instead be feasible to use a properly timed nudge in the right direction to cause the climate to shift toward a new equilibrium point that supports greater biological complexity. This student seems to think that planets naturally "want" to grow more complex and support more life, but that they sometimes get "stuck" in less optimum states.`
			`	It's an intriguing idea. On the other hand, at the bottom of the paper, the professor has written, "Very poor scholarship. Do not anthropomorphize planets."`
			`	Just then, Eric and Alaric return, looking disappointed.`
			choice
				`	"No luck?"`
			`	They shake their heads. "It would cost fifteen million just to bring a specialist out for an initial consultation," says Eric, "and besides, the cost of terraforming machinery and upkeep is prohibitive. I think this whole Academy is just a money-making racket."`
			choice
				`	"Have a look at this poster. Maybe this student would help us. We could bill it as a sort of internship for her."`
				`	"Indeed. They gave this student a failing grade just for suggesting it could be done more cheaply."`
			
			`	They look at the poster. "Sounds almost too good to be true," says Alaric. "Hang on, I'll look her up in the campus directory." A few minutes later, he is on the phone with the student who made the poster. Her name is Amy. It turns out she is about to flunk out anyway, and is more than willing to travel back to Rand with you when offered a tiny fraction of what the consultant would have received.`
			`	An hour later, you meet up with Amy, and arrange for her to join you on your ship before it takes off. Eric and Alaric are very excited, but you are a bit worried about the wisdom of entrusting their planet's future to someone so young and inexperienced.`

			`Amy, Nolan, and the other two scientists tell you the known history of Tundra's climate. Millions of years ago, an asteroid impact or large volcanic eruption altered the planet's atmosphere. Now, the planet no longer retains enough heat from its host star in order to stay warm.`
			`	"Tundra's snow covered surface only exacerbates the problem, reflecting most of the star's light back into space," Nolan explains. "This means that we need to both alter the atmosphere in order for it to retain more heat and alter the surface in order for it to reflect less heat."`
			`	Amy rolls out a map of the entire planet onto the table. Different regions of the surface are color coded, and a large red spot in the planet's southern hemisphere sticks out to you.`
			`	"Tundra has very low volcanic activity, but seismic mapping has led us to this area." Amy circles the red spot with her finger. "Magma from the planet's mantle is building up under this area of the crust, which, lucky for us, is unusually thin. Still, it could be another ten thousand years before the magma builds up enough pressure under the surface to cause a supereruption, melting the snow around it and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere that over time will raise the global temperatures."`

			`	"How exactly do you plan to do that?" the Tundra representative responds. "And what will happen to the people who live near that area?"`
			`	Nolan answers, "The people who live near the volcano will need to evacuate the area with all their belongings. The Republic should provide any assistance needed for the evacuation. As for how we will cause the volcano to erupt, we need something energetic enough to crack the planet's crust in the location of the volcano, releasing the pressure that the magma is causing to spark an eruption. That's where we bring in another asteroi--"`
			`	"No, no, no!" the Republic representative exclaims, cutting Nolan off mid-sentence. "The Republic will not gain a reputation for crashing asteroids into its own planets. The consequences of such an action could be disastrous should it go wrong! And in what way will this warm the planet when the resulting volcanic winter could last decades and only result in an even colder climate? Are you not even old enough to remember how a supereruption on Hope caused the evacuation of the entire planet? If the people of Tundra are this desperate to terraform their planet then normal techniques should be employed, none of this 'equilibrium mapping' nonsense."`
			`	"Sir," Amy speaks up with a stern tone of voice, "we have already been authorized by the Republic to undergo this terraforming experiment, so unless you have half a teraton of cheap explosives, we're going to need to use an asteroid. The volcanic winter can be easily avoided by having a fleet of freighters sweep the volcanic ash out of the atmosphere, meaning we'll get the benefits of the greenhouse gases without the detriments of volcanic ash reflecting Cebalrai's heat back into space. No one knew the volcano on Hope was going to erupt, but we can prepare for this eruption and take steps to mitigate the problems." Amy looks the representative straight in the eyes and smirks. "We're scientists, we have this handled."`
			`	The representative falls silent. After a moment of thinking, he says "Captain, I need you to take me to Parliament. I may be able to authorize the use of explosives that should suffice, but it may not be as cheap as Ms. Amy is hoping. We're not about to turn asteroids into our single solution for everything."`

My father met my mother on Heartland in the Cor Caroli system while he was on a business trip, so my mother would often take me on trips to the Dirt Belt. The last time I went was before the war though; my mother didn't want me anywhere near the 'Free Loafers,' as she called them. Back then life in the Dirt Belt didn't seem anywhere near comparable to life in the Paradise Worlds, and I can only imagine how much worse it might be after being so close to a war, so I decided that I needed to do something to help.`

You would have been thrown to the floor if you hadn't been strapped in.`

For one, the creatures flying outside your window are faster than you thought possible, or perhaps the ones on the show had been drugged to make them easier to film.`
			`	A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of harmless marker gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders, Karengo included, are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has blackened scales from where it hit your ship's shields. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.`

			`	Karengo is riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon frantically tries to get him off, but deft application of his jetpack keeps him on top of the beast for now. He lets out wild screams of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole expedition. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.`

			`In the days since Riley came aboard, she has relaxed and cleaned up. She looks nearly unrecognizable from the tired, desperate woman you first saw.`
			`	On the way, she told you stories of her past, mostly of time shared with her father. As a young teen, they spent summers riding the latest horse mechs through the forest, looking for beehives to steal honey from. At age 19, she broke her ankle hoverboarding on a restricted mountain peak. Her father rescued her, avoiding the police to hike up with a medical kit. She talks about his wild birthday gifts to her each year, always a different piece of clothing with embedded AI that was just shy of what was allowed by law. As you watch, she shows how her shirt warms and constricts if it detects stress, mimicking a hug.`
			`	As you neared <system>, Riley told you about the last time she saw her father. He had become focused on his work - research into safe AI - and they hadn't seen each other for years. She had become a well-known DJ back on <origin> and had a break in her touring schedule, so she spent a good chunk of her savings meeting up with him on Memory. They spent most of a week together, reliving old times.`
			`	He'd cried when it was time to leave, and she had, too, but life went on, and it was years before she heard from him again. His message nearly broke her. "Ri, please come as soon as you can. I may not have long, and wish to hold your hand one more time. All love, Dad."`
			`	She doesn't mention it, but it's clear that she's concerned she'll arrive too late to say goodbye.`

"Do not be alarmed. I have been working on a personal project for over a decade now. My mind was uploaded to the modified Core you are looking at. I had to say goodbye in case the procedure failed - I did not know if it would work. You cannot upload a mind while it's still alive. I tried that many times."

They talk for a few tentative minutes, at first about how he's feeling, before moving onto the memories that Church retained during the transfer. You begin to relax as the two interact when you realize that Church is retelling the story of how he evaded the police to fix Riley's ankle for the third time in a row.`
			`	Finally, she turns to you. "I'll admit that he doesn't sound as lively as he used to, but... how many people get a second chance to spend time with their father before he's gone?

"... and, of course, today's top story: three-time Centurion-Division, Paradise Circuit racing champion Artemis Renard has been officially declared 'missing' after she did not return here to Sunracer after this year's Megaparsec Core Championship. The search effort has been ongoing for days now, led by Megaparsec with support from the Republic Navy and Syndicated Security. The head of the event, Quinn Emerson, put out the following statement:`
			`	"'We at Megaparsec put the greatest attention into ensuring the safety and well-being of all our event participants and guests. Over the past forty-eight hours, our search teams have fully scanned the Volax, Cardax, Moktar, Bellatrix, and Menkar systems, and we are working in conjunction with the Republic and Syndicate to fully scour their territories belonging to the circuit as well. Ms. Renard's family can rest assured that if she's out there, we'll find her.'`
			`	"'Artemis Renard, daughter of terraforming magnates August and Louisa Renard, is perhaps best known for shattering the record for the Betelgeuse Classic in last year's race, crossing the finish line nearly fifteen minutes faster than the record set by Jackson Lee over twenty years ago. She was last seen flying her ship, the Moonfox, a white and red Lionheart Flivver with race registration B-168, in the Diphda system. Anyone with information regarding her whereabouts is encouraged to contact Syndicate or Navy authorities, as well as the Megaparsec Racing Events Commission, and may be entitled to monetary reward if such information leads to the retrieval of Ms. Renard or her ship.'"`

I've spent enough time making money to know that there's no faster way to bruise a competitor than scandal.

			`Po dwoch godzinach oczekiwania w barze kosmoportu Liam i Sophie wracaja z niespodziewanie szerokimi usmiechami na twarzach. Gestem przywolujesz ich do stolika, a oni z zapalem zajmuja miejsce.`
			`	Liam odzywa sie najszybciej, jak moze. "Kapitanie <last>, okazuje sie, ze bedziemy potrzebowac czegos wiecej niz tylko podwozki do domu! Zdecydowales sie nam znowu pomoc?"`
			choice
				`	"Co mam zrobic?"`
				`	"Powiedz mi wiecej zanim podejme decyzje."`
			`	Sophie usmiecha sie do brata. "Oczywiscie, Liam nie moze sie doczekac, zeby zaczac! " Odwraca sie do ciebie. "Moze powinnam zaczac od tego, kim byl nasz ojciec. Nie poznalismy go zbyt dobrze - wracal do domu tylko od czasu do czasu. Nie zrozum mnie zle, nasi rodzice sie nie klocili, ale on mial w sobie pasje: nie potrafil dlugo usiedziec w jednym miejscu. Byl kapitanem, podobnie jak ty, i nie mogl sie doczekac, zeby eksplorowac nawet najdalsze zakatki galaktyki. Wierzymy, ze podrozowal dalej niz wiekszosc ludzkich kapitanow; czasami przywozil do domu drobiazgi, ktorych nikt nie potrafil wyjasnic. "`
			`	Zatrzymuje sie na chwile. "W kazdym razie, jego testament mowi, ze zostawil nam cos w <planet>, w <system>. Powiedzial jednak, ze nie bedzie nam tego ulatwial; uwielbial ksiazki fantasy, a w tych historiach zawsze jest nuta tajemniczosci. Powiedzial nam o kilku systemach, ktore powinnismy odwiedzic, zanim pojedziemy na Prime. To bedzie jak ostatnia opowiesc fantasy od taty!`
			`	"Oczywiscie, byloby o wiele latwiej, gdybysmy mogli przejsc bezposrednio do Prime, ale chcemy uszanowac ostatnia wole naszego ojca." Patrzy teraz prosto na ciebie. "I dlatego potrzebujemy twojej pomocy. Czy moglbys nam pomoc ponownie i przeprowadzic nas przez wszystkie te systemy?"`
			choice
				`	"Przez jakie systemy musielibysmy przelatywac?"`
				`	"Przepraszam, ale dla mnie to brzmi zbyt skomplikowanie."`
					goto "no thanks"

			`	Liam wyciaga z torby mape nieba. "To sa uklady, ktore nasz ojciec chce, zebysmy odwiedzili: <waypoints>. Te uklady sa rozsiane daleko w ludzkiej przestrzeni, ale najwyrazniej kazdy z nich ma cos wyjatkowego. Nigdy tak naprawde nie podrozowalismy poza nasza rodzinna planete, wiec to bedzie dla nas niezla przygoda! Mozemy zaoferowac 50 000 kredytow. Brzmi dobrze?"`
			choice
				`	"Brzmi dobrze!"`
				`	"Przepraszam, nie bede mogl cie zabrac. Te systemy sa zbyt daleko od siebie."`
					goto "no thanks"
			`	"Swietnie! Nie spodziewalismy sie takiej podrozy, wiec bedziemy musieli kupic troche zapasow, " mowi Sophie, "ale jak tylko bedziesz gotowy, to bedziemy na pokladzie. "`

			`	"Coz, wyglada na to, ze bedziemy musieli znalezc kogos innego, " mowi Sophie. Obie dziekuja ci za doprowadzenie ich tak daleko i odchodza.`

			`Rodzenstwo jest nietypowo ciche, byc moze w oczekiwaniu na dotarcie do celu. Dopiero gdy wszyscy wyszliscie na poklad kosmoportu Prime, Sophie mowi: "Kapitanie <last>, ogromnie nam pomogles i nie mozemy ci wystarczajaco podziekowac za to, ze zabrales nas w podroz przez cala galaktyke! Ale mamy jeszcze jedna prosbe. Oboje uwazamy, ze powinienes pojsc z nami i zobaczyc, co zostawil po sobie nasz ojciec. Chcesz to zobaczyc?"`

			`	Liam wyciaga mape - nie te, ktora mial wczesniej, ale lokalna mape Prime z oznaczeniem Nowa Tuluza. "Podobno nasz ojciec kupil cala gore na tej planecie i chce, zebysmy tam pojechali. To na zachod od nas, niedaleko Nowych Pirenejow, niedaleko kosmodromu."`

			`	"Masz racje. Nie pomyslalam o tym, na pewno byl jakis powod, dla ktorego tu trafil, " mowi Sophie.`
			`	Wszyscy troje spacerujecie przez chwile po dzielnicy kosmoportu. Wchodzac na gigantyczny plac, dostrzegacie jeden z najnowszych modeli Betelgezy, Behemota, wystawiony w centrum. Ogromny frachtowiec z licznymi stanowiskami ogniowymi goruje nawet nad placem, bedac oczywista wizytowka wiodacego przemyslu stoczniowego Prime.`
			`	Twarz Liama rozjasnia sie, jakby wlasnie cos zrozumial. "Mysle, ze nasz ojciec wybral te planete, bo zawsze byl fanem statkow Betelgezy. Zanim wyruszyl na swoje przygody, byl pilotem doswiadczalnym w stoczni."`
			`	Sophie kiwa glowa. "Right! A kiedys pozwolono mu zatrzymac jeden z ich modeli eksperymentalnych jako prezent za to, ze byl jednym z ich najbardziej produktywnych pilotow. Betelgeza prawie nie chciala go puscic, kiedy chcial wyruszyc na eksploracje galaktyki! Ale konczy nam sie czas. Moze pojdziemy teraz w gory?"`

			`	Wysiadasz z kosmodromu i wyruszasz w podroz po regionach kontynentalnej czesci Prime; po drodze mijasz pola Nowej Tuluzy, gdzie skupia sie wiekszosc lokalnego przemyslu rolnego, i wkraczasz na wzgorza Nowych Pirenejow. Po godzinie wraz z rodzenstwem wysiadasz w prowincjonalnym miasteczku. Chociaz Betelgeza zaczyna chowac sie za horyzontem, widac niewielka gore, ktora wyroznia sie na tle reszty krajobrazu.`
			label mountain
			`	Liam, z pomoca mapy, prowadzi was wszystkich do podnoza gory, gdzie natrafiacie na plaska sciane wtopiona w mala jaskinie w jej zboczu. "W instrukcji nasz ojciec zostawil fraze: Edr- i fen - wyjasnia, nieco zawstydzony, ze nie potrafi jej wymowic. "Nie wiem, co to znaczy, ale jestem pewien, ze ma to cos wspolnego z jedna z tych powiesci fantasy, ktore kiedys czytal. "`
			choice
				`	"Brzmi smiesznie, ale powiedzmy to wprost."`
				`	"Masz dziwnego ojca, ale podoba mi sie jego poczucie humoru."`
			`	Sophie liczy do trzech, a nastepnie wszyscy razem krzyczycie te fraze.`
			`	Nagle na scianie pojawia sie jasnoniebieska linia. Na sekunde oslepia cie blysk i slychac przytlumiony syczacy dzwiek, przypominajacy dzwiek ciecia skaly laserem. Gdy sie odwracasz, linia przybiera ksztalt niebieskiego prostokata, a ksztalt szybko rozszerza sie wzdluz sciany. Kiedy dociera do ziemi, staje sie na tyle duzy, ze moze objac czlowieka.`
			`	Przez chwile nic sie nie dzieje, a rodzenstwo jest zbyt oszolomione, by cokolwiek zrobic. Prostokat zaczyna migac roznymi odcieniami niebieskiego, az cala sekcja i kamien, ktory zakrywal, nagle znikaja, pozostawiajac po sobie wneke w scianie. "Moglbym przysiac, ze ten kamien byl prawdziwy, " Liam mruczy pod nosem.`

			`	"No coz, skoro juz o tym wspomniales, to niedawno kupilem malego drona z kamera, " odpowiada Liam. "Mozemy go uzyc do rozpoznania korytarza. Dziala tylko w podczerwieni, wiec nie zobaczymy zbyt wielu szczegolow, " dodaje. Liam uruchamia drona i steruje nim za pomoca malego pilota z wbudowanym wyswietlaczem. Po chwili dron odlatuje, a Liam mowi: "Mysle, ze jest bezpiecznie. Mozemy leciec. "`

			`	Gesiego, cala trojka wchodzi do korytarza za otworem. O dziwo, kamienne sciany sa idealnie gladkie, a swiatlo, ktore was prowadzi, zdaje sie pojawiac znikad. "Uzywac obcej technologii do czegos takiego, " Sophie sie smieje, "To jest calkowicie w stylu naszego taty. "`
			`	Przez dlugi czas we trojke idziecie kamiennym korytarzem, a swiatlo podaza za waszymi ruchami, az w koncu otwiera sie na kopulaste pomieszczenie, skapane w blekitnym blasku. Na scianach wisza wszelkiego rodzaju obce artefakty ustawione jeden obok drugiego, ale posrodku pomieszczenia stoi postument z wbitym w niego mieczem. W gniezdzie przed nim stoi mala tabliczka.`

			`	Idziesz na prawo od kopuly, do kolekcji obcych obiektow, wszystkie w kolorze stali i dosc kanciaste. "Wow, musial zawsze przywozic nam te drobne przedmioty ze swoich wypraw, bo te artefakty tutaj sa ogromne! " Liam wykrzykuje z innej czesci kopuly. "Jak on w ogole to wszystko tu przeniosl? "`
			`	Teraz, gdy Liam na to zwrocil uwage, wiele wiekszych artefaktow na jego drodze wyglada podobnie do technologii Sheragi, ktora studiowales z Albertem Fosterem.`

			`			"Moje drogie dzieci. Galaktyka jest ogromna, a ja podrozowalem po wielu miejscach, wiecej niz ktokolwiek w ciagu wielu zyc. Widzialem wiele swiatow, zarowno obcych, jak i ludzkich. To bylo dzielo mojego zycia.`
			`			"Ale mimo wszystko bylo wiele sciezek, ktorych nie wybralem, wiele skal, ktore pozostawilem nietkniete, i wiele swiatow, na ktorych jeszcze nie wyladowalem. I podejrzewam, ze przeczytales to, zanim te cele zostaly osiagniete. Coz, dotarlem teraz do innego celu, jedynego, ktorego nikt nie rozumie, ale do ktorego kazdy w koncu dociera. Nie boj sie o mnie.`
			`			"Ten pokoj, w ktorym teraz jestes, jest ukoronowaniem calej mojej pracy. Mam nadzieje, ze rozumiesz, ze to dla ciebie zachowalem to w tajemnicy. Moja podroz byla dluga i bezlitosna, ale to bylo moje zycie. Mam nadzieje, ze bedziesz ja kontynuowac, aby lepiej zrozumiec wszechswiat.`
			`			"Twoj ojciec."`
			`	Aby zrozumiec osobisty charakter wiadomosci, zostaw ich dwoje na chwile w spokoju, spacerujac i ogladajac artefakty po lewej stronie kopuly.`

Sophie mowi: "Kapitan <last>, Liam i ja myslelismy o tym i doszlismy do wniosku, ze nigdy nie bedziemy w stanie sprostac oczekiwaniom ojca, jesli zachowamy ten miecz. Mozemy badac wszystkie te artefakty i dzieki nim lepiej zrozumiec wszechswiat, ale nie mozemy badac tego. Aby zrozumiec jego mozliwosci, trzeba go uzywac.`
			`	"Ten miecz zawsze byl u boku naszego ojca i byl w wielu miejscach. Zabierz go do wielu innych." Zdejmuje miecz z postumentu i rzuca na niego ostatnie spojrzenie, zanim ci go wreczy. "Jest teraz twoj."`
