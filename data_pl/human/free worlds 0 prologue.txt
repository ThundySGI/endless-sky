			`You can't help noticing that the freighter parked next to the <ship> is in very bad shape, its hull pockmarked with blaster scars, as well as larger dents that may be from missiles. The crew and a number of men in militia uniforms are busy welding new hull plating onto it; the captain is having an animated conversation with a young female militia officer.`

			`	You overhear enough of the conversation to figure out that the freighter was attacked by pirates, and the militia are helping to get it in working condition again. "A little spit shine and it'll look as good as new," the officer says, but the captain of the ship doesn't look convinced and walks up to his ship to work on it alongside the crew.`
			`	The militia officer glances over her shoulder and, having spotted you listening in, waves you over. "No need to be shy," she says. "I'm guessing you're not from around here."`

			label pirates
			`	"Rougher than you're probably used to if you're from farther up north. The Navy doesn't patrol these parts, not unless there's some high profile warlord that's on their radar. Because of that, pirates have more free rein to terrorize us down here." She pauses for a moment while turning back to the freighter.

					goto eyes
			`	She says, "We're a collection of worlds that have decided that since the Navy doesn't patrol this part of the galaxy anymore, it's up to us to keep the pirates in check. The idea is that if the pirates ever try something big, like capturing an entire planet, that planet can call on the entire Pact to assist them. And, as you can see, we also do our fair share of helping out the local merchants where we can."`
			`	"Sounds like a good idea," you say.`
			label eyes
			`	"The Pact is launching a new initiative, led by myself," she says. "We're calling it the 'Thousand Eyes.' We're asking merchant ship captains to let us access their scanner logs, basically using merchants as a surveillance network. You don't have to fight the pirates, just let us know if you see them. Interested?"`

If this thing were loaded, quite a few backcountry rubes in the last few months would've had their brains blown open before I could even get around to recruiting them." She lowers the gun.`

The Act was Parliament's response, stating that taking goods from a human being is piracy, but if the owner or some living representative of theirs is not present in the system, taking those goods is a legal salvage operation. The point was to keep the Navy from being obligated to defend every equipment cache or abandoned station in the galaxy.

More than half of the Navy was mobilized to ferry our people to other planets."`

Turns out when they found out about the disaster, they mobilized without even waiting to clear it with Parliament. Which was technically within their mandate, this being a natural disaster. But the Navy is funded by taxes, and the Paradise Planets pay ten times as much in taxes as the Dirt Belt."`
			`	"The Paradise Planets viewed the Navy as their own private security force," says Katya, "so they got really mad when half the Navy suddenly vanished to assist some dirty refugees.

But they told me that we lived in one little island of safety in a dangerous galaxy, and that without the Navy protecting us the pirates or even maybe aliens would sweep in and destroy our homes and take our money. That it was us against the whole galaxy."`

From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, murder, and war; and from dying suddenly and unprepared, good Lord, deliver us..." It's very monotonous.`

(Eyes, who is sitting next to you, responds to that last petition with a fervent "Amen!") The litany is so detailed and specific that you find it both exhausting and fascinating.`

			`You land some distance from the mining settlement, and Mr. Eyes goes into the airlock in a pressure suit, cycling it to bring in some of the moon's thin atmosphere for him to test. "Firing up my instruments now," he says through the commlink. There is a long pause, and then he starts spouting a long string of creative profanity. Katya runs over to the airlock window to see what is happening.`
			`	Finally, Eyes calms down enough to say, "It's a match! Not only has there been a recent test here, but the signature matches the one we took on Geminus. This is it."`
			`	He cycles the airlock and comes back inside. "Let's fly around and see if we can find the site," he says. After a few hours of flying low over the surface and scanning for radiation signatures, you find a spot that looks like all the other meteorite craters but is full of radiation. Katya and Eyes look at the images of the surface almost in disbelief.`

I'm only detecting enough isotopes to account for one explosion, and you wouldn't just test once. If anything, this shows that the Free Worlds are being framed by someone, and they used one nuke here before bombing Geminus and Martini to make it look like it was the Free Worlds who did it."`

			`	"Katerina," says Eyes, "this is way too dangerous. As I said, if we were able to detect this then so can the Navy, and they probably already have. They could decide to occupy Clink at any moment, and you'd be trapped here with no way out."`
			`	"There's no other way," she says. "We have no time to lose. I'm willing to risk it."`

You'll see the ships around you working together to disable a single target at a time, instead of everyone trying to run their own one-on-one fights. We don't expect you to defeat every Navy ship yourself. And, try not to get too close to their ships, either; you probably don't want a group all choosing to target you." He pauses for a moment. "Though, if you're feeling brave, you could try to get a large group of ships to follow you and lead them on a wild goose chase, leaving a smaller force for everyone else to deal with before moving on to your group. It'll be a short chase, however, if you can't stay out of their weapon range and evade their missiles. If it comes to defending this system in particular, the Navy may send additional ships after the initial wave.
