And the way they're paying him is with uranium, so every nuke he gives to us means another one or two he can build for himself. Not a good situation, if you ask me, but I guess the Wolf Pack thought it was the only way to turn the tide of the war."`

			`	"Fair enough," she says, "but I hope it doesn't wreck our chances at negotiation."`
			`	Xao addresses the three of you. "We have heard your demands," he says, "and now, here is our response. Katerina Reynolds, Alondo Gruyere, and <first> <last>, you are hereby charged with treason and insurrection. Your trial will begin immediately."`
			choice
				`	"What? We were guaranteed safe passage!"`
				`	"You will regret this! If you arrest us, the Free Worlds will retaliate against you."`
			`	As you try to protest, Alondo speaks up. He is not shouting, but his voice carries over the murmur of other voices. "We have a ship in orbit. If we do not return--"`
			`	Xao cuts him off. "Your ship is no threat to us. We have already verified that it carries no nuclear weapons, and this building's shielding and anti-missile systems are quite sufficient to defend against conventional weapons. And there is nothing in its cargo hold but ordinary, non-radioactive metals."`
			`	Alondo says, "That's right. Tungsten, to be exact. Aerodynamic tungsten rods, each the size of a tree trunk, with a simple guidance system on one end. Our ship is in low earth orbit, traveling at a velocity of roughly eight kilometers per second." As he speaks, the Parliament chamber gradually grows very quiet. "So we will be returning to our ship," says Alondo, "with Miss Reynolds. If the ship in orbit does not hear from me every two minutes, it will jettison its cargo, and there will be nothing left of this building but a crater." He points to the watch he is wearing, and you realize that it must be some sort of communicator.`
			`	After a brief whispered consultation with a few of the other members of Parliament, Xao says, "You will lose this war, and you will pay dearly for it. Guards, let them return to their ship." You hurry back to your ship and take off immediately, aware that as soon as you are out of range of Earth, the Navy will probably be more than willing to attack you.`

			`The tiny spaceport on Silver is packed with people as more and more Navy ships come in for a landing. The Navy admirals have decided that there is no sense in delaying: you will be launching an attack on the Pug homeworld in the morning. Despite your success so far in battling the Pug, you know that if their entire fleet opposes you, even the Navy may not be strong enough to defeat them. This may be the last time you see many of these officers and crew members alive.`

The chapel is equally full, and the sound of whispered prayers and chanting clashes with the dance music from the pub. Through the doorway of the chapel you see some people sitting cross-legged on the floor and others kneeling on prayer rugs, as the various cultures that make up the Republic do their best to share the space.`

			`	Since Freya seems to want to be alone, you return downstairs, and discover that a sizable Oathkeeper fleet has arrived. In the main vestibule of the spaceport, an Oathkeeper officer is leading a group in qigong meditation. And surprisingly, you spot Admiral Danforth sitting with the Muslim prayer group and chanting in fluent Arabic. Meanwhile, the party outside the pub continues.`
