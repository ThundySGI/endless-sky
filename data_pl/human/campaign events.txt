Uciekly od swoich panow, zniewolily cale planety i dowodzily ogromnymi flotami statkow. Ostatecznie zostaly pokonane i albo zabite, albo ukryly sie. Mozna je rozpoznac po zielonej, fotosyntetycznej skorze.`

		conversation
			`Today, throughout human space, is Remembrance Day, the anniversary of the beginning of the Alpha Wars more than five centuries ago. The Alphas were genetically engineered soldiers, with superhuman agility and intelligence, and a complete lack of compassion or empathy. At the height of the War, dozens of planets had been enslaved by the Alphas.`
			`	Remembrance Day commemorates the beginning of the war, rather than its end, as a perpetual reminder that the war is not over: although the Alphas were defeated, some of them escaped and remained in hiding, and they and their offspring are presumed to still be present in the galaxy today.`
			`	Since the Alpha War, genetic resequencing technology has been very tightly controlled. Because the Alphas were the product of experimental genetic manipulation rather than natural evolution, it is believed that their genes are less robust than true human beings, and they are almost unable to have viable offspring without access to special technology. Therefore, most Alpha enclaves that have been discovered since the War have had very small populations, no more than a few dozen.`
			`	In these days when the Navy ensures peace throughout much of the galaxy, on many worlds the Alphas are treated as nothing more than a bogeyman story to frighten children. Because the most striking physical feature of the Alphas was their photosynthetic skin, on some worlds kids even run around wearing green face paint on Remembrance Day, trying to frighten people. But on other worlds, especially on the fringes of space where the Navy seldom patrols, the Alphas are still spoken of with fear.`

Recently, a collection of planetary governments in the southern galactic arm have sent the Republic what amounted to an ultimatum: a refusal to pay taxes until reforms are made in the election of planetary representatives. This group, calling itself the "Free Worlds," has also asked for immediate reevaluation of all existing trade tariffs and regulations concerning pilot registration. Parliament outright refused to consider any of these demands.`

			`	As you descend towards the surface of Martini, you are met by an uncharacteristic layer of thick cloud, almost smoky in appearance. The clouds completely obscure Martini's main spaceport, as well as the rest of the capital city. Perhaps because of this, the landing controller instructs you to make your way to an auxiliary spaceport about ten kilometers from the city limits.`
			`	The moment you step off your ship you realize something is very wrong. Heavily armed Navy personnel flank either side of the spaceport building's exit, and more soldiers are patrolling the port. The main road to the city echoes with sirens, and a liaison officer is herding a group of civilians toward a military transport parked precariously in a nearby field. Still more people are stretched out on cots in a makeshift field hospital in the center of the spaceport.`

Three hours ago, though, someone - quite possibly this same 'Free Worlds' group - dropped a nuclear bomb on the Galactic Stock Exchange right here on Martini. At least, we presume that the Stock Exchange was their target, since the bomb took about a quarter of the city with it, as well as the main spaceport and half of the planet's medical resources. We've got more than a million injured people here and another five million we need to evacuate. To top it off, the terrorists also bombed the Navy Yard on Geminus, which means we don't have enough personnel available to both run the evacuation and deal with other civilians."`

I'm not sure how you managed to get landing clearance, but you shouldn't be here. We've got thousands of injured people to get off-planet, even if we ignore the potential for a major follow-up attack. If you refuse to comply, I will have you arrested by the military police, and your ship will be impounded. If your crew refuses to accept the change in captainship, they will be replaced by troops from the Naval Reserve Command. Think what you will, but we've got human lives to save here and we aren't going to stop just because some hotshot captain is feeling full of themself. Is that clear?"`

As you're frogmarched toward a waiting bunker, you watch as the <ship> lifts off without you, leaving you stranded here. In the bunker, one of the soldiers who arrested you frisks you, seizing your pilot's license and handing it to a sergeant who stamps the words "Permanently Revoked" across it. With those two words, you are barred from space forever. It has been less than a year since you bought your ship, and already you have lost the right to use it as the galaxy falls apart on you.`

Only then do you see that you've left the video screen in your ship on, playing footage almost identical to what you saw on the ground not long ago. According to the newscaster, this debacle was all started yesterday, when a group of planets in the south of the galaxy sent the Republic Parliament an ultimatum: a refusal to pay taxes until reforms are made in the election of planetary representatives.

			`When you walk into <origin>'s outfitter, you notice it has a raft of new outfits for sale; cooling equipment, afterburners, even new generators. Strangely, almost all the new stock appears to be from Kraz Cybernetics and Delta V - companies you'd usually see selling along the Southern Rim, not far up here so close to the center of the Republic. It is especially strange as those companies have been vocal supporters of the Free Worlds secessionists.`
			choice
				`	(Ask the proprietor about the new outfits.)`
				`	(Move on.)`
					decline

			`	The proprietor's busy at his desk inside the outfitter's small office, but as you approach he gets up and acknowledges you. "Hi, how can I help you today?"`
			choice
				`	"How come you're selling Kraz and Delta V outfits up here?"`
				`	"It looks like you've got new stock."`
					goto "new stock"
				`	(Move on.)`
					decline

			`	"You're not the first to ask!" the proprietor responds overly brightly. "With piracy on the rise, the increased tensions, and - what everybody's assuming but not saying - impending conflict with the nuke-happy secessionists down in the Southern Rim, we've had a lot of requests to stock some more... specialized equipment."`
			`	He walks you over to a crate of Javelins. "A load of this stuff comes from the Syndicate, you know. Apparently they already had a load of these missiles in production, but now that Kraz and Delta V are no longer companies operating in the Republic, they've snapped up all the rights to manufacture their products!" He chuckles. "It's great for captains who rely on Delta V equipment but can't go down to the Southern Rim to restock their gear."`
				goto end

			label "new stock"
			`	"Yes, yes we do!" He walks up to you. "Nitrogen coolers, Heavy Rockets, radar jammers to ward off those pesky Lovelace Sidewinders, high-power afterburners, you name it. We've had a lot of requests to stock equipment from the Southern Rim, now with all the tension down there making it hard to do business."`
			`	The proprietor leans in towards you a little and says in a softer tone, "But you know, it's wrong to get supplies from the people who did those bombings and killed tens of thousands of people. It's simply wrong. Morally and commercially.`
			`	"Courtesy of Syndicated Systems, however, you can get southern gear here without supporting those secessionists! They saw an opportunity to get the rights for Delta V and Kraz equipment, and they took it. And you get to benefit," he chuckles.`

			label end
			`	He produces a brochure from his vest jacket and hands it to you. "Now, if you're interested in any of our new stock, just flag down one of our workers and we'll have it prepared and installed on your ship promptly.`
			`	"I wish you safe travels," he says, and returns to his office.`

		spaceport `Kosmoporto zostalo zbudowane na duzej wyspie, wygaslym wulkanie o wysokosci kilku kilometrow w centrum. Wiekszosc polowow na duza skale odbywa sie tu za posrednictwem jednej firmy, Poseidon Industries, ktora rowniez zbudowala i utrzymuje kosmoporto. Strome, krete drogi i solidne betonowe domy i magazyny ciagna sie wzdluz zboczy gor, a ponizej, w porcie, cumuje kilka poteznych tralowcow. Na obrzezach kosmoportu znajduja sie rozpadajace sie domy i targowisko na swiezym powietrzu, z ktorego korzystaja mniejsze, niezalezne rodziny rybackie.`
		spaceport `	Na polnoc od kosmoportu znajduje sie Pomnik Wojenny Wolnych Swiatow, seria granitowych murow z wyrytymi nazwiskami poleglych. Dwa dodatkowe pierscienie murow zostaly zbudowane wokol pierwszych dwudziestu trzech murow oraz piecdziesieciu murow starego pierscienia zewnetrznego.`

		description `	Zniszczone pozostalosci starej Stoczni Marynarki Wojennej wciaz stoja opuszczone i powoli rdzewieja w zracej atmosferze planety, lecz Republika wybudowala nowa stocznie, ktora zastapila te zniszczona w bombardowaniu, a Geminus po raz kolejny stal sie centralnym osrodkiem technologii i przemyslu.`
		spaceport `Jak wszystko inne na Geminusie, kosmodrom nie jest szczegolnie ladny, ale funkcjonalny i wydajny. Kazdy z szerokich korytarzy jest wytyczony jak droga, z przestrzenia posrodku dla wozkow elektrycznych przewozacych ladunki, a piesi sa zepchnieci na obrzeza. Kamery wideo i czujniki zostaly umieszczone na kazdym skrzyzowaniu, a dostep do stoczni jest scisle kontrolowany.`
		spaceport `	Centrum kosmodromu stanowi strefa gastronomiczna z pierscieniem sklepow posrodku i miejscami do siedzenia na zewnatrz, skad przez szklane okna mozna podziwiac pola lawy i kaldere. W nocy mozna podziwiac wulkaniczna poswiate na horyzoncie.`

		description `Martini to swiat egzotycznych plaz i idealnej pogody. Wczesniej miescily sie tu siedziby banku centralnego Republiki i galaktycznej gieldy papierow wartosciowych, zanim atak terrorystyczny zniszczyl je, a takze znaczna czesc dawnej stolicy.`
		description `	Nowa stolica znajduje sie po drugiej stronie kontynentu, gdzie utrzymujace sie promieniowanie nie wplynie na reszte populacji. Nie jest tak okazala jak stara stolica, ale jej populacja wzrosla dzieki przesiedleniom z napromieniowanych terenow i szybko zyskuje status duzej metropolii. Mieszkancy, z ktorych wielu to ocaleni z wybuchu, zjednoczyli sie wokol swego rodzaju postawy zrobie to dobrze, ktora pojawia sie dopiero po tak niszczycielskim i destrukcyjnym wydarzeniu.`
		spaceport `Obecnie nowo wyznaczony kosmodrom planetarny nie posiada infrastruktury, ktora pozwolilaby mu pelnic role glownego portu kosmicznego Martini. Rozlegly, tymczasowy kosmodrom z operacji ratunkowej jest nadal w uzyciu, a od tego czasu zbudowano stale ladowiska, ale obecnie planuje sie jego zburzenie i zapewnienie nowemu kosmodromowi planetarnemu pilnie potrzebnej rozbudowy.`
		spaceport `	Stary kosmodrom Martiniego wciaz istnieje, poniewaz znajdowal sie tuz poza strefa wybuchu, a jego oslony deflektorow poniosly najwieksze straty w wyniku fali uderzeniowej, ale jego wieze czesciowo zawalily sie w ciagu kilku dni po katastrofie. Teraz, z oddali, wyglada jak kilka nierownych, czarnych iglic wznoszacych sie na tle dymu i pozostalosci zrujnowanego miasta, ktore nie lsni juz tak jak kiedys.`
