		`	"It was easy for me, but I can't say it will be the same for your ships to combat."`

	`	The elders mumble among themselves about this information, periodically glancing down at what must be the message from Sayari detailing the Solifuge.`
	`	"We gather a large fleet above Cloudfire," one of the elders says, "and shortly afterward the Unfettered unveil this new ship. Perhaps it is only right that we respond in kind with a ship of our own."`
	`	"My son is an engineer," another elder says. "He helped create our Centipede and Geocoris ships, both as a result of the humans living among us. Perhaps he would be of assistance in creating a ship to respond to the Unfettered." The elder presses a button and leans over to a microphone. "Please bring Osen into the council chamber."`
	`	A short while later, the elder's son enters the chamber and introduces himself to the council. They tell him about the Unfettered having created a carrier and the need for a new ship to be created as a response, and Osen's eyes go wide.`
	`	Osen begins speaking very quickly in the Hai language, so fast that your translation device seems to barely be able to keep up.`
	`	"I have [exactly, precisely] the ship! My team has been [developing, producing] a ship for many [years, cycles] that carries a [fleet, squadron] of drones. We have [working, functional] [prototypes, models], but they are not yet [finished, complete]. We are still [developing, producing] technology to repair the [hull, armor] of a ship in flight, which would make this ship and its drones much more [effective, powerful]."`

	`	"It would only be a few weeks for us to have a number of prototype ships ready, but I highly suggest that we wait until we have created hull repair technology. If these Unfettered Solifuges do not have such technology, then having it will give our ship an advantage by being able to redeploy damaged drones, but we believe that we are still many years away from developing technology strong enough to be of any real use."`
	`	The elders once again mumble among themselves. They continue to ask Osen a number of questions about this new carrier. How difficult is one to produce? How much does it cost? What are the capabilities of the drones? How useful would it be without being able to repair the hull of its drones?`
	`	After having all their questions answered, the elders seem to be interested in the idea of Osen's new ship. "This hull repair technology indeed sounds necessary," an elder says. "We will provide what funding we can to help fast track its development."`
	`	Osen's father turns to you. "You have traveled many systems, <first> <last>. Perhaps you might be able to help. If you know of any peoples who have such technology from elsewhere in the galaxy, should it exist, then perhaps we could meet with them."`

			`When Rek meets you in the spaceport, he is in the Wanderer equivalent of a motorized wheelchair. He has lost even more of his brown and gray plumage, and nothing but thin, withered, black feathers have grown in their place, like dark hairs growing from diseased skin. You are not sure if he has lost weight, or the loss of feathers simply makes him appear more gaunt. "I am glad you are here, <first> <last>," he says.`

				`	"Don't worry, Iktat Rek. You'll make it through this."`
			`	He winces when you say his name. "You must not call me that anymore," he says. "'Iktat' was my role-name, and I can serve in that role no longer. I am now known only by my core-name of Rek, or my child-name Rek d' Esta'a i' Veruk. If I survive the Molt, I will become someone new, and will receive a new role-name as well."`

			label end
			`	It is not until you have wheeled him halfway up the ramp into your ship that you realize something: throughout the entire conversation, Rek was speaking to you in your native language, without using the translator. You had not realized that Wanderer vocal organs could mimic human speech so perfectly.`
			choice
				`	"Rek, when did you learn to speak my language?"`
			`	He makes a sound halfway between a laugh and a cough, and says, "Even as my body decays, my mind has grown sharper. The more I listened to your box speaking to you, the more its words began to make sense to me."`
			`	He seems too tired to answer any more questions. You make sure Rek is comfortable in one of your bunk rooms, then prepare to travel to <planet>.`
