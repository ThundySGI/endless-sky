And oversee will they the Wanderers, and judge if as benevolent as you say are they."`
			`	It is extremely strange that the first random Quarg you accosted in the hallway happened to be one with the authority to launch a fleet of warships, but it would be impolite to question such a generous, if extremely verbose offer. You thank the Quarg and return to your ship. Hopefully the Wanderers will be glad for the protection and will not object to having a Quarg fleet overhead scrutinizing their actions.`

			`When you last left <origin>, there were less than a dozen buildings in the greenhouse facility. It has now grown to the size of a major spaceport, including some towers that are dozens of stories high. Some plants now grow on open-air terraces; others are in domed enclosures tall enough to house fully-grown trees. The larger domes also have birds flying about inside them, and some larger land animals as well. Everything is built of gleaming steel and glass and filled with lush vegetation; from high above the facility looks like a scattered handful of diamonds and emeralds.`
			`	The transport you were escorting was full of professors and researchers, who are clearly not used to any sort of military discipline or to living in a dangerous region of space: the moment the transport lands they fly off toward the greenhouse without bothering to wait for instructions from their supposed manager. Several of them are already engaged in conversation with the drones, while others are exploring the different rooms of the facility, examining plants and probing soil with their talons.`

In fact, they're now so intrigued by the emergent Mereti consciousness that they don't seem to be thinking about the more distant threat of the drones in Kor Sestor space. Instead, they want to focus on their true calling: terraforming planets.`

			`Danforth's troops set up a defensive circle around the entrance to the Alpha base. It appears that they have achieved the element of surprise: the Alphas did not know that the Navy had already located their base, and were probably counting on having a longer time to evacuate. The troop transports were carrying concrete mixers and mining drills; apparently their plan is to seal the Alphas underground and then drill down through the ice and bedrock to bomb and collapse the bunker.`
			`	As the Navy troops begin pouring the concrete, the massive gate to the tunnel bursts open and more Alphas than you have ever seen in one place come flooding out, several dozen of them. But even these superhuman soldiers cannot survive the concentrated firepower of hundreds of Navy troops. The air fills with explosions and smoke and powdered snow, but as far as you can tell not one of the Alphas escapes alive.`

			`You inform the Wanderers that the Korath exiles are now producing war drones. "This is [unfortunate, regrettable]," says Sobari Tele'ek. "Clearly they [anticipate, expect] further conflict in the future."`
			`	Tema'a Iriket says, "Perhaps they are [afraid of, threatened by] us and seek only to have the means to [defend, protect] themselves. The important thing is that the drones in this [territory, area] have been [neutralized, pacified] and we can now focus on our true work."`
			`	From there, the conversation shifts to an excited discussion about what worlds they will settle on next and what their next steps should be in building relationships with the Kor Efret and the Kor Mereti collective. The exiles may become a threat some time in the future, but for now the Wanderers are eager to pursue their peacetime calling in this new territory that the Eye has led them to.`

		description `Ten suchy, goracy swiat jest niemal pozbawiony rodzimego zycia, ale jest idealny dla automatow Korath ze wzgledu na obfite zasoby energii slonecznej. W miejscach, gdzie kiedys znajdowaly sie miasta Korath, Kor Sestorowie zbudowali ogromne fabryki, ktorych budynki niekiedy osiagaly wysokosc niemal kilometra. W innych miejscach teren pozostaje niezabudowany i teraz, gdy fabryki zostaly zamkniete, wydaje sie prawdopodobne, ze pozostanie taki przez bardzo dlugi czas.`

		description `To zimny i gorzysty swiat, a wiekszosc jego oceanow pokryta jest lodem. Garstka gigantycznych kraterow wydrazonych w zboczach gor to jedyny slad po tym, ze kiedys istnialy tu osady Korath. Roboty Kor Sestor zaczely budowac wlasne osady w jaskiniach gleboko pod gorami, gdzie byly bezpieczne przed bombardowaniem orbitalnym, ale teraz te osady popadaja w ruine. Tam, gdzie ostatni atak Kor Mereti zawalil jeden z tuneli dostepowych, zebrala sie garstka robotow, bezskutecznie probujac je odkopac.`
