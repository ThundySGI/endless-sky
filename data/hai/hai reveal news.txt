			"Studying this planet will accelerate human science by decades. Maybe centuries. I think the Pug may have done us more good than harm."
			"I used to think the Pug were evil after all they did, but look at the consequences of their actions. We're at peace, we allied together as a single species, and we have endless technology to study."

			"It's odd, but some of the buildings near here bear a striking resemblance to ancient Minoan architecture. We also found tablets with Sanskrit writing and samples of ancient cave paintings. How long have the Pug been manipulating us?"
			"We're still studying what lies beyond the wormhole. There's a never-ending slue of discoveries from the Quarg ruins that are almost as valuable as what we found on this planet."
			"There are residual space-time distortions at the Quarg ringworld past the wormhole. We suspect it was moved in minutes. The energy required would be more than the total energy ever produced by the human race."
			"A ringworld is such a stupid idea. If you break clean through one piece, the centrifugal force tears the whole ring apart. If the Quarg were smart, they would've made a Dyson swarm instead."

			"I hear the Hai let pirates live in their territory, as part of reformation programs. That may not be the wisest decision they've ever made, but it's certainly a compassionate one."
			"I hope nobody is smuggling Hai technology to the pirates. I don't want to think of what would happen if pirates got their hands on that stuff."
			"I've flown through Cardax many times. How did I not notice there was a wormhole just a few systems away?"
			"I've made a fortune flying acorn cookies back here from Hai space. It's amazing how many people love them."
			"Last time I flew to Hai space, I visited the Quarg ringworld. If you fly to the inner edge of the ring and look out, the panorama is awe-inspiring."
			"The alloys Hai use in their ships are way beyond our technology. They're twice as strong with half the weight. No wonder their ships are so fast."
			"Don't go too far north in Hai space. They have their own pirates, and they're much more powerful than anything we're used to in human space."
			"I hear Hai space wasn't peaceful a few centuries ago when some reptilian aliens were raiding the place. I wonder where they went?"
