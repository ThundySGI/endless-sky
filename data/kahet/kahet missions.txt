event "graveyard insights"
	planet Alix
		add description `	Here the Ka'het attacks were limited to the inhabited settlements; had they also destroyed the mining bases and the unmanned vessels, Parii'het would have run out of supplies thousands of years ago.`
	planet Celeatis
		add description `	This planet appears to have been home to one of the largest Builder research centers, which focused on studying the anomaly in the system. Had they found out how to stabilize it and use it as a wormhole, perhaps their species would have survived and spread to the rest of the Ember Waste.`
	planet Ceilia'sei
		add description `	The main purpose of Ceilia'sei was to act as some sort of anti-missile platform, but when the Ka'het invaded a second time, the station had no way to defend against their deadly Ravager Beams, and the station's defense systems were subsequently lost forever.`
	planet Eavine
		add description `	This moon was also home for the second Ka'het wave, which, same as the first, refused to obey their creators. It had been terraformed to make it a more appealing place to live, but after their civilization collapsed the moon began to return to its natural state. When it reverted to its original sub-zero temperatures, the facilities stopped working, and the Ka'het production in this site came to an end.`
	planet "Letis'sei"
		add description `	As it was designed to be crewed as minimally as possible, only a tiny fraction of Letis'sei station was inhabitable. The rest of the station was instead dedicated to advanced computing and targeting systems, most of which are still intact today.`
	planet Osaeli
		add description `	For most of the intervening millennia between the Builders' achievement of spaceflight and their extinction, Osaeli was the de facto capital of the Builders, a key part of their economy and society. The first Het station was constructed orbiting this planet's star with the purpose of protecting them from any external threat.`
	planet Palarei
		add description `	Thanks to their earlier exploration efforts, this was where the Builders encountered the first lifeforms that evolved outside their home planet. While the climate was drastically different from that of the Builders' homeworld, the fruits the local flora produced were popular enough for Palarei to become a major farming planet.`
	planet Parii'het
		add description `	Parii'het was almost finished when the invasion broke out, and already capable of creating Ka'het. Thanks to the mining on Alix and the occasional asteroid mine operated by the Mar drones, most of the facilities are still fully operational to this day.`
	planet Retilie
		add description `	As it was mainly used for fishing, the settlements on this planet were never as advanced as the ones on nearby worlds, so when the Ka'het arrived, there was basically nothing to stop them: after a few attacks, the planet was uninhabited again.`
	planet Seli'het
		add description `	This was the only Het station the Builders ever completed, orbiting Giribea. As the young Ka'heta reach their "Age of Assembly," strange, lanky machines start molding an exoskeleton onto their bodies right away. As the Ka'heta grow, their exoskeleton is expanded and various outfits are added, transforming them into living weapons.`
	planet Siteria
		add description `	This was the Builder homeworld; both the place where their journey began and where it ended. After a dozen millennia of underpopulation, the Ka'het arrival forced them to withdraw from the planet entirely. As one of the few remaining planets capable of sustaining farming, this was their last stronghold, falling centuries after the invasion begun.`
	planet Veliante
		add description `	Soon after the beginning the invasion, an attack on some sort of advanced nuclear facility started a meltdown; the fallout quickly spread across most of the planet, leaving all Builder settlements uninhabitable.`

# The mission here is a complex mashup of game functions that uses many different mechanics to achieve the intended sequence:
# - two ships spawn, one disabled and one functional (but otherwise standing still);
# - the player boards the disabled ship, with the mission happening before their eyes;
# - the other ships jump away right after the mission, and the one the player boarded returns to its normal functions.
# In order to achieve this, the asteroid ship has just over 200 fuel and a negative fuel generation, meaning that it will be unable to jump essentially right after it spawns; removing the spaceport means that it won't be able to refuel on the Builder settlement, and so it remains in space doing nothing but waiting. When the player boards the disabled NPC, it is repaired and returns to its functions; as it is an enemy of the asteroid ship, it will shoot it with every available weapon, including what has been hidden under "Ka'het Machinery": a negative fuel damage weapon, that will instantly refill its fuel reserves and let it jump. Giving it just a capacity of 200 would mean that the game would always think it is just infinitesimally under the threshold to jump, so I gave it 250 and everything works as it should with surprising consistency. Two peculiarities of this are that the player will be able to board the asteroid ship to refuel it, and that the Ka'sei could shoot the asteroid with its ravagers for a split second before it jumps if the position of the two is just right. Both of them are harmless: the health of the asteroid is orders of magnitude higher than the damage the Ka'sei can inflict in that time, and as the player boarding the asteroid will give it exactly 200 fuel because of game mechanics, 1 single frame later it will be already unable to jump. However, in order to account for their oddity I added a small dialog to the asteroid's boarding screen to make it as if you were flying by it, and described at the end of the previous mission how for an instant the Ravagers ignite when the Ka'sei returns online, as if in an unintended burst.
