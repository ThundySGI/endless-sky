			"A sizable crowd is watching one of the monitors in the spaceport where an interviewer is speaking to a Heliarch agent. You learn from someone in the crowd that the agent was a professional athlete until recently."
			"A news broadcast shows footage of many Heliarch agents arresting a group of terrorists. The Heliarch who was supervising the operation is later interviewed, explaining that the new prisoners were found to have stolen government equipment."
			"The news show a Heliarch consul giving a short speech in a ship launching ceremony. After they finish, the brand new Heliarch warships are shown heading to their first patrol."
			"All the spaceport screens momentarily swap to a broadcast from the Heliarch government, where they show a video of several dozens of arrested criminals. The Heliarch host describing the event mentions their sentences range from 40 years to life, prompting varying reactions from the civilian spectators."
			"During one of the more busy hours on the spaceport, the news details the crimes of a recently arrested terrorist group: arson, kidnapping, theft of government equipment, possession of weapons, conspiring against the Coalition, attacking both government and civilian properties, subversion... The list goes on for a few more minutes."

			"A short film plays on a monitor during a commercial break. A young Saryd walks in a forest, looking to his sides every few seconds to take in the view. Eventually he turns to see another Saryd, both surprised. As he approaches her and the two start talking, the camera pans out to a rising sun over the forest."
			"A local screen shows a stressed Saryd working at a computer late at night. The door creaks, and she looks back to find her children peeking. She puts them to sleep and then goes to bed herself. After waking up, she finds nobody around the house. She goes outside, seeing the children, along with their father, admiring the sun rising."
			"After a government broadcast, a timelapse plays on a spaceport monitor, showcasing Ring of Friendship gaining more and more solar panels on its exterior over the centuries."
			"During a break, a recruitment advertisement plays. A recruit of each species is shown putting on their brand new uniforms, then training on some sort of obstacle track, and then the view switches to troops marching in unison in the Academy of Cadets of Belug's Plunge."

			"An ad shows various graphs of what you guess are stock values. An Arach leg swipes the view, and the graphs begin fluctuating a lot more to one side. At the end, the logo of House Plumtab flashes on the screen."
			"An ad for an energy drink is on display on a local shop. A Kimek is down on the ground in the middle of the streets, struggling to move, as a crowd gathers around them. When they get the drink, they jump up and bolt past the crowd, and then proceed to climb up a skyscraper. At the end a disclaimer advises against Saryds consuming the drink."

			"A Saryd game is playing on a monitor nearby. The athletes, separated into two teams, gallop around an uneven field, dotted with small mounds and holes, as they try to whack some balls into nets located around the arena's edges. Your best guess is that it's an awfully convoluted mix of cricket, football, and pool."
			"A crowd has gathered for the transmission, waiting for some kind of race or marathon to start. The camera pans by the competitors, who are all Kimek, then pulls back as the race begins. You judge it to be a pretty standard race initially, until the camera spins around, and it's made clear that the Kimek are running upside down."
			"Some Arachi attentively wait for a game to start. The screen shows the competitors, who are also Arachi, putting on various layers of plate armor. They then all move to a metal cable, just thick enough for them to be gripped with all legs. They then stay there. For many minutes. Until they start falling one by one. Exhilarating."
			"During a break from the games, some analysts go over spreadsheets with the statistics for the competitors of the past few games. You can't read any of it, but passerby workers and captains stay a while to glance at the results."
			"One of the competitors from the last game, still catching their breath from the event, is giving an interview and gulping down water every time the interviewer talks. Given their excitement, you figure they must've performed very well."
